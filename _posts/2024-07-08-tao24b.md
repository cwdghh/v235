title: 'Learning in Feature Spaces via Coupled Covariances: Asymmetric Kernel SVD
  and Nyström method'
openreview: Gp0xZDmrA2
abstract: In contrast with Mercer kernel-based approaches as used e.g. in Kernel Principal
  Component Analysis (KPCA), it was previously shown that Singular Value Decomposition
  (SVD) inherently relates to asymmetric kernels and Asymmetric Kernel Singular Value
  Decomposition (KSVD) has been proposed. However, the existing formulation to KSVD
  cannot work with infinite-dimensional feature mappings, the variational objective
  can be unbounded, and needs further numerical evaluation and exploration towards
  machine learning. In this work, i) we introduce a new asymmetric learning paradigm
  based on coupled covariance eigenproblem (CCE) through covariance operators, allowing
  infinite-dimensional feature maps. The solution to CCE is ultimately obtained from
  the SVD of the induced asymmetric kernel matrix, providing links to KSVD. ii) Starting
  from the integral equations corresponding to a pair of coupled adjoint eigenfunctions,
  we formalize the asymmetric Nyström method through a finite sample approximation
  to speed up training. iii) We provide the first empirical evaluations verifying
  the practical utility and benefits of KSVD and compare with methods resorting to
  symmetrization or linear SVD across multiple tasks.
