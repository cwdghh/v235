title: Continuous Treatment Effects with Surrogate Outcomes
openreview: cZNuYKtoOZ
abstract: In many real-world causal inference applications, the primary outcomes (labels)
  are often partially missing, especially if they are expensive or difficult to collect.
  If the missingness depends on covariates (i.e., missingness is not completely at
  random), analyses based on fully observed samples alone may be biased. Incorporating
  surrogates, which are fully observed post-treatment variables related to the primary
  outcome, can improve estimation in this case. In this paper, we study the role of
  surrogates in estimating continuous treatment effects and propose a doubly robust
  method to efficiently incorporate surrogates in the analysis, which uses both labeled
  and unlabeled data and does not suffer from the above selection bias problem. Importantly,
  we establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator and show possible
  improvements on the variance compared with methods that solely use labeled data.
  Extensive simulations show our methods enjoy appealing empirical performance.
