title: 'Seizing Serendipity: Exploiting the Value of Past Success in Off-Policy Actor-Critic'
openreview: 9Tq4L3Go9f
abstract: Learning high-quality $Q$-value functions plays a key role in the success
  of many modern off-policy deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Previous
  works primarily focus on addressing the value overestimation issue, an outcome of
  adopting function approximators and off-policy learning. Deviating from the common
  viewpoint, we observe that $Q$-values are often underestimated in the latter stage
  of the RL training process, potentially hindering policy learning and reducing sample
  efficiency. We find that such a long-neglected phenomenon is often related to the
  use of inferior actions from the current policy in Bellman updates as compared to
  the more optimal action samples in the replay buffer. We propose the Blended Exploitation
  and Exploration (BEE) operator, a simple yet effective approach that updates $Q$-value
  using both historical best-performing actions and the current policy. Based on BEE,
  the resulting practical algorithm BAC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in <b>over
  50</b> continuous control tasks and achieves strong performance in failure-prone
  scenarios and <b>real-world robot</b> tasks. Benchmark results and videos are available
  at https://jity16.github.io/BEE/.
