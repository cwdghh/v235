title: Robust and Conjugate Gaussian Process Regression
openreview: 5WnKLIAX4q
abstract: To enable closed form conditioning, a common assumption in Gaussian process
  (GP) regression is independent and identically distributed Gaussian observation
  noise. This strong and simplistic assumption is often violated in practice, which
  leads to unreliable inferences and uncertainty quantification. Unfortunately, existing
  methods for robustifying GPs break closed-form conditioning, which makes them less
  attractive to practitioners and significantly more computationally expensive. In
  this paper, we demonstrate how to perform provably robust and conjugate Gaussian
  process (RCGP) regression at virtually no additional cost using generalised Bayesian
  inference. RCGP is particularly versatile as it enables exact conjugate closed form
  updates in all settings where standard GPs admit them. To demonstrate its strong
  empirical performance, we deploy RCGP for problems ranging from Bayesian optimisation
  to sparse variational Gaussian processes.
