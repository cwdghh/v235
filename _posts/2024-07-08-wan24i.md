title: Towards Unified Multi-granularity Text Detection with Interactive Attention
openreview: HaBVzgSdM7
abstract: Existing OCR engines or document image analysis systems typically rely on
  training separate models for text detection in varying scenarios and granularities,
  leading to significant computational complexity and resource demands. In this paper,
  we introduce "Detect Any Text" (DAT), an advanced paradigm that seamlessly unifies
  scene text detection, layout analysis, and document page detection into a cohesive,
  end-to-end model. This design enables DAT to efficiently manage text instances at
  different granularities, including <em>word</em>, <em>line</em>, <em>paragraph</em>
  and <em>page</em>. A pivotal innovation in DAT is the across-granularity interactive
  attention module, which significantly enhances the representation learning of text
  instances at varying granularities by correlating structural information across
  different text queries. As a result, it enables the model to achieve mutually beneficial
  detection performances across multiple text granularities. Additionally, a prompt-based
  segmentation module refines detection outcomes for texts of arbitrary curvature
  and complex layouts, thereby improving DATâ€™s accuracy and expanding its real-world
  applicability. Experimental results demonstrate that DAT achieves state-of-the-art
  performances across a variety of text-related benchmarks, including multi-oriented/arbitrarily-shaped
  scene text detection, document layout analysis and page detection tasks.
