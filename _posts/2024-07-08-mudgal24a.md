title: Controlled Decoding from Language Models
openreview: bVIcZb7Qa0
abstract: KL-regularized reinforcement learning (RL) is a popular alignment framework
  to control the language model responses towards high reward outcomes. We pose a
  tokenwise RL objective and propose a modular solver for it, called <em>controlled
  decoding (CD)</em>. CD exerts control through a separate <em>prefix scorer</em>
  module, which is trained to learn a value function for the reward. The prefix scorer
  is used at inference time to control the generation from a frozen base model, provably
  sampling from a solution to the RL objective. We empirically demonstrate that CD
  is effective as a control mechanism on popular benchmarks. We also show that prefix
  scorers for multiple rewards may be combined at inference time, effectively solving
  a multi-objective RL problem with no additional training. We show that the benefits
  of applying CD transfer to an unseen base model with no further tuning as well.
  Finally, we show that CD can be applied in a blockwise decoding fashion at inference-time,
  essentially bridging the gap between the popular best-of-$K$ strategy and tokenwise
  control through reinforcement learning. This makes CD a promising approach for alignment
  of language models.
