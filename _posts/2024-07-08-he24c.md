title: 'Two Stones Hit One Bird: Bilevel Positional Encoding for Better Length Extrapolation'
openreview: luqH1eL4PN
abstract: In this work, we leverage the intrinsic segmentation of language sequences
  and design a new positional encoding method called Bilevel Positional Encoding (BiPE).
  For each position, our BiPE blends an intra-segment encoding and an inter-segment
  encoding. The intra-segment encoding identifies the locations within a segment and
  helps the model capture the semantic information therein via absolute positional
  encoding. The inter-segment encoding specifies the segment index, models the relationships
  between segments, and aims to improve extrapolation capabilities via relative positional
  encoding. Theoretical analysis shows this disentanglement of positional information
  makes learning more effective. The empirical results also show that our BiPE has
  superior length extrapolation capabilities across a wide range of tasks in diverse
  text modalities.
