title: 'Triadic-OCD: Asynchronous Online Change Detection with Provable Robustness,
  Optimality, and Convergence'
openreview: OnkA4zaEU9
abstract: The primary goal of online change detection (OCD) is to promptly identify
  changes in the data stream. OCD problem find a wide variety of applications in diverse
  areas, e.g., security detection in smart grids and intrusion detection in communication
  networks. Prior research usually assumes precise knowledge of the system parameters.
  Nevertheless, this presumption often proves unattainable in practical scenarios
  due to factors such as estimation errors, system updates, etc. This paper aims to
  take the first attempt to develop a triadic-OCD framework with certifiable robustness,
  provable optimality, and guaranteed convergence. In addition, the proposed triadic-OCD
  algorithm can be realized in a fully asynchronous distributed manner, easing the
  necessity of transmitting the data to a single server. This asynchronous mechanism
  could also mitigate the straggler issue that faced by traditional synchronous algorithm.
  Moreover, the non-asymptotic convergence property of Triadic-OCD is theoretically
  analyzed, and its iteration complexity to achieve an $\epsilon$-optimal point is
  derived. Extensive experiments have been conducted to elucidate the effectiveness
  of the proposed method.
