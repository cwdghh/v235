title: Generalization Analysis of Deep Non-linear Matrix Completion
openreview: 40foON48am
abstract: We provide generalization bounds for matrix completion with Schatten $p$
  quasi-norm constraints, which is equivalent to deep matrix factorization with Frobenius
  constraints. In the uniform sampling regime, the sample complexity scales like $\widetilde{O}\left(
  rn\right)$ where $n$ is the size of the matrix and $r$ is a constraint of the same
  order as the ground truth rank in the isotropic case. In the distribution-free setting,
  the bounds scale as $\widetilde{O}\left(r^{1-\frac{p}{2}}n^{1+\frac{p}{2}}\right)$,
  which reduces to the familiar $\sqrt{r}n^{\frac{3}{2}}$ for $p=1$. Furthermore,
  we provide an analogue of the weighted trace norm for this setting which brings
  the sample complexity down to $\widetilde{O}(nr)$ in all cases. We then present
  a non-linear model, Functionally Rescaled Matrix Completion (FRMC) which applies
  a single trainable function from $\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ to each entry
  of a latent matrix, and prove that this adds only negligible terms of the overall
  sample complexity, whilst experiments demonstrate that this simple model improvement
  already leads to significant gains on real data. We also provide extensions of our
  results to various neural architectures, thereby providing the first comprehensive
  uniform convergence PAC analysis of neural network matrix completion.
