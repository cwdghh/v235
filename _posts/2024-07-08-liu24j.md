title: Zeroth-Order Methods for Constrained Nonconvex Nonsmooth Stochastic Optimization
openreview: PxHmxoFOgI
abstract: This paper studies the problem of solving nonconvex nonsmooth optimization
  over a closed convex set. Most previous works tackle such problems by transforming
  the constrained problem into an unconstrained problem that can be solved by the
  techniques developed in the unconstrained setting. However, they only provide asymptotic
  convergence analysis for their methods. In this work, we provide the non-asymptotic
  analysis for solving constrained nonconvex nonsmooth optimization. We first generalize
  classical gradient mapping and the Frankâ€“Wolfe gap in the nonsmooth setting. Then
  we introduce novel notions of approximate stationarity concerning such generalized
  quantities. We also propose several stochastic zeroth-order algorithms for the problem,
  along with their non-asymptotic convergence guarantees of obtaining the proposed
  approximate stationarity. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments that demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our algorithms.
