title: Agnostic Sample Compression Schemes for Regression
openreview: 71ktaA3ihI
abstract: 'We obtain the first positive results for bounded sample compression in
  the agnostic regression setting with the $\ell_p$ loss, where $p\in [1,\infty]$.
  We construct a generic approximate sample compression scheme for real-valued function
  classes exhibiting exponential size in the fat-shattering dimension but independent
  of the sample size. Notably, for linear regression, an approximate compression of
  size linear in the dimension is constructed. Moreover, for $\ell_1$ and $\ell_\infty$
  losses, we can even exhibit an efficient exact sample compression scheme of size
  linear in the dimension. We further show that for every other $\ell_p$ loss, $p\in
  (1,\infty)$, there does not exist an exact agnostic compression scheme of bounded
  size. This refines and generalizes a negative result of David, Moran, and Yehudayoff
  (2016) for the $\ell_2$ loss. We close by posing general open questions: for agnostic
  regression with $\ell_1$ loss, does every function class admit an exact compression
  scheme of polynomial size in the pseudo-dimension? For the $\ell_2$ loss, does every
  function class admit an approximate compression scheme of polynomial size in the
  fat-shattering dimension? These questions generalize Warmuthâ€™s classic sample compression
  conjecture for realizable-case classification (Warmuth, 2003).'
