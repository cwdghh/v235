title: 'TimeX++: Learning Time-Series Explanations with Information Bottleneck'
openreview: t6dBpwkbea
abstract: Explaining deep learning models operating on time series data is crucial
  in various applications of interest which require interpretable and transparent
  insights from time series signals. In this work, we investigate this problem from
  an information theoretic perspective and show that most existing measures of explainability
  may suffer from trivial solutions and distributional shift issues. To address these
  issues, we introduce a simple yet practical objective function for time series explainable
  learning. The design of the objective function builds upon the principle of information
  bottleneck (IB), and modifies the IB objective function to avoid trivial solutions
  and distributional shift issues. We further present TimeX++, a novel explanation
  framework that leverages a parametric network to produce explanation-embedded instances
  that are both in-distributed and label-preserving. We evaluate TimeX++ on both synthetic
  and real-world datasets comparing its performance against leading baselines, and
  validate its practical efficacy through case studies in a real-world environmental
  application. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that TimeX++ outperforms
  baselines across all datasets, demonstrating a substantial improvement in explanation
  quality for time series data. The source code is available at https://github.com/zichuan-liu/TimeXplusplus.
