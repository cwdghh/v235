title: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Anatomical Structure Detection in Ultrasound
  Images
openreview: meItvvCO7X
abstract: Models trained on ultrasound images from one institution typically experience
  a decline in effectiveness when transferred directly to other institutions. Moreover,
  unlike natural images, dense and overlapped structures exist in fetus ultrasound
  images, making the detection of structures more challenging. Thus, to tackle this
  problem, we propose a new Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) method named ToMo-UDA
  for fetus structure detection, which consists of the Topology Knowledge Transfer
  (TKT) and the Morphology Knowledge Transfer (MKT) module. The TKT leverages prior
  knowledge of the medical anatomy of fetal as topological information, reconstructing
  and aligning anatomy features across source and target domains. Then, the MKT formulates
  a more consistent and independent morphological representation for each substructure
  of an organ. To evaluate the proposed ToMo-UDA for ultrasound fetal anatomical structure
  detection, we introduce <b>FUSH$^2$</b>, a new <b>F</b>etal <b>U</b>ltra<b>S</b>ound
  benchmark, comprises <b>H</b>eart and <b>H</b>ead images collected from <b>Two</b>
  health centers, with 16 annotated regions. Our experiments show that utilizing topological
  and morphological anatomy information in ToMo-UDA can greatly improve organ structure
  detection. This expands the potential for structure detection tasks in medical image
  analysis.
