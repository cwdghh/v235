title: 'Slow and Steady Wins the Race: Maintaining Plasticity with Hare and Tortoise
  Networks'
openreview: VF177x7Syw
abstract: 'This study investigates the loss of generalization ability in neural networks,
  revisiting warm-starting experiments from Ash & Adams. Our empirical analysis reveals
  that common methods designed to enhance plasticity by maintaining trainability provide
  limited benefits to generalization. While reinitializing the network can be effective,
  it also risks losing valuable prior knowledge. To this end, we introduce the Hare
  & Tortoise, inspired by the brain’s complementary learning system. Hare & Tortoise
  consists of two components: the Hare network, which rapidly adapts to new information
  analogously to the hippocampus, and the Tortoise network, which gradually integrates
  knowledge akin to the neocortex. By periodically reinitializing the Hare network
  to the Tortoise’s weights, our method preserves plasticity while retaining general
  knowledge. Hare & Tortoise can effectively maintain the network’s ability to generalize,
  which improves advanced reinforcement learning algorithms on the Atari-100k benchmark.
  The code is available at https://github.com/dojeon-ai/hare-tortoise.'
