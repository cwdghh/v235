title: Bayesian Exploration Networks
openreview: OYw6sS8QmL
abstract: Bayesian reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled and elegant approach
  for sequential decision making under uncertainty. Most notably, Bayesian agents
  do not face an exploration/exploitation dilemma, a major pathology of frequentist
  methods. However theoretical understanding of model-free approaches is lacking.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel Bayesian model-free formulation and the first
  analysis showing that model-free approaches can yield Bayes-optimal policies. We
  show all existing model-free approaches make approximations that yield policies
  that can be arbitrarily Bayes-suboptimal. As a first step towards model-free Bayes
  optimality, we introduce the Bayesian exploration network (BEN) which uses normalising
  flows to model both the aleatoric uncertainty (via density estimation) and epistemic
  uncertainty (via variational inference) in the Bellman operator. In the limit of
  complete optimisation, BEN learns true Bayes-optimal policies, but like in variational
  expectation-maximisation, partial optimisation renders our approach tractable. Empirical
  results demonstrate that BEN can learn true Bayes-optimal policies in tasks where
  existing model-free approaches fail.
