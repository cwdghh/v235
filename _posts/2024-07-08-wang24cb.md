title: Defense against Model Extraction Attack by Bayesian Active Watermarking
openreview: EFtNP211X3
abstract: 'Model extraction is to obtain a cloned model that replicates the functionality
  of a black-box victim model solely through query-based access. Present defense strategies
  exhibit shortcomings, manifesting as: (1) computational or memory inefficiencies
  during deployment; or (2) dependence on expensive defensive training methods that
  mandate the re-training of the victim model; or (3) watermarking-based methods only
  <em>passively</em> detect model theft without actively preventing model extraction.
  To address these limitations, we introduce an innovative Bayesian <em>active</em>
  watermarking technique to fine-tune the victim model and learn the watermark posterior
  distribution conditioned on input data. The fine-tuning process aims to maximize
  the log-likelihood on watermarked in-distribution training data for preserving model
  utility while simultaneously maximizing the change of modelâ€™s outputs on watermarked
  out-of-distribution data, thereby achieving effective defense. During deployment,
  a watermark is randomly sampled from the estimated watermark posterior. This watermark
  is then added to the input query, and the victim model returns the prediction based
  on the watermarked input query to users. This proactive defense approach requires
  only slight fine-tuning of the victim model without the need of full re-training
  and demonstrates high efficiency in terms of memory and computation during deployment.
  Rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive experimental results demonstrate
  the efficacy of our proposed method.'
