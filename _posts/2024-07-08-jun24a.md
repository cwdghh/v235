title: Noise-Adaptive Confidence Sets for Linear Bandits and Application to Bayesian
  Optimization
openreview: W8hBNk1FhQ
abstract: Adapting to a priori unknown noise level is a very important but challenging
  problem in sequential decision-making as efficient exploration typically requires
  knowledge of the noise level, which is often loosely specified. We report significant
  progress in addressing this issue in linear bandits in two respects. First, we propose
  a novel confidence set that is ’semi-adaptive’ to the unknown sub-Gaussian parameter
  $\sigma_*^2$ in the sense that the (normalized) confidence width scales with $\sqrt{d\sigma_*^2
  + \sigma_0^2}$ where $d$ is the dimension and $\sigma_0^2$ is the specified sub-Gaussian
  parameter (known) that can be much larger than $\sigma_*^2$. This is a significant
  improvement over $\sqrt{d\sigma_0^2}$ of the standard confidence set of Abbasi-Yadkori
  et al. (2011), especially when $d$ is large. We show that this leads to an improved
  regret bound in linear bandits. Second, for bounded rewards, we propose a novel
  variance-adaptive confidence set that has a much improved numerical performance
  upon prior art. We then apply this confidence set to develop, as we claim, the first
  practical variance-adaptive linear bandit algorithm via an optimistic approach,
  which is enabled by our novel regret analysis technique. Both of our confidence
  sets rely critically on ‘regret equality’ from online learning. Our empirical evaluation
  in Bayesian optimization tasks shows that our algorithms demonstrate better or comparable
  performance compared to existing methods.
