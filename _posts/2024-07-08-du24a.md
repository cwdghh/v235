title: Principled Gradient-Based MCMC for Conditional Sampling of Text
openreview: AwLLSlJAeJ
abstract: We consider the problem of sampling text from an energy-based model. This
  arises, for example, when sampling text from a neural language model subject to
  soft constraints. Although the target distribution is discrete, the internal computations
  of the energy function (given by the language model) are differentiable, so one
  would like to exploit gradient information within a method such as MCMC. Alas, all
  previous attempts to generalize gradient-based MCMC to text sampling fail to sample
  correctly from the target distribution. We propose a solution, along with variants,
  and study its theoretical properties. Through experiments on various forms of text
  generation, we demonstrate that our unbiased samplers are able to generate more
  fluent text while better adhering to the control objectives. The same methods could
  be used to sample from discrete energy-based models unrelated to text.
