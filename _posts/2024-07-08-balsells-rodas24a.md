title: On the Identifiability of Switching Dynamical Systems
openreview: Eew3yUQQtE
abstract: The identifiability of latent variable models has received increasing attention
  due to its relevance in interpretability and out-of-distribution generalisation.
  In this work, we study the identifiability of Switching Dynamical Systems, taking
  an initial step toward extending identifiability analysis to sequential latent variable
  models. We first prove the identifiability of Markov Switching Models, which commonly
  serve as the prior distribution for the continuous latent variables in Switching
  Dynamical Systems. We present identification conditions for first-order Markov dependency
  structures, whose transition distribution is parametrised via non-linear Gaussians.
  We then establish the identifiability of the latent variables and non-linear mappings
  in Switching Dynamical Systems up to affine transformations, by leveraging identifiability
  analysis techniques from identifiable deep latent variable models. We finally develop
  estimation algorithms for identifiable Switching Dynamical Systems. Throughout empirical
  studies, we demonstrate the practicality of identifiable Switching Dynamical Systems
  for segmenting high-dimensional time series such as videos, and showcase the use
  of identifiable Markov Switching Models for regime-dependent causal discovery in
  climate data.
