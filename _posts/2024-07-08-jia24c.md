title: Chain-of-Thought Predictive Control
openreview: 9xUpLGAOy9
abstract: We study generalizable policy learning from demonstrations for complex low-level
  control (e.g., contact-rich object manipulations). We propose a novel hierarchical
  imitation learning method that utilizes sub-optimal demos. Firstly, we propose an
  observation space-agnostic approach that efficiently discovers the multi-step subskill
  decomposition of the demos in an unsupervised manner. By grouping temporarily close
  and functionally similar actions into subskill-level demo segments, the observations
  at the segment boundaries constitute a chain of planning steps for the task, which
  we refer to as the chain-of-thought (CoT). Next, we propose a Transformer-based
  design that effectively learns to predict the CoT as the subskill-level guidance.
  We couple action and subskill predictions via learnable prompt tokens and a hybrid
  masking strategy, which enable dynamically updated guidance at test time and improve
  feature representation of the trajectory for generalizable policy learning. Our
  method, Chain-of-Thought Predictive Control (CoTPC), consistently surpasses existing
  strong baselines on various challenging low-level manipulation tasks with sub-optimal
  demos. See project page at https://sites.google.com/view/cotpc.
