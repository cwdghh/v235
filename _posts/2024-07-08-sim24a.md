title: Deletion-Anticipative Data Selection with a Limited Budget
openreview: ecvuJWE1YY
abstract: 'Learners with a limited budget can use supervised data subset selection
  and active learning techniques to select a smaller training set and reduce the cost
  of acquiring data and training <em>machine learning</em> (ML) models. However, the
  resulting high model performance, measured by a data utility function, may not be
  preserved when some data owners, enabled by the GDPR’s right to erasure, request
  their data to be deleted from the ML model. This raises an important question for
  learners who are temporarily unable or unwilling to acquire data again: <em>During
  the initial data acquisition of a training set of size $k$, can we proactively maximize
  the data utility after future unknown deletions?</em> We propose that the learner
  anticipates/estimates the probability that (i) each data owner in the feasible set
  will independently delete its data or (ii) a number of deletions occur out of $k$,
  and justify our proposal with concrete real-world use cases. Then, instead of directly
  maximizing the data utility function, the learner can maximize the expected or risk-averse
  post-deletion utility based on the anticipated probabilities. We further propose
  how to construct these <em>deletion-anticipative data selection</em> ($\texttt{DADS}$)
  maximization objectives to preserve monotone submodularity and near-optimality of
  greedy solutions, how to optimize the objectives and empirically evaluate $\texttt{DADS}$’
  performance on real-world datasets.'
