title: 'Agent-Specific Effects: A Causal Effect Propagation Analysis in Multi-Agent
  MDPs'
openreview: pmncWWkGMz
abstract: Establishing causal relationships between actions and outcomes is fundamental
  for accountable multi-agent decision-making. However, interpreting and quantifying
  agents’ contributions to such relationships pose significant challenges. These challenges
  are particularly prominent in the context of multi-agent sequential decision-making,
  where the causal effect of an agent’s action on the outcome depends on how other
  agents respond to that action. In this paper, our objective is to present a systematic
  approach for attributing the causal effects of agents’ actions to the influence
  they exert on other agents. Focusing on multi-agent Markov decision processes, we
  introduce agent-specific effects (ASE), a novel causal quantity that measures the
  effect of an agent’s action on the outcome that propagates through other agents.
  We then turn to the counterfactual counterpart of ASE (cf-ASE), provide a sufficient
  set of conditions for identifying cf-ASE, and propose a practical sampling-based
  algorithm for estimating it. Finally, we experimentally evaluate the utility of
  cf-ASE through a simulation-based testbed, which includes a sepsis management environment.
