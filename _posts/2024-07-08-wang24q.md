title: 'Swallowing the Bitter Pill: Simplified Scalable Conformer Generation'
openreview: I44Em5D5xy
abstract: We present a novel way to predict molecular conformers through a simple
  formulation that sidesteps many of the heuristics of prior works and achieves state
  of the art results by using the advantages of scale. By training a diffusion generative
  model directly on 3D atomic positions without making assumptions about the explicit
  structure of molecules (e.g. modeling torsional angles) we are able to radically
  simplify structure learning, and make it trivial to scale up the model sizes. This
  model, called Molecular Conformer Fields (MCF), works by parameterizing conformer
  structures as functions that map elements from a molecular graph directly to their
  3D location in space. This formulation allows us to boil down the essence of structure
  prediction to learning a distribution over functions. Experimental results show
  that scaling up the model capacity leads to large gains in generalization performance
  without enforcing inductive biases like rotational equivariance. MCF represents
  an advance in extending diffusion models to handle complex scientific problems in
  a conceptually simple, scalable and effective manner.
