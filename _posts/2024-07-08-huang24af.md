title: 'InterLUDE: Interactions between Labeled and Unlabeled Data to Enhance Semi-Supervised
  Learning'
openreview: wilej5VnqL
abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) seeks to enhance task performance by training
  on both labeled and unlabeled data. Mainstream SSL image classification methods
  mostly optimize a loss that additively combines a supervised classification objective
  with a regularization term derived <em>solely</em> from unlabeled data. This formulation
  often neglects the potential for interaction between labeled and unlabeled images.
  In this paper, we introduce InterLUDE, a new approach to enhance SSL made of two
  parts that each benefit from labeled-unlabeled interaction. The first part, embedding
  fusion, interpolates between labeled and unlabeled embeddings to improve representation
  learning. The second part is a new loss, grounded in the principle of consistency
  regularization, that aims to minimize discrepancies in the modelâ€™s predictions between
  labeled versus unlabeled inputs. Experiments on standard closed-set SSL benchmarks
  and a medical SSL task with an uncurated unlabeled set show clear benefits to our
  approach. On the STL-10 dataset with only 40 labels, InterLUDE achieves <b>3.2%</b>
  error rate, while the best previous method reports 6.3%.
