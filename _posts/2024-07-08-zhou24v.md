title: Effective Federated Graph Matching
openreview: rSfzchjIYu
abstract: Graph matching in the setting of federated learning is still an open problem.
  This paper proposes an unsupervised federated graph matching algorithm, UFGM, for
  inferring matched node pairs on different graphs across clients while maintaining
  privacy requirement, by leveraging graphlet theory and trust region optimization.
  First, the nodes’ graphlet features are captured to generate pseudo matched node
  pairs on different graphs across clients as pseudo training data for tackling the
  dilemma of unsupervised graph matching in federated setting and leveraging the strength
  of supervised graph matching. An approximate graphlet enumeration method is proposed
  to sample a small number of graphlets and capture nodes’ graphlet features. Theoretical
  analysis is conducted to demonstrate that the approximate method is able to maintain
  the quality of graphlet estimation while reducing its expensive cost. Second, we
  propose a separate trust region algorithm for pseudo supervised federated graph
  matching while maintaining the privacy constraints. In order to avoid expensive
  cost of the second-order Hessian computation in the trust region algorithm, we propose
  two weak quasi-Newton conditions to construct a positive definite scalar matrix
  as the Hessian approximation with only first-order gradients. We theoretically derive
  the error introduced by the separate trust region due to the Hessian approximation
  and conduct the convergence analysis of the approximation method.
