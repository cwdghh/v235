title: In-Context Freeze-Thaw Bayesian Optimization for Hyperparameter Optimization
openreview: VyoY3Wh9Wd
abstract: With the increasing computational costs associated with deep learning, automated
  hyperparameter optimization methods, strongly relying on black-box Bayesian optimization
  (BO), face limitations. Freeze-thaw BO offers a promising grey-box alternative,
  strategically allocating scarce resources incrementally to different configurations.
  However, the frequent surrogate model updates inherent to this approach pose challenges
  for existing methods, requiring retraining or fine-tuning their neural network surrogates
  online, introducing overhead, instability, and hyper-hyperparameters. In this work,
  we propose FT-PFN, a novel surrogate for Freeze-thaw style BO. FT-PFN is a prior-data
  fitted network (PFN) that leverages the transformersâ€™ in-context learning ability
  to efficiently and reliably do Bayesian learning curve extrapolation in a single
  forward pass. Our empirical analysis across three benchmark suites shows that the
  predictions made by FT-PFN are more accurate and 10-100 times faster than those
  of the deep Gaussian process and deep ensemble surrogates used in previous work.
  Furthermore, we show that, when combined with our novel acquisition mechanism (MFPI-random),
  the resulting in-context freeze-thaw BO method (ifBO), yields new state-of-the-art
  performance in the same three families of deep learning HPO benchmarks considered
  in prior work.
