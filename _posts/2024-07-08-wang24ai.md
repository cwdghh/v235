title: Highway Value Iteration Networks
openreview: rORsGuE2hV
abstract: 'Value iteration networks (VINs) enable end-to-end learning for planning
  tasks by employing a differentiable "planning module" that approximates the value
  iteration algorithm. However, long-term planning remains a challenge because training
  very deep VINs is difficult. To address this problem, we embed highway value iteration—a
  recent algorithm designed to facilitate long-term credit assignment—into the structure
  of VINs. This improvement augments the "planning module" of the VIN with three additional
  components: 1) an "aggregate gate," which constructs skip connections to improve
  information flow across many layers; 2) an "exploration module," crafted to increase
  the diversity of information and gradient flow in spatial dimensions; 3) a "filter
  gate" designed to ensure safe exploration. The resulting novel highway VIN can be
  trained effectively with hundreds of layers using standard backpropagation. In long-term
  planning tasks requiring hundreds of planning steps, deep highway VINs outperform
  both traditional VINs and several advanced, very deep NNs.'
