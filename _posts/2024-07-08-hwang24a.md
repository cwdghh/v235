title: On Positivity Condition for Causal Inference
openreview: 6D0nyemiWk
abstract: Identifying and estimating a causal effect is a fundamental task when researchers
  want to infer a causal effect using an observational study without experiments.
  A conventional assumption is the strict positivity of the given distribution, or
  so called positivity (or overlap) under the unconfounded assumption that the probabilities
  of treatments are positive. However, there exist many environments where neither
  observational data exhibits strict positivity nor unconfounded assumption holds.
  Against this background, we examine the graphical counterpart of the conventional
  positivity condition so as to license the use of identification formula without
  strict positivity. In particular, we explore various approaches, including analysis
  in a post-hoc manner, do-calculus, $Q$-decomposition, and algorithmic, to yielding
  a positivity condition for an identification formula, where we relate them, providing
  a comprehensive view. We further discuss the design of a positivity-aware identification
  algorithm based on the theoretical characterization of identification formulas.
