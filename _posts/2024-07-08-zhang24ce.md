title: Efficient Contextual Bandits with Uninformed Feedback Graphs
openreview: 0vozy8vstt
abstract: Bandits with feedback graphs are powerful online learning models that interpolate
  between the full information and classic bandit problems, capturing many real-life
  applications. A recent work by [Zhang et al., 2023] studies the contextual version
  of this problem and proposes an efficient and optimal algorithm via a reduction
  to online regression. However, their algorithm crucially relies on seeing the feedback
  graph before making each decision, while in many applications, the feedback graph
  is <em>uninformed</em>, meaning that it is either only revealed after the learner
  makes her decision or even never fully revealed at all. This work develops the first
  contextual algorithms for such uninformed settings, via an efficient reduction to
  online regression over both the losses and the graphs. Importantly, we show that
  it is critical to learn the graphs using <em>log loss</em> instead of squared loss
  to obtain favorable regret guarantees. We also demonstrate the empirical effectiveness
  of our algorithm on a bidding application using both synthetic and real-world data.
