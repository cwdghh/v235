title: Guidance with Spherical Gaussian Constraint for Conditional Diffusion
openreview: VtqyurB4Af
abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models attempt to handle conditional generative
  tasks by utilizing a differentiable loss function for guidance without the need
  for additional training. While these methods achieved certain success, they often
  compromise on sample quality and require small guidance step sizes, leading to longer
  sampling processes. This paper reveals that the fundamental issue lies in the manifold
  deviation during the sampling process when loss guidance is employed. We theoretically
  show the existence of manifold deviation by establishing a certain lower bound for
  the estimation error of the loss guidance. To mitigate this problem, we propose
  Diffusion with Spherical Gaussian constraint (DSG), drawing inspiration from the
  concentration phenomenon in high-dimensional Gaussian distributions. DSG effectively
  constrains the guidance step within the intermediate data manifold through optimization
  and enables the use of larger guidance steps. Furthermore, we present a closed-form
  solution for DSG denoising with the Spherical Gaussian constraint. Notably, DSG
  can seamlessly integrate as a plugin module within existing training-free conditional
  diffusion methods. Implementing DSG merely involves a few lines of additional code
  with almost no extra computational overhead, yet it leads to significant performance
  improvements. Comprehensive experimental results in various conditional generation
  tasks validate the superiority and adaptability of DSG in terms of both sample quality
  and time efficiency.
