title: 'Craftax: A Lightning-Fast Benchmark for Open-Ended Reinforcement Learning'
openreview: hg4wXlrQCV
abstract: 'Benchmarks play a crucial role in the development and analysis of reinforcement
  learning (RL) algorithms. We identify that existing benchmarks used for research
  into open-ended learning fall into one of two categories. Either they are too slow
  for meaningful research to be performed without enormous computational resources,
  like Crafter, NetHack and Minecraft, or they are not complex enough to pose a significant
  challenge, like Minigrid and Procgen. To remedy this, we first present Craftax-Classic:
  a ground-up rewrite of Crafter in JAX that runs up to 250x faster than the Python-native
  original. A run of PPO using 1 billion environment interactions finishes in under
  an hour using only a single GPU and averages 90% of the optimal reward. To provide
  a more compelling challenge we present the main Craftax benchmark, a significant
  extension of the Crafter mechanics with elements inspired from NetHack. Solving
  Craftax requires deep exploration, long term planning and memory, as well as continual
  adaptation to novel situations as more of the world is discovered. We show that
  existing methods including global and episodic exploration, as well as unsupervised
  environment design fail to make material progress on the benchmark. We therefore
  believe that Craftax can for the first time allow researchers to experiment in a
  complex, open-ended environment with limited computational resources.'
