title: 'Position: Topological Deep Learning is the New Frontier for Relational Learning'
openreview: Nl3RG5XWAt
abstract: Topological deep learning (TDL) is a rapidly evolving field that uses topological
  features to understand and design deep learning models. This paper posits that TDL
  is the new frontier for relational learning. TDL may complement graph representation
  learning and geometric deep learning by incorporating topological concepts, and
  can thus provide a natural choice for various machine learning settings. To this
  end, this paper discusses open problems in TDL, ranging from practical benefits
  to theoretical foundations. For each problem, it outlines potential solutions and
  future research opportunities. At the same time, this paper serves as an invitation
  to the scientific community to actively participate in TDL research to unlock the
  potential of this emerging field.
