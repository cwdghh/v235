title: 'BeigeMaps: Behavioral Eigenmaps for Reinforcement Learning from Images'
openreview: myCgfQZzbc
abstract: Training reinforcement learning (RL) agents directly from high-dimensional
  image observations continues to be a challenging problem. Recent line of work on
  behavioral distances proposes to learn representations that encode behavioral similarities
  quantified by the bisimulation metric. By learning an isometric mapping to a lower
  dimensional space that preserves this metric, such methods attempt to learn representations
  that group together functionally similar states. However, such an isometric mapping
  may not exist, making the learning objective ill-defined. We propose an alternative
  objective that allows distortions in long-range distances, while preserving <em>local</em>
  metric structure â€“ inducing representations that highlight natural clusters in the
  state space. This leads to new representations, which we term Behavioral Eigenmaps
  (BeigeMaps), corresponding to the eigenfunctions of similarity kernels induced by
  behavioral distances. We empirically demonstrate that when added as a drop-in modification,
  BeigeMaps improve the policy performance of prior behavioral distance based RL algorithms.
