title: A Human-Inspired Reading Agent with Gist Memory of Very Long Contexts
openreview: OTmcsyEO5G
abstract: 'Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are not only limited to some maximum
  context length, but also are not able to robustly consume long inputs. To address
  these limitations, we propose ReadAgent, an LLM agent system that increases effective
  context length up to 20x in our experiments. Inspired by how humans interactively
  read long documents, we implement ReadAgent as a simple prompting system that uses
  the advanced language capabilities of LLMs to (1) decide what content to store together
  in a memory episode, (2) compress those memory episodes into short episodic memories
  called <em>gist memories</em>, and (3) take actions to look up passages in the original
  text if ReadAgent needs to remind itself of relevant details to complete a task.
  We evaluate ReadAgent against baselines using retrieval methods, using the original
  long contexts, and using the gist memories. These evaluations are performed on three
  long-document reading comprehension tasks: QuALITY, NarrativeQA, and QMSum. ReadAgent
  outperforms the baselines on all three tasks while extending the effective context
  window by 3.5-20x.'
