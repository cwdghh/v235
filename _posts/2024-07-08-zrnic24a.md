title: Active Statistical Inference
openreview: GKMcCtWC7H
abstract: 'Inspired by the concept of active learning, we propose active inference—a
  methodology for statistical inference with machine-learning-assisted data collection.
  Assuming a budget on the number of labels that can be collected, the methodology
  uses a machine learning model to identify which data points would be most beneficial
  to label, thus effectively utilizing the budget. It operates on a simple yet powerful
  intuition: prioritize the collection of labels for data points where the model exhibits
  uncertainty, and rely on the model’s predictions where it is confident. Active inference
  constructs valid confidence intervals and hypothesis tests while leveraging any
  black-box machine learning model and handling any data distribution. The key point
  is that it achieves the same level of accuracy with far fewer samples than existing
  baselines relying on non-adaptively-collected data. This means that for the same
  number of collected samples, active inference enables smaller confidence intervals
  and more powerful tests. We evaluate active inference on datasets from public opinion
  research, census analysis, and proteomics.'
