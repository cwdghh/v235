title: How to Leverage Diverse Demonstrations in Offline Imitation Learning
openreview: oOlooUu2Sb
abstract: Offline Imitation Learning (IL) with imperfect demonstrations has garnered
  increasing attention owing to the scarcity of expert data in many real-world domains.
  A fundamental problem in this scenario is <em>how to extract positive behaviors
  from noisy data</em>. In general, current approaches to the problem select data
  building on state-action similarity to given expert demonstrations, neglecting precious
  information in (potentially abundant) <em>diverse</em> state-actions that deviate
  from expert ones. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective data selection
  method that identifies positive behaviors based on their <em>resultant states</em>
  - a more informative criterion enabling explicit utilization of dynamics information
  and effective extraction of both expert and beneficial diverse behaviors. Further,
  we devise a lightweight behavior cloning algorithm capable of leveraging the expert
  and selected data correctly. In the experiments, we evaluate our method on a suite
  of complex and high-dimensional offline IL benchmarks, including continuous-control
  and vision-based tasks. The results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
  performance, outperforming existing methods on <b>20/21</b> benchmarks, typically
  by <b>2-5x</b>, while maintaining a comparable runtime to Behavior Cloning (BC).
