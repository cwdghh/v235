title: Learning Useful Representations of Recurrent Neural Network Weight Matrices
openreview: QBj7Uurdwf
abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are general-purpose parallel-sequential
  computers. The program of an RNN is its weight matrix. How to learn useful representations
  of RNN weights that facilitate RNN analysis as well as downstream tasks? While the
  <em>mechanistic approach</em> directly looks at some RNN’s weights to predict its
  behavior, the <em>functionalist approach</em> analyzes its overall functionality–specifically,
  its input-output mapping. We consider several mechanistic approaches for RNN weights
  and adapt the permutation equivariant Deep Weight Space layer for RNNs. Our two
  novel functionalist approaches extract information from RNN weights by ’interrogating’
  the RNN through probing inputs. We develop a theoretical framework that demonstrates
  conditions under which the functionalist approach can generate rich representations
  that help determine RNN behavior. We create and release the first two ’model zoo’
  datasets for RNN weight representation learning. One consists of generative models
  of a class of formal languages, and the other one of classifiers of sequentially
  processed MNIST digits. With the help of an emulation-based self-supervised learning
  technique we compare and evaluate the different RNN weight encoding techniques on
  multiple downstream applications. On the most challenging one, namely predicting
  which exact task the RNN was trained on, functionalist approaches show clear superiority.
