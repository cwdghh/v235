title: Robust Learning-Augmented Dictionaries
openreview: XyhgssAo5b
abstract: We present the first learning-augmented data structure for implementing
  dictionaries with optimal consistency and robustness. Our data structure, named
  RobustSL, is a Skip list augmented by predictions of access frequencies of elements
  in a data sequence. With proper predictions, RobustSL has optimal consistency (achieves
  static optimality). At the same time, it maintains a logarithmic running time for
  each operation, ensuring optimal robustness, even if predictions are generated adversarially.
  Therefore, RobustSL has all the advantages of the recent learning-augmented data
  structures of Lin, Luo, and Woodruff (ICML 2022) and Cao et al. (arXiv 2023), while
  providing robustness guarantees that are absent in the previous work. Numerical
  experiments show that RobustSL outperforms alternative data structures using both
  synthetic and real datasets.
