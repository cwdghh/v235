title: 'LLM and Simulation as Bilevel Optimizers: A New Paradigm to Advance Physical
  Scientific Discovery'
openreview: hz8cFsdz7P
abstract: 'Large Language Models have recently gained significant attention in scientific
  discovery for their extensive knowledge and advanced reasoning capabilities. However,
  they encounter challenges in effectively simulating observational feedback and grounding
  it with language to propel advancements in physical scientific discovery. Conversely,
  human scientists undertake scientific discovery by formulating hypotheses, conducting
  experiments, and revising theories through observational analysis. Inspired by this,
  we propose to enhance the knowledge-driven, abstract reasoning abilities of LLMs
  with the computational strength of simulations. We introduce Scientific Generative
  Agent (SGA), a bilevel optimization framework: LLMs act as knowledgeable and versatile
  thinkers, proposing scientific hypotheses and reason about discrete components,
  such as physics equations or molecule structures; meanwhile, simulations function
  as experimental platforms, providing observational feedback and optimizing via differentiability
  for continuous parts, such as physical parameters. We conduct extensive experiments
  to demonstrate our frameworkâ€™s efficacy in constitutive law discovery and molecular
  design, unveiling novel solutions that differ from conventional human expectations
  yet remain coherent upon analysis.'
