title: An Information-Theoretic Analysis of In-Context Learning
openreview: NQn2tYLv5I
abstract: 'Previous theoretical results pertaining to meta-learning on sequences build
  on contrived and convoluted mixing time assumptions. We introduce new information-theoretic
  tools that lead to a concise yet general decomposition of error for a Bayes optimal
  predictor into two components: meta-learning error and intra-task error. These tools
  unify analyses across many meta-learning challenges. To illustrate, we apply them
  to establish new results about in-context learning with transformers and corroborate
  existing results a simple linear setting. Our theoretical results characterize how
  error decays in both the number of training sequences and sequence lengths. Our
  results are very general; for example, they avoid contrived mixing time assumptions
  made by all prior results that establish decay of error with sequence length.'
