title: An amortized approach to non-linear mixed-effects modeling based on neural
  posterior estimation
openreview: uCdcXRuHnC
abstract: 'Non-linear mixed-effects models are a powerful tool for studying heterogeneous
  populations in various fields, including biology, medicine, economics, and engineering.
  Here, the aim is to find a distribution over the parameters that describe the whole
  population using a model that can generate simulations for an individual of that
  population. However, fitting these distributions to data is computationally challenging
  if the description of individuals is complex and the population is large. To address
  this issue, we propose a novel machine learning-based approach: We exploit neural
  density estimation based on conditional normalizing flows to approximate individual-specific
  posterior distributions in an amortized fashion, thereby allowing for efficient
  inference of population parameters. Applying this approach to problems from cell
  biology and pharmacology, we demonstrate its unseen flexibility and scalability
  to large data sets compared to established methods.'
