title: The Non-linear $F$-Design and Applications to Interactive Learning
openreview: MMMHufVc2v
abstract: We propose a generalization of the classical G-optimal design concept to
  non-linear function classes. The criterion, termed F -design, coincides with G-design
  in the linear case. We compute the value of the optimal design, termed the F-condition
  number, for several non-linear function classes. We further provide algorithms to
  construct designs with a bounded F -condition number. Finally, we employ the F-design
  in a variety of interactive machine learning tasks, where the design is naturally
  useful for data collection or exploration. We show that in four diverse settings
  of confidence band construction, contextual bandits, model-free reinforcement learning,
  and active learning, F-design can be combined with existing approaches in a black-box
  manner to yield state-of-the-art results in known problem settings as well as to
  generalize to novel ones.
