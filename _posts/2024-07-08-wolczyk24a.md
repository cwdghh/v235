title: Fine-tuning Reinforcement Learning Models is Secretly a Forgetting Mitigation
  Problem
openreview: 53iSXb1m8w
abstract: 'Fine-tuning is a widespread technique that allows practitioners to transfer
  pre-trained capabilities, as recently showcased by the successful applications of
  foundation models. However, fine-tuning reinforcement learning (RL) models remains
  a challenge. This work conceptualizes one specific cause of poor transfer, accentuated
  in the RL setting by the interplay between actions and observations: <em>forgetting
  of pre-trained capabilities</em>. Namely, a model deteriorates on the state subspace
  of the downstream task not visited in the initial phase of fine-tuning, on which
  the model behaved well due to pre-training. This way, we lose the anticipated transfer
  benefits. We identify conditions when this problem occurs, showing that it is common
  and, in many cases, catastrophic. Through a detailed empirical analysis of the challenging
  NetHack and Montezuma’s Revenge environments, we show that standard knowledge retention
  techniques mitigate the problem and thus allow us to take full advantage of the
  pre-trained capabilities. In particular, in NetHack, we achieve a new state-of-the-art
  for neural models, improving the previous best score from $5$K to over $10$K points
  in the Human Monk scenario.'
