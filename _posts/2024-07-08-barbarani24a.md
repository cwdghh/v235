title: Scale-Free Image Keypoints Using Differentiable Persistent Homology
openreview: fNJbcxhxRj
abstract: In computer vision, keypoint detection is a fundamental task, with applications
  spanning from robotics to image retrieval; however, existing learning-based methods
  suffer from scale dependency, and lack flexibility. This paper introduces a novel
  approach that leverages Morse theory and persistent homology, powerful tools rooted
  in algebraic topology. We propose a novel loss function based on the recent introduction
  of a notion of subgradient in persistent homology, paving the way towards topological
  learning. Our detector, MorseDet, is the first topology-based learning model for
  feature detection, which achieves competitive performance in keypoint repeatability
  and introduces a principled and theoretically robust approach to the problem.
