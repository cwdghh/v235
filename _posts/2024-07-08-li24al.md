title: 'A Generative Approach for Treatment Effect Estimation under Collider Bias:
  From an Out-of-Distribution Perspective'
openreview: kUj9b2CezT
abstract: 'Resulting from non-random sample selection caused by both the treatment
  and outcome, collider bias poses a unique challenge to treatment effect estimation
  using observational data whose distribution differs from that of the target population.
  In this paper, we rethink collider bias from an out-of-distribution (OOD) perspective,
  considering that the entire data space of the target population consists of two
  different environments: The observational data selected from the target population
  belongs to a seen environment labeled with $S=1$ and the missing unselected data
  belongs to another unseen environment labeled with $S=0$. Based on this OOD formulation,
  we utilize small-scale representative data from the entire data space with no environmental
  labels and propose a novel method, i.e., Coupled Counterfactual Generative Adversarial
  Model (C$^2$GAM), to simultaneously generate the missing $S=0$ samples in observational
  data and the missing $S$ labels in the small-scale representative data. With the
  help of C$^2$GAM, collider bias can be addressed by combining the generated $S=0$
  samples and the observational data to estimate treatment effects. Extensive experiments
  on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that plugging C$^2$GAM into existing
  treatment effect estimators achieves significant performance improvements.'
