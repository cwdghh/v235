title: Improving fine-grained understanding in image-text pre-training
openreview: 5nxIRQ8GNa
abstract: We introduce SPARse fine-grained Contrastive alignment (SPARC), a simple
  method for pretraining more fine-grained multimodal representations from image-text
  pairs. Given that multiple image patches often correspond to single words, we propose
  to learn a grouping of image patches for every token in the caption. To achieve
  this, we use a sparse similarity metric between image patches and language tokens
  and compute for each token a language-grouped vision embedding as the weighted average
  of patches. The token and language-grouped vision embeddings are then contrasted
  through a fine-grained sequence-wise loss that only depends on individual samples
  and does not require other batch samples as negatives, i.e., more detailed information
  is encoded in a computationally inexpensive way. SPARC combines this fine-grained
  loss with a contrastive loss between global image and text embeddings to learn representations
  that simultaneously encode global and local information. We thoroughly evaluate
  SPARC and show improved performance over competing approaches both on image-level
  tasks relying on coarse-grained information, e.g. classification, as well as region-level
  tasks relying on fine-grained information, e.g., retrieval, object detection, segmentation
  while also improving model faithfulness and captioning in foundational vision-language
  models.
