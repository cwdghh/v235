title: 'CKGConv: General Graph Convolution with Continuous Kernels'
openreview: KgfGxXbjjE
abstract: The existing definitions of graph convolution, either from spatial or spectral
  perspectives, are inflexible and not unified. Defining a general convolution operator
  in the graph domain is challenging due to the lack of canonical coordinates, the
  presence of irregular structures, and the properties of graph symmetries. In this
  work, we propose a novel and general graph convolution framework by parameterizing
  the kernels as continuous functions of pseudo-coordinates derived via graph positional
  encoding. We name this Continuous Kernel Graph Convolution (CKGConv). Theoretically,
  we demonstrate that CKGConv is flexible and expressive. CKGConv encompasses many
  existing graph convolutions, and exhibits a stronger expressiveness, as powerful
  as graph transformers in terms of distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs. Empirically,
  we show that CKGConv-based Networks outperform existing graph convolutional networks
  and perform comparably to the best graph transformers across a variety of graph
  datasets. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/networkslab/CKGConv.
