title: 'Two-Stage Shadow Inclusion Estimation: An IV Approach for Causal Inference
  under Latent Confounding and Collider Bias'
openreview: YRWdiaupCr
abstract: Latent confounding bias and collider bias are two key challenges of causal
  inference in observational studies. Latent confounding bias occurs when failing
  to control the unmeasured covariates that are common causes of treatments and outcomes,
  which can be addressed by using the Instrumental Variable (IV) approach. Collider
  bias comes from non-random sample selection caused by both treatments and outcomes,
  which can be addressed by using a different type of instruments, i.e., shadow variables.
  However, in most scenarios, these two biases simultaneously exist in observational
  data, and the previous methods focusing on either one are inadequate. To the best
  of our knowledge, no approach has been developed for causal inference when both
  biases exist. In this paper, we propose a novel IV approach, Two-Stage Shadow Inclusion
  (2SSI), which can simultaneously address latent confounding bias and collider bias
  by utilizing the residual of the treatment as a shadow variable. Extensive experimental
  results on benchmark synthetic datasets and a real-world dataset show that 2SSI
  achieves noticeable performance improvement when both biases exist compared to existing
  methods.
