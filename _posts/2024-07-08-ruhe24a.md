title: Rolling Diffusion Models
openreview: a9bzTv9SzO
abstract: 'Diffusion models have recently been increasingly applied to temporal data
  such as video, fluid mechanics simulations, or climate data. These methods generally
  treat subsequent frames equally regarding the amount of noise in the diffusion process.
  This paper explores Rolling Diffusion: a new approach that uses a sliding window
  denoising process. It ensures that the diffusion process progressively corrupts
  through time by assigning more noise to frames that appear later in a sequence,
  reflecting greater uncertainty about the future as the generation process unfolds.
  Empirically, we show that when the temporal dynamics are complex, Rolling Diffusion
  is superior to standard diffusion. In particular, this result is demonstrated in
  a video prediction task using the Kinetics-600 video dataset and in a chaotic fluid
  dynamics forecasting experiment.'
