title: 'DsDm: Model-Aware Dataset Selection with Datamodels'
openreview: GC8HkKeH8s
abstract: 'When selecting data for training large-scale models, standard practice
  is to filter for examples that match human notions of data quality. Such filtering
  yields qualitatively clean datapoints that intuitively should improve model behavior.
  However, in practice the opposite can often happen: we find that selecting according
  to similarity with "high quality" data sources may not increase (and can even hurt)
  performance compared to randomly selecting data. To develop better methods for selecting
  data, we start by framing dataset selection as an optimization problem that we can
  directly solve for: given target tasks, a learning algorithm, and candidate data,
  select the subset that maximizes model performance. This framework thus avoids handpicked
  notions of data quality, and instead models explicitly how the learning process
  uses train datapoints to predict on the target tasks. Our resulting method greatly
  improves language model (LM) performance on both pre-specified tasks and previously
  unseen tasks. Specifically, choosing target tasks representative of standard LM
  problems and evaluating on diverse held-out benchmarks, our selected datasets provide
  a 2x compute multiplier over baseline methods.'
