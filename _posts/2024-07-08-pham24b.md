title: Cross-view Masked Diffusion Transformers for Person Image Synthesis
openreview: jEoIkNkqyc
abstract: 'We present X-MDPT ($\underline{Cross}$-view $\underline{M}$asked $\underline{D}$iffusion
  $\underline{P}$rediction $\underline{T}$ransformers), a novel diffusion model designed
  for pose-guided human image generation. X-MDPT distinguishes itself by employing
  masked diffusion transformers that operate on latent patches, a departure from the
  commonly-used Unet structures in existing works. The model comprises three key modules:
  1) a denoising diffusion Transformer, 2) an aggregation network that consolidates
  conditions into a single vector for the diffusion process, and 3) a mask cross-prediction
  module that enhances representation learning with semantic information from the
  reference image. X-MDPT demonstrates scalability, improving FID, SSIM, and LPIPS
  with larger models. Despite its simple design, our model outperforms state-of-the-art
  approaches on the DeepFashion dataset while exhibiting efficiency in terms of training
  parameters, training time, and inference speed. Our compact 33MB model achieves
  an FID of 7.42, surpassing a prior Unet latent diffusion approach (FID 8.07) using
  only $11\times$ fewer parameters. Our best model surpasses the pixel-based diffusion
  with $\frac{2}{3}$ of the parameters and achieves $5.43 \times$ faster inference.
