title: Winner-takes-all learners are geometry-aware conditional density estimators
openreview: SAbL40d8A4
abstract: Winner-takes-all training is a simple learning paradigm, which handles ambiguous
  tasks by predicting a set of plausible hypotheses. Recently, a connection was established
  between Winner-takes-all training and centroidal Voronoi tessellations, showing
  that, once trained, hypotheses should quantize optimally the shape of the conditional
  distribution to predict. However, the best use of these hypotheses for uncertainty
  quantification is still an open question. In this work, we show how to leverage
  the appealing geometric properties of the Winner-takes-all learners for conditional
  density estimation, without modifying its original training scheme. We theoretically
  establish the advantages of our novel estimator both in terms of quantization and
  density estimation, and we demonstrate its competitiveness on synthetic and real-world
  datasets, including audio data.
