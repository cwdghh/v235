title: Implicit Representations for Constrained Image Segmentation
openreview: IaV6AgrTUp
abstract: Implicit representations allow to use a parametric function that maps (spatial)
  coordinates to the value that is traditionally stored in each pixel, e.g. RGB values,
  instead of a discrete grid. This has recently proven quite advantageous as an internal
  representation for images or scenes for deep learning models. Yet, its potential
  to ensure certain properties of the solution has not yet been fully explored. In
  this work, we demonstrate that implicit representations are a powerful tool for
  enforcing a variety of different geometric constraints in image segmentation. While
  convexity, star-shape, path-connectedness, periodicity, or symmetry of the (spatial
  or space-time) region to be segmented are very challenging to enforce for pixel-wise
  discretizations, a suitable parametrization of an implicit representation, mapping
  spatial or spatio-temporal coordinates to the likeliness of a pixel belonging to
  the fore- or background, allows to <b>provably</b> ensure such constraints. Several
  numerical examples demonstrate that challenging segmentation scenarios can benefit
  from the inclusion of application-specific constraints, e.g. when occlusions prevent
  a faithful segmentation with classical approaches.
