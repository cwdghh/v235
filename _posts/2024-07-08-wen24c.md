title: Diffusion-based Missing-view Generation With the Application on Incomplete
  Multi-view Clustering
openreview: OHFxcU9jwW
abstract: As a branch of clustering, multi-view clustering has received much attention
  in recent years. In practical applications, a common phenomenon is that partial
  views of some samples may be missing in the collected multi-view data, which poses
  a severe challenge to design the multi-view learning model and explore complementary
  and consistent information. Currently, most of the incomplete multi-view clustering
  methods only focus on exploring the information of available views while few works
  study the missing view recovery for incomplete multi-view learning. To this end,
  we propose an innovative diffusion-based missing view generation (DMVG) network.
  Moreover, for the scenarios with high missing rates, we further propose an incomplete
  multi-view data augmentation strategy to enhance the recovery quality for the missing
  views. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed DMVG can not only accurately
  predict missing views, but also further enhance the subsequent clustering performance
  in comparison with several state-of-the-art incomplete multi-view clustering methods.
