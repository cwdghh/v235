title: Accelerating Convergence of Score-Based Diffusion Models, Provably
openreview: KB6slOUQP9
abstract: Score-based diffusion models, while achieving remarkable empirical performance,
  often suffer from low sampling speed, due to extensive function evaluations needed
  during the sampling phase. Despite a flurry of recent activities towards speeding
  up diffusion generative modeling in practice, theoretical underpinnings for acceleration
  techniques remain severely limited. In this paper, we design novel training-free
  algorithms to accelerate popular deterministic (i.e., DDIM) and stochastic (i.e.,
  DDPM) samplers. Our accelerated deterministic sampler converges at a rate $O(\frac{1}{{T}^2})$
  with $T$ the number of steps, improving upon the $O(\frac{1}{T})$ rate for the DDIM
  sampler; and our accelerated stochastic sampler converges at a rate $O(\frac{1}{T})$,
  outperforming the rate $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{T}})$ for the DDPM sampler. The design
  of our algorithms leverages insights from higher-order approximation, and shares
  similar intuitions as popular high-order ODE solvers like the DPM-Solver-2. Our
  theory accommodates $\ell_2$-accurate score estimates, and does not require log-concavity
  or smoothness on the target distribution.
