title: Sparse and Structured Hopfield Networks
openreview: OdPlFWExX1
abstract: Modern Hopfield networks have enjoyed recent interest due to their connection
  to attention in transformers. Our paper provides a unified framework for sparse
  Hopfield networks by establishing a link with Fenchel-Young losses. The result is
  a new family of Hopfield-Fenchel-Young energies whose update rules are end-to-end
  differentiable sparse transformations. We reveal a connection between loss margins,
  sparsity, and exact memory retrieval. We further extend this framework to structured
  Hopfield networks via the SparseMAP transformation, which can retrieve pattern associations
  instead of a single pattern. Experiments on multiple instance learning and text
  rationalization demonstrate the usefulness of our approach.
