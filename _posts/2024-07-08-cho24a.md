title: 'Peeking with PEAK: Sequential, Nonparametric Composite Hypothesis Tests for
  Means of Multiple Data Streams'
openreview: hcASxFvmZ5
abstract: 'We propose a novel nonparametric sequential test for composite hypotheses
  for means of multiple data streams. Our proposed method, peeking with expectation-based
  averaged capital (PEAK), builds upon the testing-by-betting framework and provides
  a non-asymptotic $\alpha$-level test across any stopping time. Our contributions
  are two-fold: (1) we propose a novel betting scheme and provide theoretical guarantees
  on type-I error control, power, and asymptotic growth rate/$e$-power in the setting
  of a single data stream; (2) we introduce PEAK, a generalization of this betting
  scheme to multiple streams, that (i) avoids using wasteful union bounds via averaging,
  (ii) is a test of power one under mild regularity conditions on the sampling scheme
  of the streams, and (iii) reduces computational overhead when applying the testing-as-betting
  approaches for pure-exploration bandit problems. We illustrate the practical benefits
  of PEAK using both synthetic and real-world HeartSteps datasets. Our experiments
  show that PEAK provides up to an 85% reduction in the number of samples before stopping
  compared to existing stopping rules for pure-exploration bandit problems, and matches
  the performance of state-of-the-art sequential tests while improving upon computational
  complexity.'
