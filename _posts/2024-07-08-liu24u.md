title: Unlock the Cognitive Generalization of Deep Reinforcement Learning via Granular
  Ball Representation
openreview: CtyLla0DU8
abstract: The policies learned by humans in simple scenarios can be deployed in complex
  scenarios with the same task logic through limited feature alignment training, a
  process referred to as cognitive generalization or systematic generalization. Thus,
  a plausible conjecture is that unlocking cognitive generalization in DRL could enable
  effective generalization of policies from simple to complex scenarios through reward-agnostic
  fine-tuning. This would eliminate the need for designing reward functions in complex
  scenarios, thus reducing environment-building costs. In this paper, we propose a
  general framework to enhance the cognitive generalization ability of standard DRL
  methods. Our framework builds a cognitive latent space in a simple scenario, then
  segments the latent space to cluster samples with similar environmental influences
  into same subregion. During the fine-tuning in the complex scenario, the policy
  uses cognitive latent space to align the new sample with the same subregion sample
  collected from the simple scenario and approximates the rewards and Q values of
  the new samples for policy update. Based on this framework, we propose <em>Granular
  Ball Reinforcement Leaning</em> (GBRL), a practical algorithm via Variational Autoencoder
  (VAE) and Granular Ball Representation. GBRL achieves effective policy generalization
  on various difficult scenarios with the same task logic.
