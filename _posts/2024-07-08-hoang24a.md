title: Learning Surrogates for Offline Black-Box Optimization via Gradient Matching
openreview: mv9beA1wDF
abstract: Offline design optimization problem arises in numerous science and engineering
  applications including material and chemical design, where expensive online experimentation
  necessitates the use of <em>in silico</em> surrogate functions to predict and maximize
  the target objective over candidate designs. Although these surrogates can be learned
  from offline data, their predictions are often inaccurate outside the offline data
  regime. This challenge raises a fundamental question about the impact of imperfect
  surrogate model on the performance gap between its optima and the true optima, and
  to what extent the performance loss can be mitigated. Although prior work developed
  methods to improve the robustness of surrogate models and their associated optimization
  processes, a provably quantifiable relationship between an imperfect surrogate and
  the corresponding performance gap, as well as whether prior methods directly address
  it, remain elusive. To shed light on this important question, we present a theoretical
  framework to understand offline black-box optimization, by explicitly bounding the
  optimization quality based on how well the surrogate matches the latent gradient
  field that underlines the offline data. Inspired by our theoretical analysis, we
  propose a principled black-box gradient matching algorithm to create effective surrogate
  models for offline optimization, improving over prior approaches on various real-world
  benchmarks.
