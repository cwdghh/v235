title: Hyperbolic Geometric Latent Diffusion Model for Graph Generation
openreview: 6OkvBGqW62
abstract: Diffusion models have made significant contributions to computer vision,
  sparking a growing interest in the community recently regarding the application
  of it to graph generation. The existing discrete graph diffusion models exhibit
  heightened computational complexity and diminished training efficiency. A preferable
  and natural way is to directly diffuse the graph within the latent space. However,
  due to the non-Euclidean structure of graphs is not isotropic in the latent space,
  the existing latent diffusion models effectively make it difficult to capture and
  preserve the topological information of graphs. To address the above challenges,
  we propose a novel geometrically latent diffusion framework HypDiff. Specifically,
  we first establish a geometrically latent space with interpretability measures based
  on hyperbolic geometry, to define anisotropic latent diffusion processes for graphs.
  Then, we propose a geometrically latent diffusion process that is constrained by
  both radial and angular geometric properties, thereby ensuring the preservation
  of the original topological properties in the generative graphs. Extensive experimental
  results demonstrate the superior effectiveness of HypDiff for graph generation with
  various topologies.
