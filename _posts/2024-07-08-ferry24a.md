title: Trained Random Forests Completely Reveal your Dataset
openreview: cc72Vnfvoc
abstract: We introduce an optimization-based reconstruction attack capable of completely
  or near-completely reconstructing a dataset utilized for training a random forest.
  Notably, our approach relies solely on information readily available in commonly
  used libraries such as scikit-learn. To achieve this, we formulate the reconstruction
  problem as a combinatorial problem under a maximum likelihood objective. We demonstrate
  that this problem is NP-hard, though solvable at scale using constraint programming
  - an approach rooted in constraint propagation and solution-domain reduction. Through
  an extensive computational investigation, we demonstrate that random forests trained
  without bootstrap aggregation but with feature randomization are susceptible to
  a complete reconstruction. This holds true even with a small number of trees. Even
  with bootstrap aggregation, the majority of the data can also be reconstructed.
  These findings underscore a critical vulnerability inherent in widely adopted ensemble
  methods, warranting attention and mitigation. Although the potential for such reconstruction
  attacks has been discussed in privacy research, our study provides clear empirical
  evidence of their practicability.
