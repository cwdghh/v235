title: Linguistic Calibration of Long-Form Generations
openreview: rJVjQSQ8ye
abstract: 'Language models (LMs) may lead their users to make suboptimal downstream
  decisions when they confidently hallucinate. This issue can be mitigated by having
  the LM verbally convey the probability that its claims are correct, but existing
  models cannot produce long-form text with calibrated confidence statements. Through
  the lens of decision-making, we define linguistic calibration for long-form generations:
  an LM is linguistically calibrated if its generations enable its users to make calibrated
  probabilistic predictions. This definition enables a training framework where a
  supervised finetuning step bootstraps an LM to emit long-form generations with confidence
  statements such as "I estimate a 30% chance of..." or "I am certain that...", followed
  by a reinforcement learning step which rewards generations that enable a user to
  provide calibrated answers to related questions. We linguistically calibrate Llama
  2 7B and find in automated and human evaluations of long-form generations that it
  is significantly more calibrated than strong finetuned factuality baselines with
  comparable accuracy. These findings generalize under significant domain shifts to
  scientific and biomedical questions and to an entirely held-out person biography
  generation task. Our results demonstrate that long-form generations may be calibrated
  end-to-end by constructing an objective in the space of the predictions that users
  make in downstream decision-making.'
