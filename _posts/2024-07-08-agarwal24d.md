title: 'Improved Differentially Private and Lazy Online Convex Optimization: Lower
  Regret without Smoothness Requirements'
openreview: xl2yU3dsHK
abstract: We design differentially private regret-minimizing algorithms in the online
  convex optimization (OCO) framework. Unlike recent results, our algorithms and analyses
  do not require smoothness, thus yielding the first private regret bounds with an
  optimal leading-order term for non-smooth loss functions. Additionally, even for
  smooth losses, the resulting regret guarantees improve upon previous results in
  terms their dependence of dimension. Our results provide the best known rates for
  DP-OCO in all practical regimes of the privacy parameter, barring when it is exceptionally
  small. The principal innovation in our algorithm design is the use of sampling from
  strongly log-concave densities which satisfy the Log-Sobolev Inequality. The resulting
  concentration of measure allows us to obtain a better trade-off for the dimension
  factors than prior work, leading to improved results. Following previous works on
  DP-OCO, the proposed algorithm explicitly limits the number of switches via rejection
  sampling. Thus, independently of privacy constraints, the algorithm also provides
  improved results for online convex optimization with a switching budget.
