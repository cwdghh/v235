title: Cross-domain Open-world Discovery
openreview: WofwaWjIf7
abstract: In many real-world applications, test data may commonly exhibit categorical
  shifts, characterized by the emergence of novel classes, as well as distribution
  shifts arising from feature distributions different from the ones the model was
  trained on. However, existing methods either discover novel classes in the open-world
  setting or assume domain shifts without the ability to discover novel classes. In
  this work, we consider a cross-domain open-world discovery setting, where the goal
  is to assign samples to seen classes and discover unseen classes under a domain
  shift. To address this challenging problem, we present CROW, a prototype-based approach
  that introduces a cluster-then-match strategy enabled by a well-structured representation
  space of foundation models. In this way, CROW discovers novel classes by robustly
  matching clusters with previously seen classes, followed by fine-tuning the representation
  space using an objective designed for cross-domain open-world discovery. Extensive
  experimental results on image classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that
  CROW outperforms alternative baselines, achieving an 8% average performance improvement
  across 75 experimental settings.
