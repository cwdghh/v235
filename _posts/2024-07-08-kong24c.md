title: 'ELF: Encoding Speaker-Specific Latent Speech Feature for Speech Synthesis'
openreview: Ug1m4P4AKf
abstract: In this work, we propose a novel method for modeling numerous speakers,
  which enables expressing the overall characteristics of speakers in detail like
  a trained multi-speaker model without additional training on the target speaker’s
  dataset. Although various works with similar purposes have been actively studied,
  their performance has not yet reached that of trained multi-speaker models due to
  their fundamental limitations. To overcome previous limitations, we propose effective
  methods for feature learning and representing target speakers’ speech characteristics
  by discretizing the features and conditioning them to a speech synthesis model.
  Our method obtained a significantly higher similarity mean opinion score (SMOS)
  in subjective similarity evaluation than seen speakers of a high-performance multi-speaker
  model, even with unseen speakers. The proposed method also outperforms a zero-shot
  method by significant margins. Furthermore, our method shows remarkable performance
  in generating new artificial speakers. In addition, we demonstrate that the encoded
  latent features are sufficiently informative to reconstruct an original speaker’s
  speech completely. It implies that our method can be used as a general methodology
  to encode and reconstruct speakers’ characteristics in various tasks.
