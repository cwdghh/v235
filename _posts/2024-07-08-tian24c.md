title: Liouville Flow Importance Sampler
openreview: OMKNBzf6HJ
abstract: We present the Liouville Flow Importance Sampler (LFIS), an innovative flow-based
  model for generating samples from unnormalized density functions. LFIS learns a
  time-dependent velocity field that deterministically transports samples from a simple
  initial distribution to a complex target distribution, guided by a prescribed path
  of annealed distributions. The training of LFIS utilizes a unique method that enforces
  the structure of a derived partial differential equation to neural networks modeling
  velocity fields. By considering the neural velocity field as an importance sampler,
  sample weights can be computed through accumulating errors along the sample trajectories
  driven by neural velocity fields, ensuring unbiased and consistent estimation of
  statistical quantities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LFIS through its application
  to a range of benchmark problems, on many of which LFIS achieved state-of-the-art
  performance.
