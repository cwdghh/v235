title: 'Model Tailor: Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Multi-modal Large Language
  Models'
openreview: piujJIF3zs
abstract: Catastrophic forgetting emerges as a critical challenge when fine-tuning
  multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), where improving performance on unseen
  tasks often leads to a significant performance drop on the original tasks. This
  paper presents a comprehensive analysis of catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs and
  introduces a post-training adjustment method called Model Tailor. Our method primarily
  preserves the pre-trained parameters while replacing a small number ($\leq$ 10%)
  of fine-tuned parameters, maintaining $\sim$ 99% effectiveness on original tasks
  versus pre-training, and achieving $\sim$ 97% on new tasks compared to standard
  fine-tuning. Specifically, we derive a sparse mask to identify the model patch,
  based on a fusion strategy that integrates salience and sensitivity analysis. Subsequently,
  a compensation mechanism is introduced to decorate the patch, enhancing the modelâ€™s
  performance on both target and original tasks. Additionally, our method is adaptable
  to multi-task scenarios. Through extensive experiments on InstructBLIP and LLaVA-1.5
  in both image captioning and visual question answering tasks, our approach demonstrates
  significant task adaptability while preserving inherent pre-trained capabilities.
