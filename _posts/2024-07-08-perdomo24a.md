title: The Relative Value of Prediction in Algorithmic Decision Making
openreview: oaACFfNbXl
abstract: 'Algorithmic predictions are increasingly used to inform the allocations
  of goods and interventions in the public sphere. In these domains, predictions serve
  as a means to an end. They provide stakeholders with insights into likelihood of
  future events as a means to improve decision making quality, and enhance social
  welfare. However, if maximizing welfare is the ultimate goal, prediction is only
  a small piece of the puzzle. There are various other policy levers a social planner
  might pursue in order to improve bottom-line outcomes, such as expanding access
  to available goods, or increasing the effect sizes of interventions. Given this
  broad range of design decisions, a basic question to ask is: What is the relative
  value of prediction in algorithmic decision making? How do the improvements in welfare
  arising from better predictions compare to those of other policy levers? The goal
  of our work is to initiate the formal study of these questions. Our main results
  are theoretical in nature. We identify simple, sharp conditions determining the
  relative value of prediction vis-Ã -vis expanding access, within several statistical
  models that are popular amongst quantitative social scientists. Furthermore, we
  illustrate how these theoretical insights can guide the design of algorithmic decision
  making systems in practice.'
