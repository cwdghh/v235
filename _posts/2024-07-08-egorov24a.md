title: 'Ai-sampler: Adversarial Learning of Markov kernels with involutive maps'
openreview: xFCA2yWVs4
abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have become popular in statistics as versatile
  techniques to sample from complicated probability distributions. In this work, we
  propose a method to parameterize and train transition kernels of Markov chains to
  achieve efficient sampling and good mixing. This training procedure minimizes the
  total variation distance between the stationary distribution of the chain and the
  empirical distribution of the data. Our approach leverages involutive Metropolis-Hastings
  kernels constructed from reversible neural networks that ensure detailed balance
  by construction. We find that reversibility also implies $C_2$-equivariance of the
  discriminator function which can be used to restrict its function space.
