title: Stable Differentiable Causal Discovery
openreview: JJZBZW28Gn
abstract: 'Inferring causal relationships as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) is an
  important but challenging problem. Differentiable Causal Discovery (DCD) is a promising
  approach to this problem, framing the search as a continuous optimization. But existing
  DCD methods are numerically unstable, with poor performance beyond tens of variables.
  In this paper, we propose Stable Differentiable Causal Discovery (SDCD), a new method
  that improves previous DCD methods in two ways: (1) It employs an alternative constraint
  for acyclicity; this constraint is more stable, both theoretically and empirically,
  and fast to compute. (2) It uses a training procedure tailored for sparse causal
  graphs, which are common in real-world scenarios. We first derive SDCD and prove
  its stability and correctness. We then evaluate it with both observational and interventional
  data and in both small-scale and large-scale settings. We find that SDCD outperforms
  existing methods in convergence speed and accuracy, and can scale to thousands of
  variables.'
