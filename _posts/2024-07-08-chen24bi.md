title: 'HALC: Object Hallucination Reduction via Adaptive Focal-Contrast Decoding'
openreview: EYvEVbfoDp
abstract: While large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive
  capabilities in interpreting multi-modal contexts, they invariably suffer from object
  hallucinations (OH). We introduce HALC, a novel decoding algorithm designed to mitigate
  OH in LVLMs. HALC leverages distinct fine-grained optimal visual information in
  vision-language tasks and operates on both local and global contexts simultaneously.
  Specifically, HALC integrates a robust auto-focal grounding mechanism (locally)
  to correct hallucinated tokens on the fly, and a specialized beam search algorithm
  (globally) to significantly reduce OH while preserving text generation quality.
  Additionally, HALC can be integrated into any LVLMs as a plug-and-play module without
  extra training. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate HALCâ€™s effectiveness
  in reducing OH, outperforming state-of-the-arts across four benchmarks. Code is
  released at https://github.com/BillChan226/HALC.
