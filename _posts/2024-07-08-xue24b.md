title: Offline Multi-Objective Optimization
openreview: 3AuoStfUIH
abstract: Offline optimization aims to maximize a black-box objective function with
  a static dataset and has wide applications. In addition to the objective function
  being black-box and expensive to evaluate, numerous complex real-world problems
  entail optimizing multiple conflicting objectives, i.e., multi-objective optimization
  (MOO). Nevertheless, offline MOO has not progressed as much as offline single-objective
  optimization (SOO), mainly due to the lack of benchmarks like Design-Bench for SOO.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a first benchmark for offline MOO, covering a range
  of problems from synthetic to real-world tasks. This benchmark provides tasks, datasets,
  and open-source examples, which can serve as a foundation for method comparisons
  and advancements in offline MOO. Furthermore, we analyze how the current related
  methods can be adapted to offline MOO from four fundamental perspectives, including
  data, model architecture, learning algorithm, and search algorithm. Empirical results
  show improvements over the best value of the training set, demonstrating the effectiveness
  of offline MOO methods. As no particular method stands out significantly, there
  is still an open challenge in further enhancing the effectiveness of offline MOO.
  We finally discuss future challenges for offline MOO, with the hope of shedding
  some light on this emerging field. Our code is available at https://github.com/lamda-bbo/offline-moo.
