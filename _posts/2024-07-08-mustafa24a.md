title: 'GATE: How to Keep Out Intrusive Neighbors'
openreview: Sjv5RcqfuH
abstract: 'Graph Attention Networks (GATs) are designed to provide flexible neighborhood
  aggregation that assigns weights to neighbors according to their importance. In
  practice, however, GATs are often unable to switch off task-irrelevant neighborhood
  aggregation, as we show experimentally and analytically. To address this challenge,
  we propose GATE, a GAT extension that holds three major advantages: i) It alleviates
  over-smoothing by addressing its root cause of unnecessary neighborhood aggregation.
  ii) Similarly to perceptrons, it benefits from higher depth as it can still utilize
  additional layers for (non-)linear feature transformations in case of (nearly) switched-off
  neighborhood aggregation. iii) By down-weighting connections to unrelated neighbors,
  it often outperforms GATs on real-world heterophilic datasets. To further validate
  our claims, we construct a synthetic test bed to analyze a modelâ€™s ability to utilize
  the appropriate amount of neighborhood aggregation, which could be of independent
  interest.'
