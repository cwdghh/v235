title: 'Agent Smith: A Single Image Can Jailbreak One Million Multimodal LLM Agents
  Exponentially Fast'
openreview: DYMj03Gbri
abstract: A multimodal large language model (MLLM) agent can receive instructions,
  capture images, retrieve histories from memory, and decide which tools to use. Nonetheless,
  red-teaming efforts have revealed that adversarial images/prompts can jailbreak
  an MLLM and cause unaligned behaviors. In this work, we report an even more severe
  safety issue in multi-agent environments, referred to as infectious jailbreak. It
  entails the adversary simply jailbreaking a single agent, and without any further
  intervention from the adversary, (almost) all agents will become infected exponentially
  fast and exhibit harmful behaviors. To validate the feasibility of infectious jailbreak,
  we simulate multi-agent environments containing up to one million LLaVA-1.5 agents,
  and employ randomized pair-wise chat as a proof-of-concept instantiation for multi-agent
  interaction. Our results show that feeding an (infectious) adversarial image into
  the memory of any randomly chosen agent is sufficient to achieve infectious jailbreak.
  Finally, we derive a simple principle for determining whether a defense mechanism
  can provably restrain the spread of infectious jailbreak, but how to design a practical
  defense that meets this principle remains an open question to investigate.
