title: Explorations of Self-Repair in Language Models
openreview: 5ZwEifshyo
abstract: Prior interpretability research studying narrow distributions has preliminarily
  identified self-repair, a phenomena where if components in large language models
  are ablated, later components will change their behavior to compensate. Our work
  builds off this past literature, demonstrating that self-repair exists on a variety
  of models families and sizes when ablating individual attention heads on the full
  training distribution. We further show that on the full training distribution self-repair
  is imperfect, as the original direct effect of the head is not fully restored, and
  noisy, since the degree of self-repair varies significantly across different prompts
  (sometimes overcorrecting beyond the original effect). We highlight two different
  mechanisms that contribute to self-repair, including changes in the final LayerNorm
  scaling factor and sparse sets of neurons implementing Anti-Erasure. We additionally
  discuss the implications of these results for interpretability practitioners and
  close with a more speculative discussion on the mystery of why self-repair occurs
  in these models at all, highlighting evidence for the Iterative Inference hypothesis
  in language models, a framework that predicts self-repair.
