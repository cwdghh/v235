title: 'Spotting LLMs With Binoculars: Zero-Shot Detection of Machine-Generated Text'
openreview: axl3FAkpik
abstract: Detecting text generated by modern large language models is thought to be
  hard, as both LLMs and humans can exhibit a wide range of complex behaviors. However,
  we find that a score based on contrasting two closely related language models is
  highly accurate at separating human-generated and machine-generated text. Based
  on this mechanism, we propose a novel LLM detector that only requires simple calculations
  using a pair of pre-trained LLMs. The method, called <em>Binoculars</em>, achieves
  state-of-the-art accuracy without any training data. It is capable of spotting machine
  text from a range of modern LLMs without any model-specific modifications. We comprehensively
  evaluate <em>Binoculars</em> on a number of text sources and in varied situations.
  Over a wide range of document types, <em>Binoculars</em> detects over 90% of generated
  samples from ChatGPT (and other LLMs) at a false positive rate of 0.01%, despite
  not being trained on any ChatGPT data. Code available at https://github.com/ahans30/Binoculars.
