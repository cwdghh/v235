title: Learning Optimal Projection for Forecast Reconciliation of Hierarchical Time
  Series
openreview: 55HfvJ6lDB
abstract: Hierarchical time series forecasting requires not only prediction accuracy
  but also coherency, i.e., forecasts add up appropriately across the hierarchy. Recent
  literature has shown that reconciliation via projection outperforms prior methods
  such as top-down or bottom-up approaches. Unlike existing work that pre-specifies
  a projection matrix (e.g., orthogonal), we study the problem of learning the optimal
  oblique projection from data for coherent forecasting of hierarchical time series.
  In addition to the unbiasedness-preserving property, oblique projection implicitly
  accounts for the hierarchy structure and assigns different weights to individual
  time series, providing significant adaptability over orthogonal projection which
  treats base forecast errors equally. We examine two broad classes of projections,
  namely Euclidean projection and general oblique projections. We propose to model
  the reconciliation step as a learnable, structured, projection layer in the neural
  forecaster architecture. The proposed approach allows for the efficient learning
  of the optimal projection in an end-to-end framework where both the neural forecaster
  and the projection layer are learned simultaneously. An empirical evaluation of
  real-world hierarchical time series datasets demonstrates the superior performance
  of the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art approaches.
