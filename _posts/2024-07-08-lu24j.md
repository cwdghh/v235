title: 'NeWRF: A Deep Learning Framework for Wireless Radiation Field Reconstruction
  and Channel Prediction'
openreview: 181hXof7ho
abstract: We present NeWRF, a novel deep-learning-based framework for predicting wireless
  channels. Wireless channel prediction is a long-standing problem in the wireless
  community and is a key technology for improving the coverage of wireless network
  deployments. Today, a wireless deployment is evaluated by a site survey which is
  a cumbersome process requiring an experienced engineer to perform extensive channel
  measurements. To reduce the cost of site surveys, we develop NeWRF, which is based
  on recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). NeWRF trains a neural network
  model with a sparse set of channel measurements, and predicts the wireless channel
  accurately at any location in the site. We introduce a series of techniques that
  integrate wireless propagation properties into the NeRF framework to account for
  the fundamental differences between the behavior of light and wireless signals.
  We conduct extensive evaluations of our framework and show that our approach can
  accurately predict channels at unvisited locations with significantly lower measurement
  density than prior state-of-the-art.
