title: Unbiased Multi-Label Learning from Crowdsourced Annotations
openreview: bgP8Rxv2eB
abstract: This work studies the novel Crowdsourced Multi-Label Learning (CMLL) problem,
  where each instance is related to multiple true labels but the model only receives
  unreliable labels from different annotators. Although a few Crowdsourced Multi-Label
  Inference (CMLI) methods have been developed, they require both the training and
  testing sets to be assigned crowdsourced labels and focus on true label inferring
  rather than prediction, making them less practical. In this paper, by excavating
  the generation process of crowdsourced labels, we establish the first <b>unbiased
  risk estimator</b> for CMLL based on the crowdsourced transition matrices. To facilitate
  transition matrix estimation, we upgrade our unbiased risk estimator by aggregating
  crowdsourced labels and transition matrices from all annotators while guaranteeing
  its theoretical characteristics. Integrating with the unbiased risk estimator, we
  further propose a decoupled autoencoder framework to exploit label correlations
  and boost performance. We also provide a generalization error bound to ensure the
  convergence of the empirical risk estimator. Experiments on various CMLL scenarios
  demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The source code is available
