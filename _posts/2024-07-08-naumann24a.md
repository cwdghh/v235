title: Box Facets and Cut Facets of Lifted Multicut Polytopes
openreview: JJSj8UXqd4
abstract: 'The lifted multicut problem has diverse applications in the field of computer
  vision. Exact algorithms based on linear programming require an understanding of
  lifted multicut polytopes. Despite recent progress, two fundamental questions about
  these polytopes have remained open: Which lower box inequalities define facets,
  and which cut inequalities define facets? In this article, we answer the first question
  by establishing conditions that are necessary, sufficient and efficiently decidable.
  Toward the second question, we show that deciding facet-definingness of cut inequalities
  is NP-hard. This completes the analysis of canonical facets of lifted multicut polytopes.'
