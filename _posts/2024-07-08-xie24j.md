title: 'TravelPlanner: A Benchmark for Real-World Planning with Language Agents'
openreview: l5XQzNkAOe
abstract: Planning has been part of the core pursuit for artificial intelligence since
  its conception, but earlier AI agents mostly focused on constrained settings because
  many of the cognitive substrates necessary for human-level planning have been lacking.
  Recently, language agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown interesting
  capabilities such as tool use and reasoning. Are these language agents capable of
  planning in more complex settings that are out of the reach of prior AI agents?
  To advance this investigation, we propose TravelPlanner, a new planning benchmark
  that focuses on travel planning, a common real-world planning scenario. It provides
  a rich sandbox environment, various tools for accessing nearly four million data
  records, and 1,225 meticulously curated planning intents and reference plans. Comprehensive
  evaluations show that the current language agents are not yet capable of handling
  such complex planning tasksâ€”even GPT-4 only achieves a success rate of 0.6%. Language
  agents struggle to stay on task, use the right tools to collect information, or
  keep track of multiple constraints. However, we note that the mere possibility for
  language agents to tackle such a complex problem is in itself non-trivial progress.
  TravelPlanner provides a challenging yet meaningful testbed for future language
  agents.
