title: Stochastic Q-learning for Large Discrete Action Spaces
openreview: HPQaMmABgK
abstract: In complex environments with large discrete action spaces, effective decision-making
  is critical in reinforcement learning (RL). Despite the widespread use of value-based
  RL approaches like Q-learning, they come with a computational burden, necessitating
  the maximization of a value function over all actions in each iteration. This burden
  becomes particularly challenging when addressing large-scale problems and using
  deep neural networks as function approximators. In this paper, we present stochastic
  value-based RL approaches which, in each iteration, as opposed to optimizing over
  the entire set of $n$ actions, only consider a variable stochastic set of a sublinear
  number of actions, possibly as small as $\mathcal{O}(\log(n))$. The presented stochastic
  value-based RL methods include, among others, Stochastic Q-learning, StochDQN, and
  StochDDQN, all of which integrate this stochastic approach for both value-function
  updates and action selection. The theoretical convergence of Stochastic Q-learning
  is established, while an analysis of stochastic maximization is provided. Moreover,
  through empirical validation, we illustrate that the various proposed approaches
  outperform the baseline methods across diverse environments, including different
  control problems, achieving near-optimal average returns in significantly reduced
  time.
