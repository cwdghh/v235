title: 'Bipartite Matching in Massive Graphs: A Tight Analysis of EDCS'
openreview: EDEISRmi6X
abstract: 'Maximum matching is one of the most fundamental combinatorial optimization
  problems with applications in various contexts such as balanced clustering, data
  mining, resource allocation, and online advertisement. In many of these applications,
  the input graph is massive. The sheer size of these inputs makes it impossible to
  store the whole graph in the memory of a single machine and process it there. Graph
  sparsification has been an extremely powerful tool to alleviate this problem. In
  this paper, we study a highly successful and versatile sparsifier for the matching
  problem: the <em>edge-degree constrained subgraph (EDCS)</em> introduced first by
  Bernstein & Stein 2015 The EDCS has a parameter $\beta \geq 2$ which controls the
  density of the sparsifier. It has been shown through various proofs in the literature
  that by picking a subgraph with $O(n\beta)$ edges, the EDCS includes a matching
  of size at least $2/3-O(1/\beta)$ times the maximum matching size. As such, by increasing
  $\beta$ the approximation ratio of EDCS gets closer and closer to $2/3$. In this
  paper, we propose a new approach for analyzing the approximation ratio of EDCS.
  Our analysis is <em>tight</em> for any value of $\beta$. Namely, we pinpoint the
  precise approximation ratio of EDCS for any sparsity parameter $\beta$. Our analysis
  reveals that one does not necessarily need to increase $\beta$ to improve approximation,
  as suggested by previous analysis. In particular, the best choice turns out to be
  $\beta = 6$, which achieves an approximation ratio of $.677$! This is arguably surprising
  as it is even better than $2/3 \sim .666$, the bound that was widely believed to
  be the limit for EDCS.'
