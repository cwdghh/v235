title: Inferring Dynamic Networks from Marginals with Iterative Proportional Fitting
openreview: KYrAZSbEv6
abstract: 'A common network inference problem, arising from real-world data constraints,
  is how to infer a dynamic network from its time-aggregated adjacency matrix and
  time-varying marginals (i.e., row and column sums). Prior approaches to this problem
  have repurposed the classic iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure, also
  known as Sinkhorn’s algorithm, with promising empirical results. However, the statistical
  foundation for using IPF has not been well understood: under what settings does
  IPF provide principled estimation of a dynamic network from its marginals, and how
  well does it estimate the network? In this work, we establish such a setting, by
  identifying a generative network model whose maximum likelihood estimates are recovered
  by IPF. Our model both reveals implicit assumptions on the use of IPF in such settings
  and enables new analyses, such as structure-dependent error bounds on IPF’s parameter
  estimates. When IPF fails to converge on sparse network data, we introduce a principled
  algorithm that guarantees IPF converges under minimal changes to the network structure.
  Finally, we conduct experiments with synthetic and real-world data, which demonstrate
  the practical value of our theoretical and algorithmic contributions.'
