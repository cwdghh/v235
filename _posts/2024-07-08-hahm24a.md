title: Isometric Representation Learning for Disentangled Latent Space of Diffusion
  Models
openreview: ufCptn28vG
abstract: The latent space of diffusion model mostly still remains unexplored, despite
  its great success and potential in the field of generative modeling. In fact, the
  latent space of existing diffusion models are entangled, with a distorted mapping
  from its latent space to image space. To tackle this problem, we present Isometric
  Diffusion, equipping a diffusion model with a geometric regularizer to guide the
  model to learn a geometrically sound latent space of the training data manifold.
  This approach allows diffusion models to learn a more disentangled latent space,
  which enables smoother interpolation, more accurate inversion, and more precise
  control over attributes directly in the latent space. Our extensive experiments
  consisting of image interpolations, image inversions, and linear editing show the
  effectiveness of our method.
