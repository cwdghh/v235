title: 'Coarse-to-Fine Highlighting: Reducing Knowledge Hallucination in Large Language
  Models'
openreview: JCG0KTPVYy
abstract: 'Generation of plausible but incorrect factual information, often termed
  hallucination, has attracted significant research interest. Retrieval-augmented
  language model (RALM)—which enhances models with up-to-date knowledge—emerges as
  a promising method to reduce hallucination. However, existing RALMs may instead
  exacerbate hallucination when retrieving lengthy contexts. To address this challenge,
  we propose COFT, a novel <b>CO</b>arse-to-<b>F</b>ine highligh<b>T</b>ing method
  to focus on different granularity-level key texts, thereby avoiding getting lost
  in lengthy contexts. Specifically, COFT consists of three components: <em>recaller</em>,
  <em>scorer</em>, and <em>selector</em>. First, <em>recaller</em> applies a knowledge
  graph to extract potential key entities in a given context. Second, <em>scorer</em>
  measures the importance of each entity by calculating its contextual weight. Finally,
  <em>selector</em> selects high contextual weight entities with a dynamic threshold
  algorithm and highlights the corresponding paragraphs, sentences, or words in a
  coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments on knowledge hallucination benchmark
  demonstrate the effectiveness of COFT, leading to a superior performance over 30%
  in F1 score metric. Moreover, COFT also exhibits remarkable versatility across various
  long-form tasks, such as reading comprehension and question answering.'
