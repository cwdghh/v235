title: 'Random features models: a way to study the success of naive imputation'
openreview: B5g6y7JlMw
abstract: Constant (naive) imputation is still widely used in practice as this is
  a first easy-to-use technique to deal with missing data. Yet, this simple method
  could be expected to induce a large bias for prediction purposes, as the imputed
  input may strongly differ from the true underlying data. However, recent works suggest
  that this bias is low in the context of high-dimensional linear predictors when
  data is supposed to be missing completely at random (MCAR). This paper completes
  the picture for linear predictors by confirming the intuition that the bias is negligible
  and that surprisingly naive imputation also remains relevant in very low dimension.
  To this aim, we consider a unique underlying random features model, which offers
  a rigorous framework for studying predictive performances, whilst the dimension
  of the observed features varies. Building on these theoretical results, we establish
  finite-sample bounds on stochastic gradient (SGD) predictors applied to zero-imputed
  data, a strategy particularly well suited for large-scale learning. If the MCAR
  assumption appears to be strong, we show that similar favorable behaviors occur
  for more complex missing data scenarios.
