title: Borda Regret Minimization for Generalized Linear Dueling Bandits
openreview: 3Tzdpjc59k
abstract: Dueling bandits are widely used to model preferential feedback prevalent
  in many applications such as recommendation systems and ranking. In this paper,
  we study the Borda regret minimization problem for dueling bandits, which aims to
  identify the item with the highest Borda score while minimizing the cumulative regret.
  We propose a rich class of generalized linear dueling bandit models, which cover
  many existing models. We first prove a regret lower bound of order $\Omega(d^{2/3}
  T^{2/3})$ for the Borda regret minimization problem, where $d$ is the dimension
  of contextual vectors and $T$ is the time horizon. To attain this lower bound, we
  propose an explore-then-commit type algorithm for the stochastic setting, which
  has a nearly matching regret upper bound $\tilde{O}(d^{2/3} T^{2/3})$. We also propose
  an EXP3-type algorithm for the adversarial linear setting, where the underlying
  model parameter can change in each round. Our algorithm achieves an $\tilde{O}(d^{2/3}
  T^{2/3})$ regret, which is also optimal. Empirical evaluations on both synthetic
  data and a simulated real-world environment are conducted to corroborate our theoretical
  analysis.
