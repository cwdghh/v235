title: Auto-Regressive Next-Token Predictors are Universal Learners
openreview: i56plqPpEa
abstract: Large language models display remarkable capabilities in logical and mathematical
  reasoning, allowing them to solve complex tasks. Interestingly, these abilities
  emerge in networks trained on the simple task of next-token prediction. In this
  work, we present a theoretical framework for studying auto-regressive next-token
  predictors. We demonstrate that even simple models such as linear next-token predictors,
  trained on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, can approximate any function efficiently
  computed by a Turing machine. We introduce a new complexity measure—length complexity—which
  measures the number of intermediate tokens in a CoT sequence required to approximate
  some target function, and analyze the interplay between length complexity and other
  notions of complexity. Finally, we show experimentally that simple next-token predictors,
  such as linear networks and shallow Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), display non-trivial
  performance on text generation and arithmetic tasks. Our results demonstrate that
  the power of today’s LLMs can be attributed, to a great extent, to the auto-regressive
  next-token training scheme, and not necessarily to a particular choice of architecture.
