title: 3D Geometric Shape Assembly via Efficient Point Cloud Matching
openreview: FYQIgQWH3d
abstract: 'Learning to assemble geometric shapes into a larger target structure is
  a pivotal task in various practical applications. In this work, we tackle this problem
  by establishing local correspondences between point clouds of part shapes in both
  coarse- and fine-levels. To this end, we introduce Proxy Match Transform (PMT),
  an approximate high-order feature transform layer that enables reliable matching
  between mating surfaces of parts while incurring low costs in memory and compute.
  Building upon PMT, we introduce a new framework, dubbed Proxy Match TransformeR
  (PMTR), for the geometric assembly task. We evaluate the proposed PMTR on the large-scale
  3D geometric shape assembly benchmark dataset of Breaking Bad and demonstrate its
  superior performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project
