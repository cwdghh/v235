title: 'Prometheus: Out-of-distribution Fluid Dynamics Modeling with Disentangled
  Graph ODE'
openreview: JsPvL6ExK8
abstract: Fluid dynamics modeling has received extensive attention in the machine
  learning community. Although numerous graph neural network (GNN) approaches have
  been proposed for this problem, the problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization
  remains underexplored. In this work, we propose a new large-scale dataset Prometheus
  which simulates tunnel and pool fires across various environmental conditions and
  builds an extensive benchmark of 12 baselines, which demonstrates that the OOD generalization
  performance is far from satisfactory. To tackle this, this paper introduces a new
  approach named Disentangled Graph ODE (DGODE), which learns disentangled representations
  for continuous interacting dynamics modeling. In particular, we utilize a temporal
  GNN and a frequency network to extract semantics from historical trajectories into
  node representations and environment representations respectively. To mitigate the
  potential distribution shift, we minimize the mutual information between invariant
  node representations and the discretized environment features using adversarial
  learning. Then, they are fed into a coupled graph ODE framework, which models the
  evolution using neighboring nodes and dynamical environmental context. In addition,
  we enhance the stability of the framework by perturbing the environment features
  to enhance robustness. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of DGODE
  compared with state-of-the-art approaches.
