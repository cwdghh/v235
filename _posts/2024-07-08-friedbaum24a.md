title: Trustworthy Actionable Perturbations
openreview: zkjGpZrIX3
abstract: "<em>Counterfactuals</em>, or modified inputs that lead to a different outcome,
  are an important tool for understanding the logic used by machine learning classifiers
  and how to change an undesirable classification. Even if a counterfactual changes
  a classifier’s decision, however, it may not affect the true underlying class probabilities,
  i.e. the counterfactual may act like an adversarial attack and “fool” the classifier.
  We propose a new framework for creating modified inputs that change the true underlying
  probabilities in a beneficial way which we call <em>Trustworthy Actionable Perturbations</em>
  (TAP). This includes a novel verification procedure to ensure that TAP change the
  true class probabilities instead of acting adversarially. Our framework also includes
  new cost, reward, and goal definitions that are better suited to effectuating change
  in the real world. We present PAC-learnability results for our verification procedure
  and theoretically analyze our new method for measuring reward. We also develop a
  methodology for creating TAP and compare our results to those achieved by previous
  counterfactual methods."
