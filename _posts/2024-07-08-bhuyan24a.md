title: Best of Both Worlds Guarantees for Smoothed Online Quadratic Optimization
openreview: icijMMWwdG
abstract: We study the smoothed online quadratic optimization (SOQO) problem where,
  at each round $t$, a player plays an action $x_t$ in response to a quadratic hitting
  cost and an additional squared $\ell_2$-norm cost for switching actions. This problem
  class has strong connections to a wide range of application domains including smart
  grid management, adaptive control, and data center management, where switching-efficient
  algorithms are highly sought after. We study the SOQO problem in both adversarial
  and stochastic settings, and in this process, perform the first stochastic analysis
  of this class of problems. We provide the online optimal algorithm when the minimizers
  of the hitting cost function evolve as a general stochastic process, which, for
  the case of martingale process, takes the form of a <em>distribution-agnostic dynamic
  interpolation algorithm</em> that we call Lazy Adaptive Interpolation (LAI). Next,
  we present the stochastic-adversarial trade-off by proving an $\Omega(T)$ expected
  regret for the adversarial optimal algorithm in the literature (ROBD) with respect
  to LAI and, a sub-optimal competitive ratio for LAI in the adversarial setting.
  Finally, we present a best-of-both-worlds algorithm that obtains a robust adversarial
  performance while simultaneously achieving a near-optimal stochastic performance.
