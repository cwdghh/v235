title: 'Not Just Pretty Pictures: Toward Interventional Data Augmentation Using Text-to-Image
  Generators'
openreview: b89JtZj9gm
abstract: Neural image classifiers are known to undergo severe performance degradation
  when exposed to inputs that are sampled from environmental conditions that differ
  from their training data. Given the recent progress in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation,
  a natural question is how modern T2I generators can be used to simulate arbitrary
  interventions over such environmental factors in order to augment training data
  and improve the robustness of downstream classifiers. We experiment across a diverse
  collection of benchmarks in single domain generalization (SDG) and reducing reliance
  on spurious features (RRSF), ablating across key dimensions of T2I generation, including
  interventional prompting strategies, conditioning mechanisms, and post-hoc filtering,
  showing that modern T2I generators like Stable Diffusion can indeed be used to implement
  a powerful interventional data augmentation (IDA) mechanism, outperforming previously
  state-of-the-art data augmentation techniques regardless of how each dimension is
  configured.
