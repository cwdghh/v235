title: 'Lookbehind-SAM: k steps back, 1 step forward'
openreview: vCN5lwcWWE
abstract: Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) methods have gained increasing popularity
  by formulating the problem of minimizing both loss value and loss sharpness as a
  minimax objective. In this work, we increase the efficiency of the maximization
  and minimization parts of SAMâ€™s objective to achieve a better loss-sharpness trade-off.
  By taking inspiration from the Lookahead optimizer, which uses multiple descent
  steps ahead, we propose Lookbehind, which performs multiple ascent steps behind
  to enhance the maximization step of SAM and find a worst-case perturbation with
  higher loss. Then, to mitigate the variance in the descent step arising from the
  gathered gradients across the multiple ascent steps, we employ linear interpolation
  to refine the minimization step. Lookbehind leads to a myriad of benefits across
  a variety of tasks. Particularly, we show increased generalization performance,
  greater robustness against noisy weights, as well as improved learning and less
  catastrophic forgetting in lifelong learning settings. Our code is available at
