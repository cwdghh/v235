title: 'Naive Bayes Classifiers over Missing Data: Decision and Poisoning'
openreview: QhKsE7YAJk
abstract: 'We study the certifiable robustness of ML classifiers on dirty datasets
  that could contain missing values. A test point is certifiably robust for an ML
  classifier if the classifier returns the same prediction for that test point, regardless
  of which cleaned version (among exponentially many) of the dirty dataset the classifier
  is trained on. In this paper, we show theoretically that for Naive Bayes Classifiers
  (NBC) over dirty datasets with missing values: (i) there exists an efficient polynomial
  time algorithm to decide whether multiple input test points are all certifiably
  robust over a dirty dataset; and (ii) the data poisoning attack, which aims to make
  all input test points certifiably non-robust by inserting missing cells to the clean
  dataset, is in polynomial time for single test points but NP-complete for multiple
  test points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our algorithms are efficient
  and outperform existing baselines.'
