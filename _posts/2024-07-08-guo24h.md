title: Automated Loss function Search for Class-imbalanced Node Classification
openreview: O1hmwi51pp
abstract: Class-imbalanced node classification tasks are prevalent in real-world scenarios.
  Due to the uneven distribution of nodes across different classes, learning high-quality
  node representations remains a challenging endeavor. The engineering of loss functions
  has shown promising potential in addressing this issue. It involves the meticulous
  design of loss functions, utilizing information about the quantities of nodes in
  different categories and the networkâ€™s topology to learn unbiased node representations.
  However, the design of these loss functions heavily relies on human expert knowledge
  and exhibits limited adaptability to specific target tasks. In this paper, we introduce
  a high-performance, flexible, and generalizable automated loss function search framework
  to tackle this challenge. Across 15 combinations of graph neural networks and datasets,
  our framework achieves a significant improvement in performance compared to state-of-the-art
  methods. Additionally, we observe that homophily in graph-structured data significantly
  contributes to the transferability of the proposed framework.
