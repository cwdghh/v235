title: 'Quality-Diversity Actor-Critic: Learning High-Performing and Diverse Behaviors
  via Value and Successor Features Critics'
openreview: ISG3l8nXrI
abstract: 'A key aspect of intelligence is the ability to demonstrate a broad spectrum
  of behaviors for adapting to unexpected situations. Over the past decade, advancements
  in deep reinforcement learning have led to groundbreaking achievements to solve
  complex continuous control tasks. However, most approaches return only one solution
  specialized for a specific problem. We introduce Quality-Diversity Actor-Critic
  (QDAC), an off-policy actor-critic deep reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages
  a value function critic and a successor features critic to learn high-performing
  and diverse behaviors. In this framework, the actor optimizes an objective that
  seamlessly unifies both critics using constrained optimization to (1) maximize return,
  while (2) executing diverse skills. Compared with other Quality-Diversity methods,
  QDAC achieves significantly higher performance and more diverse behaviors on six
  challenging continuous control locomotion tasks. We also demonstrate that we can
  harness the learned skills to adapt better than other baselines to five perturbed
  environments. Finally, qualitative analyses showcase a range of remarkable behaviors:
