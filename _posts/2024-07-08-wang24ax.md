title: Achieving Margin Maximization Exponentially Fast via Progressive Norm Rescaling
openreview: xS2YKQlBIZ
abstract: In this work, we investigate the margin-maximization bias exhibited by gradient-based
  algorithms in classifying linearly separable data. We present an in-depth analysis
  of the specific properties of the velocity field associated with (normalized) gradients,
  focusing on their role in margin maximization. Inspired by this analysis, we propose
  a novel algorithm called Progressive Rescaling Gradient Descent (PRGD) and show
  that PRGD can maximize the margin at an <em>exponential rate</em>. This stands in
  stark contrast to all existing algorithms, which maximize the margin at a slow <em>polynomial
  rate</em>. Specifically, we identify mild conditions on data distribution under
  which existing algorithms such as gradient descent (GD) and normalized gradient
  descent (NGD) <em>provably fail</em> in maximizing the margin efficiently. To validate
  our theoretical findings, we present both synthetic and real-world experiments.
  Notably, PRGD also shows promise in enhancing the generalization performance when
  applied to linearly non-separable datasets and deep neural networks.
