title: Optimal Differentially Private Model Training with Public Data
openreview: NFEJQn7vX0
abstract: 'Differential privacy (DP) ensures that training a machine learning model
  does not leak private data. In practice, we may have access to auxiliary public
  data that is free of privacy concerns. In this work, we assume access to a given
  amount of public data and settle the following fundamental open questions: 1. What
  is the optimal (worst-case) error of a DP model trained over a private data set
  while having access to side public data? 2. How can we harness public data to improve
  DP model training in practice? We consider these questions in both the local and
  central models of pure and approximate DP. To answer the first question, we prove
  tight (up to log factors) lower and upper bounds that characterize the optimal error
  rates of three fundamental problems: mean estimation, empirical risk minimization,
  and stochastic convex optimization. We show that the optimal error rates can be
  attained (up to log factors) by either discarding private data and training a public
  model, or treating public data like it is private and using an optimal DP algorithm.
  To address the second question, we develop novel algorithms that are "even more
  optimal" (i.e. better constants) than the asymptotically optimal approaches described
  above. For local DP mean estimation, our algorithm is optimal including constants.
  Empirically, our algorithms show benefits over the state-of-the-art.'
