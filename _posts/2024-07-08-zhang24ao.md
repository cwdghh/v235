title: 'Wukong: Towards a Scaling Law for Large-Scale Recommendation'
openreview: 8iUgr2nuwo
abstract: Scaling laws play an instrumental role in the sustainable improvement in
  model quality. Unfortunately, recommendation models to date do not exhibit such
  laws similar to those observed in the domain of large language models, due to the
  inefficiencies of their upscaling mechanisms. This limitation poses significant
  challenges in adapting these models to increasingly more complex real-world datasets.
  In this paper, we propose an effective network architecture based purely on stacked
  factorization machines, and a synergistic upscaling strategy, collectively dubbed
  Wukong, to establish a scaling law in the domain of recommendation. Wukong’s unique
  design makes it possible to capture diverse, any-order of interactions simply through
  taller and wider layers. We conducted extensive evaluations on six public datasets,
  and our results demonstrate that Wukong consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
  models quality-wise. Further, we assessed Wukong’s scalability on an internal, large-scale
  dataset. The results show that Wukong retains its superiority in quality over state-of-the-art
  models, while holding the scaling law across two orders of magnitude in model complexity,
  extending beyond 100 GFLOP/example, where prior arts fall short.
