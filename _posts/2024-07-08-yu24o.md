title: 'MM-Vet: Evaluating Large Multimodal Models for Integrated Capabilities'
openreview: KOTutrSR2y
abstract: 'We propose MM-Vet, an evaluation benchmark that examines large multimodal
  models (LMMs) on complicated multimodal tasks. Recent LMMs have shown various intriguing
  abilities, such as solving math problems written on the blackboard, reasoning about
  events and celebrities in news images, and explaining visual jokes. Rapid model
  advancements pose challenges to evaluation benchmark development. Problems include:
  (1) How to systematically structure and evaluate the complicated multimodal tasks;
  (2) How to design evaluation metrics that work well across question and answer types;
  and (3) How to give model insights beyond a simple performance ranking. To this
  end, we present MM-Vet, designed based on the insight that the intriguing ability
  to solve complicated tasks is often achieved by a generalist model being able to
  integrate different core vision-language (VL) capabilities. MM-Vet defines 6 core
  VL capabilities and examines the 16 integrations of interest derived from the capability
  combination. For evaluation metrics, we propose an LLM-based evaluator for open-ended
  outputs. The evaluator enables the evaluation across different question types and
  answer styles, resulting in a unified scoring metric. We evaluate representative
  LMMs on MM-Vet, providing insights into the capabilities of different LMM system
  paradigms and models.'
