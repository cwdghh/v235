title: Distributionally Robust Data Valuation
openreview: mbBehLOAqR
abstract: Data valuation quantifies the contribution of each data point to the performance
  of a machine learning model. Existing works typically define the value of data by
  its improvement of the validation performance of the trained model. However, this
  approach can be impractical to apply in collaborative machine learning and data
  marketplace since it is difficult for the parties/buyers to agree on a common validation
  dataset or determine the exact validation distribution <em>a priori</em>. To address
  this, we propose a <em>distributionally robust data valuation</em> approach to perform
  data valuation without known/fixed validation distributions. Our approach defines
  the value of data by its improvement of the distributionally robust generalization
  error (DRGE), thus providing a worst-case performance guarantee <em>without</em>
  a known/fixed validation distribution. However, since computing DRGE directly is
  infeasible, we propose using <em>model deviation</em> as a proxy for the marginal
  improvement of DRGE (for kernel regression and neural networks) to compute data
  values. Furthermore, we identify a notion of uniqueness where low uniqueness characterizes
  low-value data. We empirically demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
  data valuation approaches in data selection and data removal tasks on real-world
  datasets (e.g., housing price prediction, diabetes hospitalization prediction).
