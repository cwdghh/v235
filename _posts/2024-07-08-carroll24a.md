title: AI Alignment with Changing and Influenceable Reward Functions
openreview: itYGbe0Cs1
abstract: 'Existing AI alignment approaches assume that preferences are static, which
  is unrealistic: our preferences change, and may even be influenced by our interactions
  with AI systems themselves. To clarify the consequences of incorrectly assuming
  static preferences, we introduce Dynamic Reward Markov Decision Processes (DR-MDPs),
  which explicitly model preference changes and the AI’s influence on them. We show
  that despite its convenience, the static-preference assumption may undermine the
  soundness of existing alignment techniques, leading them to implicitly reward AI
  systems for influencing user preferences in ways users may not truly want. We then
  explore potential solutions. First, we offer a unifying perspective on how an agent’s
  optimization horizon may partially help reduce undesirable AI influence. Then, we
  formalize different notions of AI alignment that account for preference change from
  the outset. Comparing the strengths and limitations of 8 such notions of alignment,
  we find that they all either err towards causing undesirable AI influence, or are
  overly risk-averse, suggesting that a straightforward solution to the problems of
  changing preferences may not exist. As there is no avoiding grappling with changing
  preferences in real-world settings, this makes it all the more important to handle
  these issues with care, balancing risks and capabilities. We hope our work can provide
  conceptual clarity and constitute a first step towards AI alignment practices which
  explicitly account for (and contend with) the changing and influenceable nature
  of human preferences.'
