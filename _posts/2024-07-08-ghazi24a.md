title: Individualized Privacy Accounting via Subsampling with Applications in Combinatorial
  Optimization
openreview: zfmwAaB9Nw
abstract: 'In this work, we give a new technique for analyzing individualized privacy
  accounting via the following simple observation: if an algorithm is one-sided add-DP,
  then its subsampled variant satisfies two-sided DP. From this, we obtain several
  improved algorithms for private combinatorial optimization problems, including decomposable
  submodular maximization and set cover. Our error guarantees are asymptotically tight
  and our algorithm satisfies pure-DP while previously known algorithms (Gupta et
  al., 2010; Chaturvedi et al., 2021) are approximate-DP. We also show an application
  of our technique beyond combinatorial optimization by giving a pure-DP algorithm
  for the shifting heavy hitter problem in a stream; previously, only an approximate-DP
  algorithm was known (Kaplan et al., 2021; Cohen & Lyu, 2023).'
