title: Projecting Molecules into Synthesizable Chemical Spaces
openreview: scFlbJQdm1
abstract: 'Discovering new drug molecules is a pivotal yet challenging process due
  to the near-infinitely large chemical space and notorious demands on time and resources.
  Numerous generative models have recently been introduced to accelerate the drug
  discovery process, but their progression to experimental validation remains limited,
  largely due to a lack of consideration for synthetic accessibility in practical
  settings. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that is capable of generating
  new chemical structures while ensuring synthetic accessibility. Specifically, we
  introduce a postfix notation of synthetic pathways to represent molecules in chemical
  space. Then, we design a transformer-based model to translate molecular graphs into
  postfix notations of synthesis. We highlight the modelâ€™s ability to: (a) perform
  bottom-up synthesis planning more accurately, (b) generate structurally similar,
  synthesizable analogs for unsynthesizable molecules proposed by generative models
  with their properties preserved, and (c) explore the local synthesizable chemical
  space around hit molecules.'
