title: 'Chain of Code: Reasoning with a Language Model-Augmented Code Emulator'
openreview: vKtomqlSxm
abstract: 'Code provides a general syntactic structure to build complex programs and
  perform precise computations when paired with a code interpreter â€“ we hypothesize
  that language models (LMs) can leverage code-writing to improve Chain of Thought
  reasoning not only for logic and arithmetic tasks, but also for semantic ones (and
  in particular, those that are a mix of both). For example, consider prompting an
  LM to write code that counts the number of times it detects sarcasm in an essay:
  the LM may struggle to write an implementation for "detect_sarcasm(string)" that
  can be executed by the interpreter (handling the edge cases would be insurmountable).
  However, LMs may still produce a valid solution if they not only write code, but
  also selectively "emulate" the interpreter by generating the expected output of
  "detect_sarcasm(string)". In this work, we propose Chain of Code (CoC), a simple
  yet surprisingly effective extension that improves LM code-driven reasoning. The
  key idea is to encourage LMs to format semantic sub-tasks in a program as flexible
  pseudocode that the interpreter can explicitly catch undefined behaviors and hand
  off to simulate with an LM (as an "LMulator"). Experiments demonstrate that Chain
  of Code outperforms Chain of Thought and other baselines across a variety of benchmarks;
  on BIG-Bench Hard, Chain of Code achieves 84%, a gain of 12% over Chain of Thought.
  In a nutshell, CoC broadens the scope of reasoning questions that LMs can answer
  by "thinking in code".'
