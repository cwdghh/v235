title: Conditional Normalizing Flows for Active Learning of Coarse-Grained Molecular
  Representations
openreview: N3ZrpSCJcJ
abstract: Efficient sampling of the Boltzmann distribution of molecular systems is
  a long-standing challenge. Recently, instead of generating long molecular dynamics
  simulations, generative machine learning methods such as normalizing flows have
  been used to learn the Boltzmann distribution directly, without samples. However,
  this approach is susceptible to mode collapse and thus often does not explore the
  full configurational space. In this work, we address this challenge by separating
  the problem into two levels, the fine-grained and coarse-grained degrees of freedom.
  A normalizing flow conditioned on the coarse-grained space yields a probabilistic
  connection between the two levels. To explore the configurational space, we employ
  coarse-grained simulations with active learning which allows us to update the flow
  and make all-atom potential energy evaluations only when necessary. Using alanine
  dipeptide as an example, we show that our methods obtain a speedup to molecular
  dynamics simulations of approximately $15.9$ to $216.2$ compared to the speedup
  of $4.5$ of the current state-of-the-art machine learning approach.
