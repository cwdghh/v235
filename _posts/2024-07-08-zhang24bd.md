title: Provable Representation with Efficient Planning for Partially Observable Reinforcement
  Learning
openreview: O6tenHWTUU
abstract: In most real-world reinforcement learning applications, state information
  is only partially observable, which breaks the Markov decision process assumption
  and leads to inferior performance for algorithms that conflate observations with
  state. Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), on the other hand,
  provide a general framework that allows for partial observability to be accounted
  for in <em>learning, exploration and planning</em>, but presents significant computational
  and statistical challenges. To address these difficulties, we develop a representation-based
  perspective that leads to a coherent framework and tractable algorithmic approach
  for practical reinforcement learning from partial observations. We provide a theoretical
  analysis for justifying the statistical efficiency of the proposed algorithm, and
  also empirically demonstrate the proposed algorithm can surpass state-of-the-art
  performance with partial observations across various benchmarks, advancing reliable
  reinforcement learning towards more practical applications.
