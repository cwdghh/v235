title: A Linear Time and Space Local Point Cloud Geometry Encoder via Vectorized Kernel
  Mixture (VecKM)
openreview: oYltxxam2t
abstract: 'We propose VecKM, a local point cloud geometry encoder that is descriptive
  and efficient to compute. VecKM leverages a unique approach by vectorizing a kernel
  mixture to represent the local point cloud. Such representation’s descriptiveness
  is supported by two theorems that validate its ability to reconstruct and preserve
  the similarity of the local shape. Unlike existing encoders downsampling the local
  point cloud, VecKM constructs the local geometry encoding using all neighboring
  points, producing a more descriptive encoding. Moreover, VecKM is efficient to compute
  and scalable to large point cloud inputs: VecKM reduces the memory cost from $(n^2+nKd)$
  to $(nd+np)$; and reduces the major runtime cost from computing $nK$ MLPs to $n$
  MLPs, where $n$ is the size of the point cloud, $K$ is the neighborhood size, $d$
  is the encoding dimension, and $p$ is a marginal factor. The efficiency is due to
  VecKM’s unique factorizable property that eliminates the need of explicitly grouping
  points into neighbors. In the normal estimation task, VecKM demonstrates not only
  100x faster inference speed but also highest accuracy and strongest robustness.
  In classification and segmentation tasks, integrating VecKM as a preprocessing module
  achieves consistently better performance than the PointNet, PointNet++, and point
  transformer baselines, and runs consistently faster by up to 10 times.'
