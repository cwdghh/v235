title: An LLM Compiler for Parallel Function Calling
openreview: uQ2FUoFjnF
abstract: 'The reasoning capabilities of the recent LLMs enable them to execute external
  function calls to overcome their inherent limitations, such as knowledge cutoffs,
  poor arithmetic skills, or lack of access to private data. This development has
  allowed LLMs to select and coordinate multiple functions based on the context to
  tackle more complex problems. However, current methods for function calling often
  require sequential reasoning and acting for each function which can result in high
  latency, cost, and sometimes inaccurate behavior. To address this, we introduce
  LLMCompiler, which executes functions in parallel to efficiently orchestrate multiple
  function calls. Drawing inspiration from the principles of classical compilers,
  LLMCompiler enables parallel function calling with three components: (i) a Function
  Calling Planner, formulating execution plans for function calling; (ii) a Task Fetching
  Unit, dispatching function calling tasks; and (iii) an Executor, executing these
  tasks in parallel. LLMCompiler automatically generates an optimized orchestration
  for the function calls and can be used with both open-source and closed-source models.
  We have benchmarked LLMCompiler on a range of tasks with different patterns of function
  calling. We observe consistent latency speedup of up to $3.7 \times$, cost savings
  of up to $6.7 \times$, and accuracy improvement of up to $\sim 9 %$ compared to
  ReAct.Our code is available at https://github.com/SqueezeAILab/LLMCompiler.'
