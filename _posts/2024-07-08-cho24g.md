title: 'Tilt and Average : Geometric Adjustment of the Last Layer for Recalibration'
openreview: 61A1bsVjRg
abstract: After the revelation that neural networks tend to produce overconfident
  predictions, the problem of calibration, which aims to align confidence with accuracy
  to enhance the reliability of predictions, has gained significant importance. Several
  solutions based on calibration maps have been proposed to address the problem of
  recalibrating a trained classifier using additional datasets. In this paper, we
  offer an algorithm that transforms the weights of the last layer of the classifier,
  distinct from the calibration-map-based approach. We concentrate on the geometry
  of the final linear layer, specifically its angular aspect, and adjust the weights
  of the corresponding layer. We name the method Tilt and Average, and validate the
  calibration effect empirically and theoretically. Through this, we demonstrate that
  our approach, in addition to the existing calibration-map-based techniques, can
  yield improved calibration performance.
