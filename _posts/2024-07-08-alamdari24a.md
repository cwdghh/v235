title: 'Remembering to Be Fair: Non-Markovian Fairness in Sequential Decision Making'
openreview: 4BIOZSz7zU
abstract: Fair decision making has largely been studied with respect to a single decision.
  Here we investigate the notion of fairness in the context of sequential decision
  making where multiple stakeholders can be affected by the outcomes of decisions.
  We observe that fairness often depends on the history of the sequential decision-making
  process, and in this sense that it is inherently non-Markovian. We further observe
  that fairness often needs to be assessed at time points <em>within</em> the process,
  not just at the end of the process. To advance our understanding of this class of
  fairness problems, we explore the notion of non-Markovian fairness in the context
  of sequential decision making. We identify properties of non-Markovian fairness,
  including notions of long-term, anytime, periodic, and bounded fairness. We explore
  the interplay between non-Markovian fairness and memory and how memory can support
  construction of fair policies. Finally, we introduce the FairQCM algorithm, which
  can automatically augment its training data to improve sample efficiency in the
  synthesis of fair policies via reinforcement learning.
