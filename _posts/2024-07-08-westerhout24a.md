title: On the Asymptotic Distribution of the Minimum Empirical Risk
openreview: 8RwhTPACAO
abstract: Empirical risk minimization (ERM) is a foundational framework for the estimation
  of solutions to statistical and machine learning problems. Characterizing the distributional
  properties of the minimum empirical risk (MER) provides valuable tools for conducting
  inference and assessing the goodness of model fit. We provide a comprehensive account
  of the asymptotic distribution for the order-$\sqrt{n}$ blowup of the MER under
  generic and abstract assumptions, and present practical conditions under which our
  theorems hold. Our results improve upon and relax the assumptions made in previous
  works. Specifically, we provide asymptotic distributions for MERs for non-independent
  and identically distributed data, and when the loss functions may be discontinuous
  or indexed by non-Euclidean spaces. We further present results that enable the application
  of these asymptotics for statistical inference. Specifically, the construction of
  consistent confidence sets using the bootstrap and consistent hypothesis tests using
  penalized model selection. We illustrate the utility of our approach by applying
  our results to neural network problems.
