title: Safe Reinforcement Learning using Finite-Horizon Gradient-based Estimation
openreview: BiENLaUwlK
abstract: A key aspect of Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) involves estimating
  the constraint condition for the next policy, which is crucial for guiding the optimization
  of safe policy updates. However, the existing <em>Advantage-based Estimation</em>
  (ABE) method relies on the infinite-horizon discounted advantage function. This
  dependence leads to catastrophic errors in finite-horizon scenarios with non-discounted
  constraints, resulting in safety-violation updates. In response, we propose the
  first estimation method for finite-horizon non-discounted constraints in deep Safe
  RL, termed <em>Gradient-based Estimation</em> (GBE), which relies on the analytic
  gradient derived along trajectories. Our theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate
  that GBE can effectively estimate constraint changes over a finite horizon. Constructing
  a surrogate optimization problem with GBE, we developed a novel Safe RL algorithm
  called <em>Constrained Gradient-based Policy Optimization</em> (CGPO). CGPO identifies
  feasible optimal policies by iteratively resolving sub-problems within trust regions.
  Our empirical results reveal that CGPO, unlike baseline algorithms, successfully
  estimates the constraint functions of subsequent policies, thereby ensuring the
  efficiency and feasibility of each update.
