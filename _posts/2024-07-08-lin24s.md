title: 'GeoAB: Towards Realistic Antibody Design and Reliable Affinity Maturation'
openreview: 6pHP51F55x
abstract: 'Increasing works for antibody design are emerging to generate sequences
  and structures in Complementarity Determining Regions (CDRs), but problems still
  exist. We focus on two of them: (i) authenticity of the generated structure and
  (ii) rationality of the affinity maturation, and propose GeoAB as a solution. In
  specific, GeoAB-Designergenerates CDR structures with realistic internal geometries,
  composed of a generative geometry initializer (Geo-Initializer) and a position refiner
  (Geo-Refiner); GeoAB-Optimizer achieves affinity maturation by accurately predicting
  both the mutation effects and structures of mutant antibodies with the same network
  architecture as Geo-Refiner. Experiments show that GeoAB achieves state-of-the-art
  performance in CDR co-design and mutation effect predictions, and fulfills the discussed
  tasks effectively.'
