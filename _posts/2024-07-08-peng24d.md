title: 'Pragmatic Feature Preferences: Learning Reward-Relevant Preferences from Human
  Input'
openreview: OgG0I5toZZ
abstract: Humans use context to specify preferences over behaviors, i.e. their reward
  functions. Yet, algorithms for inferring reward models from preference data do not
  take this social learning view into account. Inspired by pragmatic human communication,
  we study how to extract fine-grained data regarding why an example is preferred
  that is useful for learning an accurate reward model. We propose to enrich preference
  queries to ask both (1) which features of a given example are preferable in addition
  to (2) comparisons between objects. We derive an approach for learning from these
  feature-level preferences, both for cases where users specify which features are
  reward-relevant, and when users do not. We evaluate our approach on linear bandit
  settings in both visual and language-based domains. Results support the efficiency
  of our approach in quickly converging to accurate rewards with less comparisons
  vs. example-only labels. Finally, we validate the real-world applicability with
  a behavioral experiment on a mushroom foraging task. Our findings suggest that incorporating
  pragmatic feature preferences is a promising approach for more efficient user-aligned
  reward learning.
