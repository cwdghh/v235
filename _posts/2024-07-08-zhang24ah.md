title: Tackling Non-Stationarity in Reinforcement Learning via Causal-Origin Representation
openreview: WLGWMDtj8L
abstract: In real-world scenarios, the application of reinforcement learning is significantly
  challenged by complex non-stationarity. Most existing methods attempt to model changes
  in the environment explicitly, often requiring impractical prior knowledge of environments.
  In this paper, we propose a new perspective, positing that non-stationarity can
  propagate and accumulate through complex causal relationships during state transitions,
  thereby compounding its sophistication and affecting policy learning. We believe
  that this challenge can be more effectively addressed by implicitly tracing the
  causal origin of non-stationarity. To this end, we introduce the Causal-Origin REPresentation
  (COREP) algorithm. COREP primarily employs a guided updating mechanism to learn
  a stable graph representation for the state, termed as causal-origin representation.
  By leveraging this representation, the learned policy exhibits impressive resilience
  to non-stationarity. We supplement our approach with a theoretical analysis grounded
  in the causal interpretation for non-stationary reinforcement learning, advocating
  for the validity of the causal-origin representation. Experimental results further
  demonstrate the superior performance of COREP over existing methods in tackling
  non-stationarity problems. The code is available at https://github.com/PKU-RL/COREP.
