title: GPT-4V(ision) is a Generalist Web Agent, if Grounded
openreview: piecKJ2DlB
abstract: The recent development on large multimodal models (LMMs), especially GPT-4V(ision)
  and Gemini, has been quickly expanding the capability boundaries of multimodal models
  beyond traditional tasks like image captioning and visual question answering. In
  this work, we explore the potential of LMMs like GPT-4V as a generalist web agent
  that can follow natural language instructions to complete tasks on any given website.
  We propose SEEACT, a generalist web agent that harnesses the power of LMMs for integrated
  visual understanding and acting on the web. We evaluate on the recent MIND2WEB benchmark.
  In addition to standard offline evaluation on cached websites, we enable a new online
  evaluation setting by developing a tool that allows running web agents on live websites.
  We show that GPT-4V presents a great potential for web agentsâ€”it can successfully
  complete 51.1% of the tasks on live websites if we manually ground its textual plans
  into actions on the websites. This substantially outperforms text-only LLMs like
  GPT-4 or smaller models (FLAN-T5 and BLIP-2) specifically fine-tuned for web agents.
  However, grounding still remains a major challenge. Existing LMM grounding strategies
  like set-of-mark prompting turns out to be not effective for web agents, and the
  best grounding strategy we develop in this paper leverages both the HTML structure
  and visuals. Yet, there is still a substantial gap with oracle grounding, leaving
  ample room for further improvement. All code, data, and evaluation tools are available
