title: 'ReDiffuser: Reliable Decision-Making Using a Diffuser with Confidence Estimation'
openreview: OI1YP53WKI
abstract: The diffusion model has demonstrated impressive performance in offline reinforcement
  learning. However, non-deterministic sampling in diffusion models can lead to unstable
  performance. Furthermore, the lack of confidence measurements makes it difficult
  to evaluate the reliability and trustworthiness of the sampled decisions. To address
  these issues, we present ReDiffuser, which utilizes confidence estimation to ensure
  reliable decision-making. We achieve this by learning a confidence function based
  on Random Network Distillation. The confidence function measures the reliability
  of sampled decisions and contributes to quantitative recognition of reliable decisions.
  Additionally, we integrate the confidence function into task-specific sampling procedures
  to realize adaptive-horizon planning and value-embedded planning. Experiments show
  that the proposed ReDiffuser achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard offline
  RL datasets.
