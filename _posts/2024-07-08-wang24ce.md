title: Probability Distribution of Hypervolume Improvement in Bi-objective Bayesian
  Optimization
openreview: XvmooikuHE
abstract: Hypervolume improvement (HVI) is commonly employed in multi-objective Bayesian
  optimization algorithms to define acquisition functions due to its Pareto-compliant
  property. Rather than focusing on specific statistical moments of HVI, this work
  aims to provide the exact expression of HVI’s probability distribution for bi-objective
  problems. Considering a bi-variate Gaussian random variable resulting from Gaussian
  process (GP) modeling, we derive the probability distribution of its hypervolume
  improvement via a cell partition-based method. Our exact expression is superior
  in numerical accuracy and computation efficiency compared to the Monte Carlo approximation
  of HVI’s distribution. Utilizing this distribution, we propose a novel acquisition
  function - $\varepsilon$-probability of hypervolume improvement ($\varepsilon$-PoHVI).
  Experimentally, we show that on many widely-applied bi-objective test problems,
  $\varepsilon$-PoHVI significantly outperforms other related acquisition functions,
  e.g., $\varepsilon$-PoI, and expected hypervolume improvement, when the GP model
  exhibits a large the prediction uncertainty.
