title: Improving Generalization in Offline Reinforcement Learning via Adversarial
  Data Splitting
openreview: CV9PiQGt0i
abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) commonly suffers from the out-of-distribution
  (OOD) overestimation issue due to the distribution shift. Prior work gradually shifts
  their focus from suppressing OOD overestimation to avoiding overly conservative
  learning from suboptimal behavior policies to improve generalization. However, most
  approaches explicitly delimit boundaries for OOD actions based on the support in
  the dataset, which can potentially impede the data near these boundaries from acquiring
  realistic estimates. This paper investigates how to loosen the rigid demarcation
  of OOD boundaries, adaptively extracting knowledge from empirical data to implicitly
  improve the modelâ€™s generalization to nearby unseen data. We introduce an adversarial
  data splitting (ADS) framework that enforces the model to generalize the distribution
  shifts simulated from the train/validation subsets splitting of the dataset. Specifically,
  ADS is modeled as a min-max optimization problem inspired by meta-learning and solved
  by iterating over the following two steps. First, we train the model on the train-subset
  to minimize its loss on the validation-subset. Then, we adversarially generate the
  "hardest" train/validation subsets with the maximum distribution shift, making the
  model incapable of generalization at that splitting. We derive a generalization
  error bound for theoretically understanding ADS and verify the effectiveness with
  extensive experiments. Code is available at https://github.com/DkING-lv6/ADS.
