title: 'HyperFields: Towards Zero-Shot Generation of NeRFs from Text'
openreview: 8STOjGCkfH
abstract: 'We introduce HyperFields, a method for generating text-conditioned Neural
  Radiance Fields (NeRFs) with a single forward pass and (optionally) some fine-tuning.
  Key to our approach are: (i) a dynamic hypernetwork, which learns a smooth mapping
  from text token embeddings to the space of NeRFs; (ii) NeRF distillation training,
  which distills scenes encoded in individual NeRFs into one dynamic hypernetwork.
  These techniques enable a single network to fit over a hundred unique scenes. We
  further demonstrate that HyperFields learns a more general map between text and
  NeRFs, and consequently is capable of predicting novel in-distribution and out-of-distribution
  scenes â€” either zero-shot or with a few finetuning steps. Finetuning HyperFields
  benefits from accelerated convergence thanks to the learned general map, and is
  capable of synthesizing novel scenes 5 to 10 times faster than existing neural optimization-based
  methods. Our ablation experiments show that both the dynamic architecture and NeRF
  distillation are critical to the expressivity of HyperFields.'
