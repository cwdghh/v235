title: O$n$ Learning Deep O($n$)-Equivariant Hyperspheres
openreview: pFWmHUdJE5
abstract: In this paper, we utilize hyperspheres and regular $n$-simplexes and propose
  an approach to learning deep features equivariant under the transformations of $n$D
  reflections and rotations, encompassed by the powerful group of O$(n)$. Namely,
  we propose O$(n)$-equivariant neurons with spherical decision surfaces that generalize
  to any dimension $n$, which we call Deep Equivariant Hyperspheres. We demonstrate
  how to combine them in a network that directly operates on the basis of the input
  points and propose an invariant operator based on the relation between two points
  and a sphere, which as we show, turns out to be a Gram matrix. Using synthetic and
  real-world data in $n$D, we experimentally verify our theoretical contributions
  and find that our approach is superior to the competing methods for O$(n)$-equivariant
  benchmark datasets (classification and regression), demonstrating a favorable speed/performance
  trade-off. The code is available on GitHub.
