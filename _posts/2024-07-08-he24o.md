title: 'DynSyn: Dynamical Synergistic Representation for Efficient Learning and Control
  in Overactuated Embodied Systems'
openreview: qOMQ0UGLYl
abstract: Learning an effective policy to control high-dimensional, overactuated systems
  is a significant challenge for deep reinforcement learning algorithms. Such control
  scenarios are often observed in the neural control of vertebrate musculoskeletal
  systems. The study of these control mechanisms will provide insights into the control
  of high-dimensional, overactuated systems. The coordination of actuators, known
  as muscle synergies in neuromechanics, is considered a presumptive mechanism that
  simplifies the generation of motor commands. The dynamical structure of a system
  is the basis of its function, allowing us to derive a synergistic representation
  of actuators. Motivated by this theory, we propose the <em>Dynamical Synergistic
  Representation (DynSyn)</em> algorithm. DynSyn aims to generate synergistic representations
  from dynamical structures and perform task-specific, state-dependent adaptation
  to the representations to improve motor control. We demonstrate DynSynâ€™s efficiency
  across various tasks involving different musculoskeletal models, achieving state-of-the-art
  sample efficiency and robustness compared to baseline algorithms. DynSyn generates
  interpretable synergistic representations that capture the essential features of
  dynamical structures and demonstrates generalizability across diverse motor tasks.
