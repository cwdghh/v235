title: End-to-End Neuro-Symbolic Reinforcement Learning with Textual Explanations
openreview: 0P3kaNluGj
abstract: Neuro-symbolic reinforcement learning (NS-RL) has emerged as a promising
  paradigm for explainable decision-making, characterized by the interpretability
  of symbolic policies. NS-RL entails structured state representations for tasks with
  visual observations, but previous methods cannot refine the structured states with
  rewards due to a lack of efficiency. Accessibility also remains an issue, as extensive
  domain knowledge is required to interpret symbolic policies. In this paper, we present
  a neuro-symbolic framework for jointly learning structured states and symbolic policies,
  whose key idea is to distill the vision foundation model into an efficient perception
  module and refine it during policy learning. Moreover, we design a pipeline to prompt
  GPT-4 to generate textual explanations for the learned policies and decisions, significantly
  reducing usersâ€™ cognitive load to understand the symbolic policies. We verify the
  efficacy of our approach on nine Atari tasks and present GPT-generated explanations
  for policies and decisions.
