title: Variational Partial Group Convolutions for Input-Aware Partial Equivariance
  of Rotations and Color-Shifts
openreview: yDXnXJE1RK
abstract: Group Equivariant CNNs (G-CNNs) have shown promising efficacy in various
  tasks, owing to their ability to capture hierarchical features in an equivariant
  manner. However, their equivariance is fixed to the symmetry of the whole group,
  limiting adaptability to diverse partial symmetries in real-world datasets, such
  as limited rotation symmetry of handwritten digit images and limited color-shift
  symmetry of flower images. Recent efforts address this limitation, one example being
  Partial G-CNN which restricts the output group space of convolution layers to break
  full equivariance. However, such an approach still fails to adjust equivariance
  levels across data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Variational Partial
  G-CNN (VP G-CNN), to capture varying levels of partial equivariance specific to
  each data instance. VP G-CNN redesigns the distribution of the output group elements
  to be conditioned on input data, leveraging variational inference to avoid overfitting.
  This enables the model to adjust its equivariance levels according to the needs
  of individual data points. Additionally, we address training instability inherent
  in discrete group equivariance models by redesigning the reparametrizable distribution.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of VP G-CNN on both toy and real-world datasets,
  including MNIST67-180, CIFAR10, ColorMNIST, and Flowers102. Our results show robust
  performance, even in uncertainty metrics.
