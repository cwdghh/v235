title: Graph-based Time Series Clustering for End-to-End Hierarchical Forecasting
openreview: nd47Za5jk5
abstract: Relationships among time series can be exploited as inductive biases in
  learning effective forecasting models. In hierarchical time series, relationships
  among subsets of sequences induce hard constraints (hierarchical inductive biases)
  on the predicted values. In this paper, we propose a graph-based methodology to
  unify relational and hierarchical inductive biases in the context of deep learning
  for time series forecasting. In particular, we model both types of relationships
  as dependencies in a pyramidal graph structure, with each pyramidal layer corresponding
  to a level of the hierarchy. By exploiting modern - trainable - graph pooling operators
  we show that the hierarchical structure, if not available as a prior, can be learned
  directly from data, thus obtaining cluster assignments aligned with the forecasting
  objective. A differentiable reconciliation stage is incorporated into the processing
  architecture, allowing hierarchical constraints to act both as an architectural
  bias as well as a regularization element for predictions. Simulation results on
  representative datasets show that the proposed method compares favorably against
  the state of the art.
