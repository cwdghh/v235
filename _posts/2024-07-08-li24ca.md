title: 'FedBAT: Communication-Efficient Federated Learning via Learnable Binarization'
openreview: x2zxPwCkAZ
abstract: Federated learning is a promising distributed machine learning paradigm
  that can effectively exploit large-scale data without exposing usersâ€™ privacy. However,
  it may incur significant communication overhead, thereby potentially impairing the
  training efficiency. To address this challenge, numerous studies suggest binarizing
  the model updates. Nonetheless, traditional methods usually binarize model updates
  in a post-training manner, resulting in significant approximation errors and consequent
  degradation in model accuracy. To this end, we propose <b>Federated Binarization-Aware
  Training (FedBAT)</b>, a novel framework that directly learns binary model updates
  during the local training process, thus inherently reducing the approximation errors.
  FedBAT incorporates an innovative binarization operator, along with meticulously
  designed derivatives to facilitate efficient learning. In addition, we establish
  theoretical guarantees regarding the convergence of FedBAT. Extensive experiments
  are conducted on four popular datasets. The results show that FedBAT significantly
  accelerates the convergence and exceeds the accuracy of baselines by up to 9%, even
  surpassing that of FedAvg in some cases.
