title: Optimal Kernel Choice for Score Function-based Causal Discovery
openreview: DYd4vyyhUu
abstract: Score-based methods have demonstrated their effectiveness in discovering
  causal relationships by scoring different causal structures based on their goodness
  of fit to the data. Recently, Huang et al. proposed a generalized score function
  that can handle general data distributions and causal relationships by modeling
  the relations in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The selection of an appropriate
  kernel within this score function is crucial for accurately characterizing causal
  relationships and ensuring precise causal discovery. However, the current method
  involves manual heuristic selection of kernel parameters, making the process tedious
  and less likely to ensure optimality. In this paper, we propose a kernel selection
  method within the generalized score function that automatically selects the optimal
  kernel that best fits the data. Specifically, we model the generative process of
  the variables involved in each step of the causal graph search procedure as a mixture
  of independent noise variables. Based on this model, we derive an automatic kernel
  selection method by maximizing the marginal likelihood of the variables involved
  in each search step. We conduct experiments on both synthetic data and real-world
  benchmarks, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms heuristic
  kernel selection methods.
