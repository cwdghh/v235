title: Causal Representation Learning Made Identifiable by Grouping of Observational
  Variables
openreview: SL6V527p1F
abstract: A topic of great current interest is Causal Representation Learning (CRL),
  whose goal is to learn a causal model for hidden features in a data-driven manner.
  Unfortunately, CRL is severely ill-posed since it is a combination of the two notoriously
  ill-posed problems of representation learning and causal discovery. Yet, finding
  practical identifiability conditions that guarantee a unique solution is crucial
  for its practical applicability. Most approaches so far have been based on assumptions
  on the latent causal mechanisms, such as temporal causality, or existence of supervision
  or interventions; these can be too restrictive in actual applications. Here, we
  show identifiability based on novel, weak constraints, which requires no temporal
  structure, intervention, nor weak supervision. The approach is based on assuming
  the observational mixing exhibits a suitable grouping of the observational variables.
  We also propose a novel self-supervised estimation framework consistent with the
  model, prove its statistical consistency, and experimentally show its superior CRL
  performances compared to the state-of-the-art baselines. We further demonstrate
  its robustness against latent confounders and causal cycles.
