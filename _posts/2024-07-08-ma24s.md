title: Correcting Diffusion-Based Perceptual Image Compression with Privileged End-to-End
  Decoder
openreview: 1WWpIEFdlk
abstract: The images produced by diffusion models can attain excellent perceptual
  quality. However, it is challenging for diffusion models to guarantee distortion,
  hence the integration of diffusion models and image compression models still needs
  more comprehensive explorations. This paper presents a diffusion-based image compression
  method that employs a privileged end-to-end decoder model as correction, which achieves
  better perceptual quality while guaranteeing the distortion to an extent. We build
  a diffusion model and design a novel paradigm that combines the diffusion model
  and an end-to-end decoder, and the latter is responsible for transmitting the privileged
  information extracted at the encoder side. Specifically, we theoretically analyze
  the reconstruction process of the diffusion models at the encoder side with the
  original images being visible. Based on the analysis, we introduce an end-to-end
  convolutional decoder to provide a better approximation of the score function $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_t}\log
  p(\mathbf{x}_t)$ at the encoder side and effectively transmit the combination. Experiments
  demonstrate the superiority of our method in both distortion and perception compared
  with previous perceptual compression methods.
