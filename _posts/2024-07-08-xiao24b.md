title: Category-Aware Active Domain Adaptation
openreview: axwrD8F1yq
abstract: Active domain adaptation has shown promising results in enhancing unsupervised
  domain adaptation (DA), by actively selecting and annotating a small amount of unlabeled
  samples from the target domain. Despite its effectiveness in boosting overall performance,
  the gain usually concentrates on the categories that are readily improvable, while
  challenging categories that demand the utmost attention are often overlooked by
  existing models. To alleviate this discrepancy, we propose a novel category-aware
  active DA method that aims to boost the adaptation for the individual category without
  adversely affecting others. Specifically, our approach identifies the unlabeled
  data that are most important for the recognition of the targeted category. Our method
  assesses the impact of each unlabeled sample on the recognition loss of the target
  data via the influence function, which allows us to directly evaluate the sample
  importance, without relying on indirect measurements used by existing methods. Comprehensive
  experiments and in-depth explorations demonstrate the efficacy of our method on
  category-aware active DA over three datasets.
