title: Improving Computational Complexity in Statistical Models with Local Curvature
  Information
openreview: KwgAThfxEd
abstract: It is known that when the statistical models are singular, i.e., the Fisher
  information matrix at the true parameter is degenerate, the fixed step-size gradient
  descent algorithm takes polynomial number of steps in terms of the sample size $n$
  to converge to a final statistical radius around the true parameter, which can be
  unsatisfactory for the practical application. To further improve that computational
  complexity, we consider utilizing the local curvature information for parameter
  estimation. Even though there is a rich literature in using the local curvature
  information for optimization, the statistical rate of these methods in statistical
  models, to the best of our knowledge, has not been studied rigorously. The major
  challenge of this problem is due to the non-convex nature of sample loss function.
  To shed light on these problems, we specifically study the normalized gradient descent
  (NormGD) algorithm, a variant of gradient descent algorithm whose step size is scaled
  by the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix of the empirical loss function,
  and deal with the aforementioned issue with a population-to-sample analysis. When
  the population loss function is homogeneous, the NormGD iterates reach a final statistical
  radius around the true parameter after a logarithmic number of iterations in terms
  of $n$. Therefore, for fixed dimension $d$, the NormGD algorithm achieves the optimal
  computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to reach the final statistical radius,
  which is cheaper than the complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^{\tau})$ of the fixed step-size
  gradient descent algorithm for some $\tau > 1$.
