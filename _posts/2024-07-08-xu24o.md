title: Meta-Reinforcement Learning Robust to Distributional Shift Via Performing Lifelong
  In-Context Learning
openreview: laIOUtstMs
abstract: A key challenge in Meta-Reinforcement Learning (meta-RL) is the task distribution
  shift, since the generalization ability of most current meta-RL methods is limited
  to tasks sampled from the training distribution. In this paper, we propose Posterior
  Sampling Bayesian Lifelong In-Context Reinforcement Learning (PSBL), which is robust
  to task distribution shift. PSBL meta-trains a variant of transformer to directly
  perform amortized inference about the Predictive Posterior Distribution (PPD) of
  the optimal policy. Once trained, the network can infer the PPD online with frozen
  parameters. The agent then samples actions from the approximate PPD to perform online
  exploration, which progressively reduces uncertainty and enhances performance in
  the interaction with the environment. This property is known as in-context learning.
  Experimental results demonstrate that PSBL significantly outperforms standard Meta
  RL methods both in tasks with sparse rewards and dense rewards when the test task
  distribution is strictly shifted from the training distribution.
