title: High-Probability Bound for Non-Smooth Non-Convex Stochastic Optimization with
  Heavy Tails
openreview: klKk9ETAyU
abstract: Recently, Cutkosky et al. introduce the online-to-non-convex framework,
  which utilizes online learning methods to solve non-smooth non-convex optimization
  problems, and achieves an $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3}\delta^{-1})$ gradient complexity
  for finding $(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary points. However, their results rely on
  the bounded variance assumption of stochastic gradients and only hold in expectation.
  To address these limitations, we investigate the case that stochastic gradients
  obey heavy-tailed distributions with finite $\mathfrak{p}$-th moments for some $\mathfrak{p}\in(1,2]$,
  and propose a novel algorithm which is able to identify a $(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary
  point with high probability, after consuming $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-\frac{2\mathfrak{p}-1}{\mathfrak{p}-1}}\delta^{-1})$
  stochastic gradients. The key idea is first incorporating the gradient clipping
  technique into the online-to-non-convex framework to produce a sequence of points,
  the averaged gradient norms of which is no greater than $\epsilon$. Then, we propose
  a validation method to select one $(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary point among the
  candidates. When gradient distributions have bounded variance, i.e., $\mathfrak{p}=2$,
  our result turns into $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3}\delta^{-1})$, which improves
  the existing $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-4}\delta^{-1})$ high-probability bound.
  When the objective is smooth, our algorithm can also find an $\epsilon$-stationary
  point with $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-\frac{3\mathfrak{p}-2}{\mathfrak{p}-1}})$
  gradient queries.
