title: 'Don’t trust your eyes: on the (un)reliability of feature visualizations'
openreview: s0Jvdolv2I
abstract: 'How do neural networks extract patterns from pixels? Feature visualizations
  attempt to answer this important question by visualizing highly activating patterns
  through optimization. Today, visualization methods form the foundation of our knowledge
  about the internal workings of neural networks, as a type of mechanistic interpretability.
  Here we ask: How reliable are feature visualizations? We start our investigation
  by developing network circuits that trick feature visualizations into showing arbitrary
  patterns that are completely disconnected from normal network behavior on natural
  input. We then provide evidence for a similar phenomenon occurring in standard,
  unmanipulated networks: feature visualizations are processed very differently from
  standard input, casting doubt on their ability to "explain" how neural networks
  process natural images. This can be used as a sanity check for feature visualizations.
  We underpin our empirical findings by theory proving that the set of functions that
  can be reliably understood by feature visualization is extremely small and does
  not include general black-box neural networks. Therefore, a promising way forward
  could be the development of networks that enforce certain structures in order to
  ensure more reliable feature visualizations.'
