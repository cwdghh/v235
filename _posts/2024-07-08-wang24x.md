title: Mollification Effects of Policy Gradient Methods
openreview: DA2AiCiCaM
abstract: 'Policy gradient methods have enabled deep reinforcement learning (RL) to
  approach challenging continuous control problems, even when the underlying systems
  involve highly nonlinear dynamics that generate complex non-smooth optimization
  landscapes. We develop a rigorous framework for understanding how policy gradient
  methods mollify non-smooth optimization landscapes to enable effective policy search,
  as well as the downside of it: while making the objective function smoother and
  easier to optimize, the stochastic objective deviates further from the original
  problem. We demonstrate the equivalence between policy gradient methods and solving
  backward heat equations. Following the ill-posedness of backward heat equations
  from PDE theory, we present a fundamental challenge to the use of policy gradient
  under stochasticity. Moreover, we make the connection between this limitation and
  the uncertainty principle in harmonic analysis to understand the effects of exploration
  with stochastic policies in RL. We also provide experimental results to illustrate
  both the positive and negative aspects of mollification effects in practice.'
