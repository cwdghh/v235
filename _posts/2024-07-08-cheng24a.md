title: Transformers Implement Functional Gradient Descent to Learn Non-Linear Functions
  In Context
openreview: ah1BlQcLv4
abstract: Many neural network architectures are known to be Turing Complete, and can
  thus, in principle implement arbitrary algorithms. However, Transformers are unique
  in that they can implement gradient-based learning algorithms <em>under simple parameter
  configurations</em>. This paper provides theoretical and empirical evidence that
  (non-linear) Transformers naturally learn to implement gradient descent <em>in function
  space</em>, which in turn enable them to learn non-linear functions in context.
  Our results apply to a broad class of combinations of non-linear architectures and
  non-linear in-context learning tasks. Additionally, we show that the optimal choice
  of non-linear activation depends in a natural way on the class of functions that
  need to be learned.
