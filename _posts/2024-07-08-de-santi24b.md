title: 'Global Reinforcement Learning : Beyond Linear and Convex Rewards via Submodular
  Semi-gradient Methods'
openreview: 0M2tNui8jX
abstract: In classic Reinforcement Learning (RL), the agent maximizes an additive
  objective of the visited states, e.g., a value function. Unfortunately, objectives
  of this type cannot model many real-world applications such as experiment design,
  exploration, imitation learning, and risk-averse RL to name a few. This is due to
  the fact that additive objectives disregard interactions between states that are
  crucial for certain tasks. To tackle this problem, we introduce <em>Global</em>
  RL (GRL), where rewards are <em>globally</em> defined over trajectories instead
  of <em>locally</em> over states. Global rewards can capture <em>negative interactions</em>
  among states, e.g., in exploration, via submodularity, <em>positive interactions</em>,
  e.g., synergetic effects, via supermodularity, while mixed interactions via combinations
  of them. By exploiting ideas from submodular optimization, we propose a novel algorithmic
  scheme that converts any GRL problem to a sequence of classic RL problems and solves
  it efficiently with curvature-dependent approximation guarantees. We also provide
  hardness of approximation results and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our method on several GRL instances.
