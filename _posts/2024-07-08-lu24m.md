title: Disguised Copyright Infringement of Latent Diffusion Models
openreview: q5Bg858Hef
abstract: Copyright infringement may occur when a generative model produces samples
  substantially similar to some copyrighted data that it had access to during the
  training phase. The notion of access usually refers to including copyrighted samples
  directly in the training dataset, which one may inspect to identify an infringement.
  We argue that such visual auditing largely overlooks a concealed copyright infringement,
  where one constructs a disguise that looks drastically different from the copyrighted
  sample yet still induces the effect of training Latent Diffusion Models on it. Such
  disguises only require indirect access to the copyrighted material and cannot be
  visually distinguished, thus easily circumventing the current auditing tools. In
  this paper, we provide a better understanding of such disguised copyright infringement
  by uncovering the disguises generation algorithm, the revelation of the disguises,
  and importantly, how to detect them to augment the existing toolbox. Additionally,
  we introduce a broader notion of acknowledgment for comprehending such indirect
  access.
