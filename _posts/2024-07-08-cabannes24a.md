title: Learning Associative Memories with Gradient Descent
openreview: A9fLbXLRTK
abstract: This work focuses on the training dynamics of one associative memory module
  storing outer products of token embeddings. We reduce this problem to the study
  of a system of particles, which interact according to properties of the data distribution
  and correlations between embeddings. Through theory and experiments, we provide
  several insights. In overparameterized regimes, we obtain logarithmic growth of
  the “classification margins.” Yet, we show that imbalance in token frequencies and
  memory interferences due to correlated embeddings lead to oscillatory transitory
  regimes. The oscillations are more pronounced with large step sizes, which can create
  benign loss spikes, although these learning rates speed up the dynamics and accelerate
  the asymptotic convergence. We also find that underparameterized regimes lead to
  suboptimal memorization schemes. Finally, we assess the validity of our findings
  on small Transformer models.
