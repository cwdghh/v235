title: 'Agnostic Interactive Imitation Learning: New Theory and Practical Algorithms'
openreview: WCwxFM7n5S
abstract: We study interactive imitation learning, where a learner interactively queries
  a demonstrating expert for action annotations, aiming to learn a policy that has
  performance competitive with the expert, using as few annotations as possible. We
  focus on the general agnostic setting where the expert demonstration policy may
  not be contained in the policy class used by the learner. We propose a new oracle-efficient
  algorithm MFTPL-P (abbreviation for Mixed Follow the Perturbed Leader with Poisson
  perturbations) with provable finite-sample guarantees, under the assumption that
  the learner is given access to samples from some “explorative” distribution over
  states. Our guarantees hold for any policy class, which is considerably broader
  than prior state of the art. We further propose Bootstrap-DAgger, a more practical
  variant that does not require additional sample access.
