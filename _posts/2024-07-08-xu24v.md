title: Robust Universal Adversarial Perturbations
openreview: Paw0BkPaTN
abstract: Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) are imperceptible, image-agnostic
  vectors that cause deep neural networks (DNNs) to misclassify inputs with high probability.
  In practical attack scenarios, adversarial perturbations may undergo transformations
  such as changes in pixel intensity, scaling, etc. before being added to DNN inputs.
  Existing methods do not create UAPs robust to these real-world transformations,
  thereby limiting their applicability in practical attack scenarios. In this work,
  we introduce and formulate UAPs robust against real-world transformations. We build
  an iterative algorithm using probabilistic robustness bounds and construct UAPs
  robust to transformations generated by composing arbitrary sub-differentiable transformation
  functions. We perform an extensive evaluation on the popular CIFAR-10 and ILSVRC
  2012 datasets measuring our UAPsâ€™ robustness under a wide range common, real-world
  transformations such as rotation, contrast changes, etc. We further show that by
  using a set of primitive transformations our method generalizes well to unseen transformations
  such as fog, JPEG compression, etc. Our results show that our method can generate
  UAPs up to 23% more robust than state-of-the-art baselines.
