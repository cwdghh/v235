title: 'MolCRAFT: Structure-Based Drug Design in Continuous Parameter Space'
openreview: KaAQu5rNU1
abstract: Generative models for structure-based drug design (SBDD) have shown promising
  results in recent years. Existing works mainly focus on how to generate molecules
  with higher binding affinity, ignoring the feasibility prerequisites for generated
  3D poses and resulting in <em>false positives</em>. We conduct thorough studies
  on key factors of ill-conformational problems when applying autoregressive methods
  and diffusion to SBDD, including mode collapse and hybrid continuous-discrete space.
  In this paper, we introduce MolCRAFT, the first SBDD model that operates in the
  continuous parameter space, together with a novel noise reduced sampling strategy.
  Empirical results show that our model consistently achieves superior performance
  in binding affinity with more stable 3D structure, demonstrating our ability to
  accurately model interatomic interactions. To our best knowledge, MolCRAFT is the
  first to achieve reference-level Vina Scores (-6.59 kcal/mol) with comparable molecular
  size, outperforming other strong baselines by a wide margin (-0.84 kcal/mol). Code
