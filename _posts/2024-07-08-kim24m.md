title: 'Double-Step Alternating Extragradient with Increasing Timescale Separation
  for Finding Local Minimax Points: Provable Improvements'
openreview: nUVForc3VP
abstract: In nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization, two-timescale gradient methods
  have shown their potential to find local minimax (optimal) points, provided that
  the timescale separation between the min and the max player is sufficiently large.
  However, existing two-timescale variants of gradient descent ascent and extragradient
  methods face two shortcomings, especially when we search for non-strict local minimax
  points that are prevalent in modern overparameterized setting. In specific, (1)
  these methods can be unstable at some non-strict local minimax points even with
  sufficiently large timescale separation, and even (2) computing a proper amount
  of timescale separation is infeasible in practice. To remedy these two issues, we
  propose to incorporate two simple but provably effective schemes, double-step alternating
  update and increasing timescale separation, into the two-timescale extragradient
  method, respectively. Under mild conditions, we show that the proposed methods converge
  to non-strict local minimax points that all existing two-timescale methods fail
  to converge.
