title: 'Size-invariance Matters: Rethinking Metrics and Losses for Imbalanced Multi-object
  Salient Object Detection'
openreview: 4HCi7JGCZk
abstract: This paper explores the size-invariance of evaluation metrics in Salient
  Object Detection (SOD), especially when multiple targets of diverse sizes co-exist
  in the same image. We observe that current metrics are size-sensitive, where larger
  objects are focused, and smaller ones tend to be ignored. We argue that the evaluation
  should be size-invariant because bias based on size is unjustified without additional
  semantic information. In pursuit of this, we propose a generic approach that evaluates
  each salient object separately and then combines the results, effectively alleviating
  the imbalance. We further develop an optimization framework tailored to this goal,
  achieving considerable improvements in detecting objects of different sizes. Theoretically,
  we provide evidence supporting the validity of our new metrics and present the generalization
  analysis of SOD. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
