title: Nash Incentive-compatible Online Mechanism Learning via Weakly Differentially
  Private Online Learning
openreview: QQkK6YH0Th
abstract: We study a multi-round mechanism design problem, where we interact with
  a set of agents over a sequence of rounds. We wish to design an incentive-compatible
  (IC) online learning scheme to maximize an application-specific objective within
  a given class of mechanisms, without prior knowledge of the agentsâ€™ type distributions.
  Even if each mechanism in this class is IC in a single round, if an algorithm naively
  chooses from this class on each round, the entire learning process may not be IC
  against non-myopic buyers who appear over multiple rounds. On each round, our method
  randomly chooses between the recommendation of a weakly differentially private online
  learning algorithm (e.g., Hedge), and a commitment mechanism which penalizes non-truthful
  behavior. Our method is IC and achieves $O(T^{\frac{1+h}{2}})$ regret for the application-specific
  objective in an adversarial setting, where $h$ quantifies the long-sightedness of
  the agents. When compared to prior work, our approach is conceptually simpler, it
  applies to general mechanism design problems (beyond auctions), and its regret scales
  gracefully with the size of the mechanism class.
