title: Path-Guided Particle-based Sampling
openreview: Kt4fwiuKqf
abstract: Particle-based Bayesian inference methods by sampling from a partition-free
  target (posterior) distribution, e.g., Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD),
  have attracted significant attention. We propose a path-guided particle-based sampling
  (PGPS) method based on a novel Log-weighted Shrinkage (LwS) density path linking
  an initial distribution to the target distribution. We propose to utilize a Neural
  network to learn a vector field motivated by the Fokker-Planck equation of the designed
  density path. Particles, initiated from the initial distribution, evolve according
  to the ordinary differential equation defined by the vector field. The distribution
  of these particles is guided along a density path from the initial distribution
  to the target distribution. The proposed LwS density path allows for an efficient
  search of modes of the target distribution while canonical methods fail. We theoretically
  analyze the Wasserstein distance of the distribution of the PGPS-generated samples
  and the target distribution due to approximation and discretization errors. Practically,
  the proposed PGPS-LwS method demonstrates higher Bayesian inference accuracy and
  better calibration ability in experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world
  Bayesian learning tasks, compared to baselines, such as SVGD and Langevin dynamics,
  etc.
