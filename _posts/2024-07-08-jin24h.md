title: Language Models as Semantic Indexers
openreview: sYeioWoF9u
abstract: Semantic identifier (ID) is an important concept in information retrieval
  that aims to preserve the semantics of objects such as documents and items inside
  their IDs. Previous studies typically adopt a two-stage pipeline to learn semantic
  IDs by first procuring embeddings using off-the-shelf text encoders and then deriving
  IDs based on the embeddings. However, each step introduces potential information
  loss, and there is usually an inherent mismatch between the distribution of embeddings
  within the latent space produced by text encoders and the anticipated distribution
  required for semantic indexing. It is non-trivial to design a method that can learn
  the documentâ€™s semantic representations and its hierarchical structure simultaneously,
  given that semantic IDs are discrete and sequentially structured, and the semantic
  supervision is deficient. In this paper, we introduce LMIndexer, a self-supervised
  framework to learn semantic IDs with a generative language model. We tackle the
  challenge of sequential discrete ID by introducing a semantic indexer capable of
  generating neural sequential discrete representations with progressive training
  and contrastive learning. In response to the semantic supervision deficiency, we
  propose to train the model with a self-supervised document reconstruction objective.
  We show the high quality of the learned IDs and demonstrate their effectiveness
  on three tasks including recommendation, product search, and document retrieval
  on five datasets from various domains. Code is available at https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/LMIndexer.
