title: 'Private Vector Mean Estimation in the Shuffle Model: Optimal Rates Require
  Many Messages'
openreview: PTGJOUlQ68
abstract: We study the problem of private vector mean estimation in the shuffle model
  of privacy where $n$ users each have a unit vector $v^{(i)} \in \mathbb{R}^d$. We
  propose a new multi-message protocol that achieves the optimal error using $O(\min(n\varepsilon^2,d))$
  messages per user. Moreover, we show that any (unbiased) protocol that achieves
  optimal error must require each user to send $\Omega(\min(n\varepsilon^2,d)/\log(n))$
  messages, demonstrating the optimality of our message complexity up to logarithmic
  factors. Additionally, we study the single-message setting and design a protocol
  that achieves mean squared error $O(dn^{d/(d+2)}\varepsilon^{-4/(d+2)})$. Moreover,
  we show that <em>any</em> single-message protocol must incur mean squared error
  $\Omega(dn^{d/(d+2)})$, showing that our protocol is optimal in the standard setting
  where $\varepsilon = \Theta(1)$. Finally, we study robustness to malicious users
  and show that malicious users can incur large additive error with a single shuffler.
