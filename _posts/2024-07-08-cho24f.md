title: Neurodegenerative Brain Network Classification via Adaptive Diffusion with
  Temporal Regularization
openreview: GTnn6bNE3j
abstract: 'Analysis of neurodegenerative diseases on brain connectomes is important
  in facilitating early diagnosis and predicting its onset. However, investigation
  of the progressive and irreversible dynamics of these diseases remains underexplored
  in cross-sectional studies as its diagnostic groups are considered independent.
  Also, as in many real-world graphs, brain networks exhibit intricate structures
  with both homophily and heterophily. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive
  Graph diffusion network with Temporal regularization (AGT). AGT introduces node-wise
  convolution to adaptively capture low (i.e., homophily) and high-frequency (i.e.,
  heterophily) characteristics within an optimally tailored range for each node. Moreover,
  AGT captures sequential variations within progressive diagnostic groups with a novel
  temporal regularization, considering the relative feature distance between the groups
  in the latent space. As a result, our proposed model yields interpretable results
  at both node-level and group-level. The superiority of our method is validated on
  two neurodegenerative disease benchmarks for graph classification: Alzheimer’s Disease
  Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI)
  datasets.'
