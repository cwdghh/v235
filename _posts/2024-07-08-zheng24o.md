title: Self-Infilling Code Generation
openreview: bV9yT24t9B
abstract: 'In this work, we introduce self-infilling code generation, a general framework
  that incorporates infilling operations into auto-regressive decoding. Our approach
  capitalizes on the observation that recent infilling-capable code language models
  can perform self-infilling: whereas conventional infilling is designed to fill in
  the middle based on a predefined prefix and suffix, self-infilling sequentially
  generates both such surrounding context and the infilled content. We utilize self-infilling
  to introduce novel interruption and looping mechanisms in conventional decoding,
  evolving it into a non-monotonic process. Interruptions allow for postponing the
  generation of specific code until a definitive suffix is established, enhancing
  control during decoding. Meanwhile, the looping mechanism, which leverages the complementary
  nature of self-infilling and left-to-right decoding, can iteratively update and
  synchronize each piece of generation cyclically. Extensive experiments across a
  variety of code generation benchmarks demonstrate that decoding with self-infilling
  not only improves the output quality but also regularizes the overall generation,
  which effectively mitigates potential degeneration and scaffolds code to be more
  consistent with intended functionality.'
