title: 'Sign is Not a Remedy: Multiset-to-Multiset Message Passing for Learning on
  Heterophilic Graphs'
openreview: dGDFZM018a
abstract: 'Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained significant attention as a powerful
  modeling and inference method, especially for homophilic graph-structured data.
  To empower GNNs in heterophilic graphs, where adjacent nodes exhibit dissimilar
  labels or features, Signed Message Passing (SMP) has been widely adopted. However,
  there is a lack of theoretical and empirical analysis regarding the limitations
  of SMP. In this work, we unveil the potential pitfalls of SMP and their remedies.
  We first identify two limitations of SMP: undesirable representation update for
  multi-hop neighbors and vulnerability against oversmoothing issues. To overcome
  these challenges, we propose a novel message-passing function called Multiset to
  Multiset GNN (M2M-GNN). Our theoretical analyses and extensive experiments demonstrate
  that M2M-GNN effectively alleviates the limitations of SMP, yielding superior performance
  in comparison.'
