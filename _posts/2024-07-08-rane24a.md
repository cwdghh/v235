title: 'Position: The Reasonable Person Standard for AI'
openreview: PQWVUbqQtQ
abstract: 'As AI systems are increasingly incorporated into domains where human behavior
  has set the norm, a challenge for AI governance and AI alignment research is to
  regulate their behavior in a way that is useful and constructive for society. One
  way to answer this question is to ask: how do we govern the human behavior that
  the models are emulating? To evaluate human behavior, the American legal system
  often uses the "Reasonable Person Standard." The idea of "reasonable" behavior comes
  up in nearly every area of law. The legal system often judges the actions of parties
  with respect to what a reasonable person would have done under similar circumstances.
  This paper argues that the reasonable person standard provides useful guidelines
  for the type of behavior we should develop, probe, and stress-test in models. It
  explains how reasonableness is defined and used in key areas of the law using illustrative
  cases, how the reasonable person standard could apply to AI behavior in each of
  these areas and contexts, and how our societal understanding of "reasonable" behavior
  provides useful technical goals for AI researchers.'
