title: 'Ditto: Quantization-aware Secure Inference of Transformers upon MPC'
openreview: ZzXNCQGzqT
abstract: Due to the rising privacy concerns on sensitive client data and trained
  models like Transformers, secure multi-party computation (MPC) techniques are employed
  to enable secure inference despite attendant overhead. Existing works attempt to
  reduce the overhead using more MPC-friendly non-linear function approximations.
  However, the integration of quantization widely used in plaintext inference into
  the MPC domain remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we propose the framework named
  Ditto to enable more efficient quantization-aware secure Transformer inference.
  Concretely, we first incorporate an MPC-friendly quantization into Transformer inference
  and employ a quantization-aware distillation procedure to maintain the model utility.
  Then, we propose novel MPC primitives to support the type conversions that are essential
  in quantization and implement the quantization-aware MPC execution of secure quantized
  inference. This approach significantly decreases both computation and communication
  overhead, leading to improvements in overall efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments
  on Bert and GPT2 models to evaluate the performance of Ditto. The results demonstrate
  that Ditto is about $3.14\sim 4.40\times$ faster than MPCFormer (ICLR 2023) and
  $1.44\sim 2.35\times$ faster than the state-of-the-art work PUMA with negligible
  utility degradation.
