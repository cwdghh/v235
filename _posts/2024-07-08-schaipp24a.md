title: 'MoMo: Momentum Models for Adaptive Learning Rates'
openreview: WvvkbWD1vL
abstract: Training a modern machine learning architecture on a new task requires extensive
  learning-rate tuning, which comes at a high computational cost. Here we develop
  new Polyak-type adaptive learning rates that can be used on top of any momentum
  method, and require less tuning to perform well. We first develop MoMo, a <b>Mo</b>mentum
  <b>Mo</b>del based adaptive learning rate for SGD-M (stochastic gradient descent
  with momentum). MoMo uses momentum estimates of the batch losses and gradients sampled
  at each iteration to build a model of the loss function. Our model also makes use
  of any known lower bound of the loss function by using truncation, e.g. most losses
  are lower-bounded by zero. The models is then approximately minimized at each iteration
  to compute the next step. We show how MoMo can be used in combination with any momentum-based
  method, and showcase this by developing MoMo-Adam - which is Adam with our new model-based
  adaptive learning rate. We show that MoMo attains a $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ convergence
  rate for convex problems with interpolation, needing knowledge of no problem-specific
  quantities other than the optimal value. Additionally, for losses with unknown lower
  bounds, we develop on-the-fly estimates of a lower bound, that are incorporated
  in our model. We demonstrate that MoMo and MoMo-Adam improve over SGD-M and Adam
  in terms of robustness to hyperparameter tuning for training image classifiers on
  MNIST, CIFAR, and Imagenet, for recommender systems on the Criteo dataset, for a
  transformer model on the translation task IWSLT14, and for a diffusion model.
