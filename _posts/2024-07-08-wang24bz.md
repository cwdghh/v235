title: A Hierarchical Adaptive Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning Framework for Multiplier
  Circuit Design
openreview: LGz7GaUSEB
abstract: Multiplier design—which aims to explore a large combinatorial design space
  to simultaneously optimize multiple conflicting objectives—is a fundamental problem
  in the integrated circuits industry. Although traditional approaches tackle the
  multi-objective multiplier optimization problem by manually designed heuristics,
  reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach to discover high-speed and
  area-efficient multipliers. However, the existing RL-based methods struggle to find
  Pareto-optimal circuit designs for all possible preferences, i.e., weights over
  objectives, in a sample-efficient manner. To address this challenge, we propose
  a novel hierarchical adaptive (HAVE) multi-task reinforcement learning framework.
  The hierarchical framework consists of a meta-agent to generate diverse multiplier
  preferences, and an adaptive multi-task agent to collaboratively optimize multipliers
  conditioned on the dynamic preferences given by the meta-agent. To the best of our
  knowledge, HAVE is the first to well approximate Pareto-optimal circuit designs
  for the entire preference space with high sample efficiency. Experiments on multipliers
  across a wide range of input widths demonstrate that HAVE significantly Pareto-dominates
  state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 28% larger hypervolume. Moreover, experiments
  demonstrate that multipliers designed by HAVE can well generalize to large-scale
  computation-intensive circuits.
