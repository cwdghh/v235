title: A Unified Linear Programming Framework for Offline Reward Learning from Human
  Demonstrations and Feedback
openreview: Olix9pk6nV
abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) and Reinforcement Learning from Human
  Feedback (RLHF) are pivotal methodologies in reward learning, which involve inferring
  and shaping the underlying reward function of sequential decision-making problems
  based on observed human demonstrations and feedback. Most prior work in reward learning
  has relied on prior knowledge or assumptions about decision or preference models,
  potentially leading to robustness issues. In response, this paper introduces a novel
  linear programming (LP) framework tailored for offline reward learning. Utilizing
  pre-collected trajectories without online exploration, this framework estimates
  a feasible reward set from the primal-dual optimality conditions of a suitably designed
  LP, and offers an optimality guarantee with provable sample efficiency. Our LP framework
  also enables aligning the reward functions with human feedback, such as pairwise
  trajectory comparison data, while maintaining computational tractability and sample
  efficiency. We demonstrate that our framework potentially achieves better performance
  compared to the conventional maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach through
  analytical examples and numerical experiments.
