title: Causally Motivated Personalized Federated Invariant Learning with Shortcut-Averse
  Information-Theoretic Regularization
openreview: Kbd9A4lVoX
abstract: Exploiting invariant relations and mitigating spurious correlation (a.k.a.,
  shortcut) between representation and target across varied data distributions can
  tackle the challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem. In personalized
  federated learning (PFL), heterogeneous data distribution across local clients offers
  the inherent prerequisites to extract the invariant features that maintain invariant
  relation with target. Nevertheless, personalized features are closely entangled
  with spurious features in PFL since they exhibit similar variability across different
  clients, which makes preserving personalization knowledge and eliminating shortcuts
  two conflicting objectives in PFL. To address the above challenge, we analyse the
  heterogeneous data generation on local clients through the lens of structured causal
  model and propose a crucial causal signature which can distinguish personalized
  features from spurious features with global invariant features as the anchor. Then
  the causal signature is quantified as an information-theoretic constraint that facilitates
  the shortcut-averse personalized invariant learning on each client. Theoretical
  analysis demonstrates our method, FedPIN, can yield a tighter bound on generalization
  error than the prevalent PFL approaches when train-test distribution shift exists
  on clients. Moreover, we provide a theoretical guarantee on the convergence rate
  of FedPIN in this paper. The results of extensive experiments show that our method
  can achieve superior OOD generalization performance compared with the state-of-the-art
  competitors.
