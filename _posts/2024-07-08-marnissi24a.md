title: 'A Unified View of FANOVA: A Comprehensive Bayesian Framework for Component
  Selection and Estimation'
openreview: dV9QGostQk
abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive Bayesian framework for FANOVA models.
  We provide guidelines for tuning and practical implementation to improve scalability
  of learning and prediction. Our model is very flexible and can handle different
  levels of sparsity across and within decomposition orders, as well as among covariates.
  This flexibility enables the modeling of complex real-world data while enhancing
  interpretability. Additionally, it allows our model to unify diverse deterministic
  and Bayesian non-parametric approaches into a single equation, making comparisons
  and understanding easier. Notably, our model serves as the Bayesian counterpart
  of several deterministic methods allowing uncertainty quantification. This general
  framework unlocks potential for novel model developments that have been previously
  overlooked, such as the proposed Dirichlet mixing model that addresses limitations
  of existing models.
