title: 'Riemannian Accelerated Zeroth-order Algorithm: Improved Robustness and Lower
  Query Complexity'
openreview: fPwWfoyxL1
abstract: Optimization problems with access to only zeroth-order information of the
  objective function on Riemannian manifolds arise in various applications, spanning
  from statistical learning to robot learning. While various zeroth-order algorithms
  have been proposed in Euclidean space, they are not inherently designed to handle
  the challenging constraints imposed by Riemannian manifolds. The proper adaptation
  of zeroth-order techniques to Riemannian manifolds remained unknown until the pioneering
  work of (Li et al., 2023a). However, zeroth-order algorithms are widely observed
  to converge slowly and be unstable in practice. To alleviate these issues, we propose
  a Riemannian accelerated zeroth-order algorithm with improved robustness. Regarding
  efficiency, our accelerated algorithm has the function query complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-7/4}d)$
  for finding an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order stationary point. By introducing
  a small perturbation, it exhibits a function query complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-7/4}d)$
  for seeking a second-order stationary point with a high probability, matching state-of-the-art
  result in Euclidean space. Moreover, we further establish the almost sure convergence
  in the asymptotic sense through the Stable Manifold Theorem. Regarding robustness,
  our algorithm requires larger smoothing parameters in the order of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{7/8}d^{-1/2})$,
  improving the existing result by a factor of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{3/4})$.
