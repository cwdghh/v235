title: Contrastive Representation for Data Filtering in Cross-Domain Offline Reinforcement
  Learning
openreview: rReWhol66R
abstract: Cross-domain offline reinforcement learning leverages source domain data
  with diverse transition dynamics to alleviate the data requirement for the target
  domain. However, simply merging the data of two domains leads to performance degradation
  due to the dynamics mismatch. Existing methods address this problem by measuring
  the dynamics gap via domain classifiers while relying on the assumptions of the
  transferability of paired domains. In this paper, we propose a novel representation-based
  approach to measure the domain gap, where the representation is learned through
  a contrastive objective by sampling transitions from different domains. We show
  that such an objective recovers the mutual-information gap of transition functions
  in two domains without suffering from the unbounded issue of the dynamics gap in
  handling significantly different domains. Based on the representations, we introduce
  a data filtering algorithm that selectively shares transitions from the source domain
  according to the contrastive score functions. Empirical results on various tasks
  demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance, using only 10% of the
  target data to achieve 89.2% of the performance on 100% target dataset with state-of-the-art
  methods.
