title: 'Gradient Compressed Sensing: A Query-Efficient Gradient Estimator for High-Dimensional
  Zeroth-Order Optimization'
openreview: vG7YpsJT74
abstract: We study nonconvex zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) in a high-dimensional
  space $\mathbb R^d$ for functions with approximately $s$-sparse gradients. To reduce
  the dependence on the dimensionality $d$ in the query complexity, high-dimensional
  ZOO methods seek to leverage gradient sparsity to design gradient estimators. The
  previous best method needs $O\big(s\log\frac ds\big)$ queries per step to achieve
  $O\big(\frac1T\big)$ rate of convergence w.r.t. the number T of steps. In this paper,
  we propose <em>Gradient Compressed Sensing</em> (GraCe), a query-efficient and accurate
  estimator for sparse gradients that uses only $O\big(s\log\log\frac ds\big)$ queries
  per step and still achieves $O\big(\frac1T\big)$ rate of convergence. To our best
  knowledge, we are the first to achieve a <em>double-logarithmic</em> dependence
  on $d$ in the query complexity under weaker assumptions. Our proposed GraCe generalizes
  the Indyk–Price–Woodruff (IPW) algorithm in compressed sensing from linear measurements
  to nonlinear functions. Furthermore, since the IPW algorithm is purely theoretical
  due to its impractically large constant, we improve the IPW algorithm via our <em>dependent
  random partition</em> technique together with our corresponding novel analysis and
  successfully reduce the constant by a factor of nearly $4300$. Our GraCe is not
  only theoretically query-efficient but also achieves strong empirical performance.
  We benchmark our GraCe against $12$ existing ZOO methods with $10000$-dimensional
  functions and demonstrate that GraCe significantly outperforms existing methods.
