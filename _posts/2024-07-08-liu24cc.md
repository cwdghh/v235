title: 'SPHINX-X: Scaling Data and Parameters for a Family of Multi-modal Large Language
  Models'
openreview: tDMlQkJRhZ
abstract: We propose SPHINX-X, an extensive Multi-modality Large Language Model (MLLM)
  series developed upon SPHINX. To improve the architecture and training efficiency,
  we modify the SPHINX framework by removing redundant visual encoders, bypassing
  fully-padded sub-images with skip tokens, and simplifying multi-stage training into
  a one-stage all-in-one paradigm. To fully unleash the potential of MLLMs, we assemble
  a comprehensive multi-domain and multi-modal dataset covering publicly available
  resources in language, vision, and vision-language tasks. We further enrich this
  collection with our curated OCR intensive and Set-of-Mark datasets, extending the
  diversity and generality. By training over different base LLMs including TinyLlama-1.1B,
  InternLM2-7B, LLaMA2-13B, and Mixtral-8$\times$7B, we obtain a spectrum of MLLMs
  that vary in parameter size and multilingual capabilities. Comprehensive benchmarking
  reveals a strong correlation between the multi-modal performance with the data and
  parameter scales. Code and models are released at https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/LLaMA2-Accessory.
