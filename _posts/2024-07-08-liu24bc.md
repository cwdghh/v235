title: Causal Discovery via Conditional Independence Testing with Proxy Variables
openreview: l1YbS3qkdk
abstract: Distinguishing causal connections from correlations is important in many
  scenarios. However, the presence of unobserved variables, such as the latent confounder,
  can introduce bias in conditional independence testing commonly employed in constraint-based
  causal discovery for identifying causal relations. To address this issue, existing
  methods introduced proxy variables to adjust for the bias caused by unobserveness.
  However, these methods were either limited to categorical variables or relied on
  strong parametric assumptions for identification. In this paper, we propose a novel
  hypothesis-testing procedure that can effectively examine the existence of the causal
  relationship over continuous variables, without any parametric constraint. Our procedure
  is based on discretization, which under completeness conditions, is able to asymptotically
  establish a linear equation whose coefficient vector is identifiable under the causal
  null hypothesis. Based on this, we introduce our test statistic and demonstrate
  its asymptotic level and power. We validate the effectiveness of our procedure using
  both synthetic and real-world data.
