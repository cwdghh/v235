title: 'Online Matching with Stochastic Rewards: Provable Better Bound via Adversarial
  Reinforcement Learning'
openreview: TujtZgdRxB
abstract: 'For a specific online optimization problem, for example, online bipartite
  matching (OBM), research efforts could be made in two directions before it is finally
  closed, i.e., the optimal competitive online algorithm is found. One is to continuously
  design algorithms with better performance. To this end, reinforcement learning (RL)
  has demonstrated great success in literature. However, little is known on the other
  direction: whether RL helps explore how hard an online problem is. In this paper,
  we study a generalized model of OBM, named online matching with stochastic rewards
  (OMSR, FOCS 2012), for which the optimal competitive ratio is still unknown. We
  adopt an adversarial RL approach that trains two RL agents adversarially and iteratively:
  the algorithm agent learns for algorithms with larger competitive ratios, while
  the adversarial agent learns to produce a family of hard instances. Through such
  a framework, agents converge at the end with a robust algorithm, which empirically
  outperforms the state of the art (STOC 2020). Much more significantly, it allows
  to track how the hard instances are generated. We succeed in distilling two structural
  properties from the learned graph patterns, which remarkably reduce the action space,
  and further enable theoretical improvement on the best-known hardness result of
  OMSR, from $0.621$ (FOCS 2012) to $0.597$. To the best of our knowledge, this gives
  the first evidence that RL can help enhance the theoretical understanding of an
  online problem.'
