title: Light and Optimal Schrödinger Bridge Matching
openreview: EWJn6hfZ4J
abstract: 'Schrödinger Bridges (SB) have recently gained the attention of the ML community
  as a promising extension of classic diffusion models which is also interconnected
  to the Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT). Recent solvers for SB exploit the pervasive
  bridge matching procedures. Such procedures aim to recover a stochastic process
  transporting the mass between distributions given only a transport plan between
  them. In particular, given the EOT plan, these procedures can be adapted to solve
  SB. This fact is heavily exploited by recent works giving rives to matching-based
  SB solvers. The cornerstone here is recovering the EOT plan: recent works either
  use heuristical approximations (e.g., the minibatch OT) or establish iterative matching
  procedures which by the design accumulate the error during the training. We address
  these limitations and propose a novel procedure to learn SB which we call the <b>optimal
  Schrödinger bridge matching</b>. It exploits the optimal parameterization of the
  diffusion process and provably recovers the SB process <b>(a)</b> with a single
  bridge matching step and <b>(b)</b> with arbitrary transport plan as the input.
  Furthermore, we show that the optimal bridge matching objective coincides with the
  recently discovered energy-based modeling (EBM) objectives to learn EOT/SB. Inspired
  by this observation, we develop a light solver (which we call LightSB-M) to implement
  optimal matching in practice using the Gaussian mixture parameterization of the
  adjusted Schrödinger potential. We experimentally showcase the performance of our
  solver in a range of practical tasks.'
