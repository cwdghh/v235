title: 'Adapting Static Fairness to Sequential Decision-Making: Bias Mitigation Strategies
  towards Equal Long-term Benefit Rate'
openreview: yUPBkPKzHw
abstract: Decisions made by machine learning models can have lasting impacts, making
  long-term fairness a critical consideration. It has been observed that ignoring
  the long-term effect and directly applying fairness criterion in static settings
  can actually worsen bias over time. To address biases in sequential decision-making,
  we introduce a long-term fairness concept named Equal Long-term Benefit Rate (ELBERT).
  This concept is seamlessly integrated into a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to consider
  the future effects of actions on long-term fairness, thus providing a unified framework
  for fair sequential decision-making problems. ELBERT effectively addresses the temporal
  discrimination issues found in previous long-term fairness notions. Additionally,
  we demonstrate that the policy gradient of Long-term Benefit Rate can be analytically
  simplified to standard policy gradients. This simplification makes conventional
  policy optimization methods viable for reducing bias, leading to our bias mitigation
  approach ELBERT-PO. Extensive experiments across various diverse sequential decision-making
  environments consistently reveal that ELBERT-PO significantly diminishes bias while
  maintaining high utility. Code is available at https://github.com/umd-huang-lab/ELBERT.
