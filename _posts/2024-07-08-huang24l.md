title: 'Bayesian Power Steering: An Effective Approach for Domain Adaptation of Diffusion
  Models'
openreview: QLOvxGwbIM
abstract: We propose a Bayesian framework for fine-tuning large diffusion models with
  a novel network structure called Bayesian Power Steering (BPS). We clarify the meaning
  behind adaptation from a large probability space to a small probability space and
  explore the task of fine-tuning pre-trained models using learnable modules from
  a Bayesian perspective. BPS extracts task-specific knowledge from a pre-trained
  modelâ€™s learned prior distribution. It efficiently leverages large diffusion models,
  differentially intervening different hidden features with a head-heavy and foot-light
  configuration. Experiments highlight the superiority of BPS over contemporary methods
  across a range of tasks even with limited amount of data. Notably, BPS attains an
  FID score of 10.49 under the sketch condition on the COCO17 dataset.
