title: Compositional Text-to-Image Generation with Dense Blob Representations
openreview: dMOhgHNYAf
abstract: Existing text-to-image models struggle to follow complex text prompts, raising
  the need for extra grounding inputs for better controllability. In this work, we
  propose to decompose a scene into visual primitives - denoted as dense blob representations
  - that contain fine-grained details of the scene while being modular, human-interpretable,
  and easy-to-construct. Based on blob representations, we develop a blob-grounded
  text-to-image diffusion model, termed BlobGEN, for compositional generation. Particularly,
  we introduce a new masked cross-attention module to disentangle the fusion between
  blob representations and visual features. To leverage the compositionality of large
  language models (LLMs), we introduce a new in-context learning approach to generate
  blob representations from text prompts. Our extensive experiments show that BlobGEN
  achieves superior zero-shot generation quality and better layout-guided controllability
  on MS-COCO. When augmented by LLMs, our method exhibits superior numerical and spatial
  correctness on compositional image generation benchmarks.
