title: Improving Interpretation Faithfulness for Vision Transformers
openreview: YdwwWRX20q
abstract: 'Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for
  various vision tasks. One reason behind the success lies in their ability to provide
  plausible innate explanations for the behavior of neural architectures. However,
  ViTs suffer from issues with explanation faithfulness, as their focal points are
  fragile to adversarial attacks and can be easily changed with even slight perturbations
  on the input image. In this paper, we propose a rigorous approach to mitigate these
  issues by introducing Faithful ViTs (FViTs). Briefly speaking, an FViT should have
  the following two properties: (1) The top-$k$ indices of its self-attention vector
  should remain mostly unchanged under input perturbation, indicating stable explanations;
  (2) The prediction distribution should be robust to perturbations. To achieve this,
  we propose a new method called Denoised Diffusion Smoothing (DDS), which adopts
  randomized smoothing and diffusion-based denoising. We theoretically prove that
  processing ViTs directly with DDS can turn them into FViTs. We also show that Gaussian
  noise is nearly optimal for both $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$-norm cases. Finally,
  we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments
  and evaluations. Results show that FViTs are more robust against adversarial attacks
  while maintaining the explainability of attention, indicating higher faithfulness.'
