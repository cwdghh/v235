title: 'PerceptAnon: Exploring the Human Perception of Image Anonymization Beyond
  Pseudonymization for GDPR'
openreview: 4BWCecFEcQ
abstract: Current image anonymization techniques, largely focus on localized pseudonymization,
  typically modify identifiable features like faces or full bodies and evaluate anonymity
  through metrics such as detection and re-identification rates. However, this approach
  often overlooks information present in the entire image post-anonymization that
  can compromise privacy, such as specific locations, objects/items, or unique attributes.
  Acknowledging the pivotal role of human judgment in anonymity, our study conducts
  a thorough analysis of perceptual anonymization, exploring its spectral nature and
  its critical implications for image privacy assessment, particularly in light of
  regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To facilitate
  this, we curated a dataset specifically tailored for assessing anonymized images.
  We introduce a learning-based metric, PerceptAnon, which is tuned to align with
  the human Perception of Anonymity. PerceptAnon evaluates both original-anonymized
  image pairs and solely anonymized images. Trained using human annotations, our metric
  encompasses both anonymized subjects and their contextual backgrounds, thus providing
  a comprehensive evaluation of privacy vulnerabilities. We envision this work as
  a milestone for understanding and assessing image anonymization, and establishing
  a foundation for future research. The codes and dataset are available in https://github.com/SonyResearch/gdpr_perceptanon.
