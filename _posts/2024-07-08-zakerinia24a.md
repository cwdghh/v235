title: More Flexible PAC-Bayesian Meta-Learning by Learning Learning Algorithms
openreview: pmsPKIBAu6
abstract: We introduce a new framework for studying meta-learning methods using PAC-Bayesian
  theory. Its main advantage over previous work is that it allows for more flexibility
  in how the transfer of knowledge between tasks is realized. For previous approaches,
  this could only happen indirectly, by means of learning prior distributions over
  models. In contrast, the new generalization bounds that we prove express the process
  of meta-learning much more directly as learning the learning algorithm that should
  be used for future tasks. The flexibility of our framework makes it suitable to
  analyze a wide range of meta-learning mechanisms and even design new mechanisms.
  Other than our theoretical contributions we also show empirically that our framework
  improves the prediction quality in practical meta-learning mechanisms.
