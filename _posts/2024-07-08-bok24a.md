title: Shifted Interpolation for Differential Privacy
openreview: KCVCFsPkrm
abstract: 'Noisy gradient descent and its variants are the predominant algorithms
  for differentially private machine learning. It is a fundamental question to quantify
  their privacy leakage, yet tight characterizations remain open even in the foundational
  setting of convex losses. This paper improves over previous analyses by establishing
  (and refining) the “privacy amplification by iteration” phenomenon in the unifying
  framework of $f$-differential privacy—which tightly captures all aspects of the
  privacy loss and immediately implies tighter privacy accounting in other notions
  of differential privacy, e.g., $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP and Rényi DP. Our key technical
  insight is the construction of <em>shifted interpolated processes</em> that unravel
  the popular shifted-divergences argument, enabling generalizations beyond divergence-based
  relaxations of DP. Notably, this leads to the first <em>exact</em> privacy analysis
  in the foundational setting of strongly convex optimization. Our techniques extend
  to many settings: convex/strongly convex, constrained/unconstrained, full/cyclic/stochastic
  batches, and all combinations thereof. As an immediate corollary, we recover the
  $f$-DP characterization of the exponential mechanism for strongly convex optimization
  in Gopi et al. (2022), and moreover extend this result to more general settings.'
