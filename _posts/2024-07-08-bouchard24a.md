title: Random matrix theory improved Fréchet mean of symmetric positive definite matrices
openreview: uQiFsBil3p
abstract: In this study, we consider the realm of covariance matrices in machine learning,
  particularly focusing on computing Fréchet means on the manifold of symmetric positive
  definite matrices, commonly referred to as Karcher or geometric means. Such means
  are leveraged in numerous machine learning tasks. Relying on advanced statistical
  tools, we introduce a random matrix theory based method that estimates Fréchet means,
  which is particularly beneficial when dealing with low sample support and a high
  number of matrices to average. Our experimental evaluation, involving both synthetic
  and real-world EEG and hyperspectral datasets, shows that we largely outperform
  state-of-the-art methods.
