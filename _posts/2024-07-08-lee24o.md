title: Drug Discovery with Dynamic Goal-aware Fragments
openreview: xuX2rDSSco
abstract: Fragment-based drug discovery is an effective strategy for discovering drug
  candidates in the vast chemical space, and has been widely employed in molecular
  generative models. However, many existing fragment extraction methods in such models
  do not take the target chemical properties into account or rely on heuristic rules.
  Additionally, the existing fragment-based generative models cannot update the fragment
  vocabulary with goal-aware fragments newly discovered during the generation. To
  this end, we propose a molecular generative framework for drug discovery, named
  <em>Goal-aware fragment Extraction, Assembly, and Modification</em> (GEAM). GEAM
  consists of three modules, each responsible for goal-aware fragment extraction,
  fragment assembly, and fragment modification. The fragment extraction module identifies
  important fragments contributing to the desired target properties with the information
  bottleneck principle, thereby constructing an effective goal-aware fragment vocabulary.
  Moreover, GEAM can explore beyond the initial vocabulary with the fragment modification
  module, and the exploration is further enhanced through the dynamic goal-aware vocabulary
  update. We experimentally demonstrate that GEAM effectively discovers drug candidates
  through the generative cycle of the three modules in various drug discovery tasks.
