title: Convergence Guarantees for the DeepWalk Embedding on Block Models
openreview: xwxUbBHC1q
abstract: Graph embeddings have emerged as a powerful tool for understanding the structure
  of graphs. Unlike classical spectral methods, recent methods such as DeepWalk, Node2Vec,
  etc. are based on solving nonlinear optimization problems on the graph, using local
  information obtained by performing random walks. These techniques have empirically
  been shown to produce “better” embeddings than their classical counterparts. However,
  due to their reliance on solving a nonconvex optimization problem, obtaining theoretical
  guarantees on the properties of the solution has remained a challenge, even for
  simple classes of graphs. In this work, we show convergence properties for the DeepWalk
  algorithm on graphs obtained from the Stochastic Block Model (SBM). Despite being
  simplistic, the SBM has proved to be a classic model for analyzing the behavior
  of algorithms on large graphs. Our results mirror the existing ones for spectral
  embeddings on SBMs, showing that even in the case of one-dimensional embeddings,
  the output of the DeepWalk algorithm provably recovers the cluster structure with
  high probability.
