abstract: 'Some neural language models (LMs) exhibit a remarkable capacity for in-context
  learning (ICL): they can fit predictors to datasets provided as input. While the
  mechanisms underlying ICL are well-studied in the context of synthetic problems
  like in-context linear regression, there is still some divergence between these
  model problems and the “real” ICL exhibited by LMs trained on large text corpora.
  In this paper, we study ICL through the lens of a new family of model problems we
  term in context language learning (ICLL). In ICLL, LMs are presented with a set
  of strings from a formal language, and must generate additional strings from the
  same language. We focus on in- context learning of regular languages generated by
  random finite automata. We evaluate a diverse set of neural sequence models on regular
  ICLL tasks. We first show that Transformers significantly outperform neural sequence
  models with recurrent or convolutional representations on ICLL tasks. Next, we provide
  evidence that they do so by computing in-context n-gram statistics using specialized
  attention heads. Finally, we show that hard-wiring these heads into neural models
  improves performance not just on synthetic ICLL, but natural language modeling,
  reducing the perplexity of 340M-parameter Transformers by up to 1.14 points (6.7%)
  on the SlimPajama dataset. Our results highlight the usefulness of in-context formal
  language learning as a tool for understanding ICL in models of natural text.'
