title: 'MC-GTA: Metric-Constrained Model-Based Clustering using Goodness-of-fit Tests
  with Autocorrelations'
openreview: ZzFTrzo0Cp
abstract: A wide range of (multivariate) temporal (1D) and spatial (2D) data analysis
  tasks, such as grouping vehicle sensor trajectories, can be formulated as clustering
  with given metric constraints. Existing metric-constrained clustering algorithms
  overlook the rich correlation between feature similarity and metric distance, i.e.,
  metric autocorrelation. The model-based variations of these clustering algorithms
  (e.g. TICC and STICC) achieve SOTA performance, yet suffer from computational instability
  and complexity by using a metric-constrained Expectation-Maximization procedure.
  In order to address these two problems, we propose a novel clustering algorithm,
  MC-GTA (<b>M</b>odel-based <b>C</b>lustering via <b>G</b>oodness-of-fit <b>T</b>ests
  with <b>A</b>utocorrelations). Its objective is only composed of pairwise weighted
  sums of feature similarity terms (square Wasserstein-2 distance) and metric autocorrelation
  terms (a novel multivariate generalization of classic semivariogram). We show that
  MC-GTA is effectively minimizing the total hinge loss for intra-cluster observation
  pairs not passing goodness-of-fit tests, i.e., statistically not originating from
  the same distribution. Experiments on 1D/2D synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
  that MC-GTA successfully incorporates metric autocorrelation. It outperforms strong
  baselines by large margins (up to 14.3% in ARI and 32.1% in NMI) with faster and
  stabler optimization ($>$10x speedup).
