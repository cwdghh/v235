title: Parameter-Dependent Competitive Analysis for Online Capacitated Coverage Maximization
  through Boostings and Attenuations
openreview: N1BPyf7wC2
abstract: 'In this paper, we consider a model called <em>Online Capacitated Coverage
  Maximization</em>, characterized by two features: (1) the dynamic arrival of online
  agents following a known identical and independent distribution, and (2) each offline
  agent is associated with a specific coverage valuation over the groundset of online
  agents. Additionally, both offline and online agents are assigned integer capacities,
  reflecting finite budgets and operational constraints. We introduce and analyze
  two matching policies. The first, a non-adaptive policy, utilizes offline statistics
  derived from solving a benchmark linear program. The second is an enhanced version
  equipped with real-time boostings and attenuations. We conduct a comprehensive competitive
  analysis and characterize the competitive ratio for both policies as functions of
  two crucial parameters: a lower bound on the matching capacity among offline agents
  and an upper bound on the number of online agents covering any specific feature
  for offline agents.'
