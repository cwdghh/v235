title: 'MALIBO: Meta-learning for Likelihood-free Bayesian Optimization'
openreview: 3QM5SWfeov
abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular method to optimize costly black-box
  functions, and meta-learning has emerged as a way to leverage knowledge from related
  tasks to optimize new tasks faster. However, existing meta-learning methods for
  BO rely on surrogate models that are not scalable or are sensitive to varying input
  scales and noise types across tasks. Moreover, they often overlook the uncertainty
  associated with task similarity, leading to unreliable task adaptation when a new
  task differs significantly or has not been sufficiently explored yet. We propose
  a novel meta-learning BO approach that bypasses the surrogate model and directly
  learns the utility of queries across tasks. It explicitly models task uncertainty
  and includes an auxiliary model to enable robust adaptation to new tasks. Extensive
  experiments show that our method achieves strong performance and outperforms multiple
  meta-learning BO methods across various benchmarks.
