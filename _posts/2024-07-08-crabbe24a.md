title: Time Series Diffusion in the Frequency Domain
openreview: W9GaJUVLCT
abstract: 'Fourier analysis has been an instrumental tool in the development of signal
  processing. This leads us to wonder whether this framework could similarly benefit
  generative modelling. In this paper, we explore this question through the scope
  of time series diffusion models. More specifically, we analyze whether representing
  time series in the frequency domain is a useful inductive bias for score-based diffusion
  models. By starting from the canonical SDE formulation of diffusion in the time
  domain, we show that a dual diffusion process occurs in the frequency domain with
  an important nuance: Brownian motions are replaced by what we call mirrored Brownian
  motions, characterized by mirror symmetries among their components. Building on
  this insight, we show how to adapt the denoising score matching approach to implement
  diffusion models in the frequency domain. This results in frequency diffusion models,
  which we compare to canonical time diffusion models. Our empirical evaluation on
  real-world datasets, covering various domains like healthcare and finance, shows
  that frequency diffusion models better capture the training distribution than time
  diffusion models. We explain this observation by showing that time series from these
  datasets tend to be more localized in the frequency domain than in the time domain,
  which makes them easier to model in the former case. All our observations point
  towards impactful synergies between Fourier analysis and diffusion models.'
