title: Causal Action Influence Aware Counterfactual Data Augmentation
openreview: 6Zl9rv6PDx
abstract: Offline data are both valuable and practical resources for teaching robots
  complex behaviors. Ideally, learning agents should not be constrained by the scarcity
  of available demonstrations, but rather generalize beyond the training distribution.
  However, the complexity of real-world scenarios typically requires huge amounts
  of data to prevent neural network policies from picking up on spurious correlations
  and learning non-causal relationships. We propose CAIAC, a data augmentation method
  that can create feasible synthetic transitions from a fixed dataset without having
  access to online environment interactions. By utilizing principled methods for quantifying
  causal influence, we are able to perform counterfactual reasoning by swapping $\textit{action}$-unaffected
  parts of the state-space between independent trajectories in the dataset. We empirically
  show that this leads to a substantial increase in robustness of offline learning
  algorithms against distributional shift.
