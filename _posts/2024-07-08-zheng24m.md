title: 'DPN: Decoupling Partition and Navigation for Neural Solvers of Min-max Vehicle
  Routing Problems'
openreview: ar174skI9u
abstract: 'The min-max vehicle routing problem (min-max VRP) traverses all given customers
  by assigning several routes and aims to minimize the length of the longest route.
  Recently, reinforcement learning (RL)-based sequential planning methods have exhibited
  advantages in solving efficiency and optimality. However, these methods fail to
  exploit the problem-specific properties in learning representations, resulting in
  less effective features for decoding optimal routes. This paper considers the sequential
  planning process of min-max VRPs as two coupled optimization tasks: customer partition
  for different routes and customer navigation in each route (i.e., partition and
  navigation). To effectively process min-max VRP instances, we present a novel attention-based
  Partition-and-Navigation encoder (P&N Encoder) that learns distinct embeddings for
  partition and navigation. Furthermore, we utilize an inherent symmetry in decoding
  routes and develop an effective agent-permutation-symmetric (APS) loss function.
  Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Decoupling-Partition-Navigation
  (DPN) method significantly surpasses existing learning-based methods in both single-depot
  and multi-depot min-max VRPs. Our code is available at'
