title: 'Tag-LLM: Repurposing General-Purpose LLMs for Specialized Domains'
openreview: LlqphyBdeT
abstract: 'Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
  understanding and generating natural language. However, their capabilities wane
  in highly specialized domains underrepresented in the pretraining corpus, such as
  physical and biomedical sciences. This work explores how to repurpose general LLMs
  into effective task solvers for specialized domains. We introduce a novel, model-agnostic
  framework for learning custom input tags, which are parameterized as continuous
  vectors appended to the LLM’s embedding layer, to condition the LLM. We design two
  types of input tags: domain tags are used to delimit specialized representations
  (e.g., chemical formulas) and provide domain-relevant context; function tags are
  used to represent specific functions (e.g., predicting molecular properties) and
  compress function-solving instructions. We develop a three-stage protocol to learn
  these tags using auxiliary data and domain knowledge. By explicitly disentangling
  task domains from task functions, our method enables zero-shot generalization to
  unseen problems through diverse combinations of the input tags. It also boosts LLM’s
  performance in various specialized domains, such as predicting protein or chemical
  properties and modeling drug-target interactions, outperforming expert models tailored
  to these tasks.'
