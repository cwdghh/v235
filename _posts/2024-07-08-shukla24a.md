title: 'TIC-TAC: A Framework For Improved Covariance Estimation In Deep Heteroscedastic
  Regression'
openreview: zdNTiTs5gU
abstract: 'Deep heteroscedastic regression involves jointly optimizing the mean and
  covariance of the predicted distribution using the negative log-likelihood. However,
  recent works show that this may result in sub-optimal convergence due to the challenges
  associated with covariance estimation. While the literature addresses this by proposing
  alternate formulations to mitigate the impact of the predicted covariance, we focus
  on improving the predicted covariance itself. We study two questions: (1) Does the
  predicted covariance truly capture the randomness of the predicted mean? (2) In
  the absence of supervision, how can we quantify the accuracy of covariance estimation?
  We address (1) with a <em>Taylor Induced Covariance (TIC)</em>, which captures the
  randomness of the predicted mean by incorporating its gradient and curvature through
  the second order Taylor polynomial. Furthermore, we tackle (2) by introducing a
  <em>Task Agnostic Correlations (TAC)</em> metric, which combines the notion of correlations
  and absolute error to evaluate the covariance. We evaluate TIC-TAC across multiple
  experiments spanning synthetic and real-world datasets. Our results show that not
  only does TIC accurately learn the covariance, it additionally facilitates an improved
  convergence of the negative log-likelihood. Our code is available at https://github.com/vita-epfl/TIC-TAC'
