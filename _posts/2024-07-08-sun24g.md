title: 'LSEnet: Lorentz Structural Entropy Neural Network for Deep Graph Clustering'
openreview: L6SRXG92s6
abstract: Graph clustering is a fundamental problem in machine learning. Deep learning
  methods achieve the state-of-the-art results in recent years, but they still cannot
  work without predefined cluster numbers. Such limitation motivates us to pose a
  more challenging problem of graph clustering with unknown cluster number. We propose
  to address this problem from a fresh perspective of graph information theory (i.e.,
  structural information). In the literature, structural information has not yet been
  introduced to deep clustering, and its classic definition falls short of discrete
  formulation and modeling node features. In this work, we first formulate a differentiable
  structural information (DSI) in the continuous realm, accompanied by several theoretical
  results. By minimizing DSI, we construct the optimal partitioning tree where densely
  connected nodes in the graph tend to have the same assignment, revealing the cluster
  struc- ture. DSI is also theoretically presented as a new graph clustering objective,
  not requiring the pre-defined cluster number. Furthermore, we design a neural LSEnet
  in the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space, where we integrate node features to structural
  information via manifold-valued graph convolution. Extensive empirical results on
  real graphs show the superiority of our approach.
