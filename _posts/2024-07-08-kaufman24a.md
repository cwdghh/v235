title: First-Order Manifold Data Augmentation for Regression Learning
openreview: geajNKab7g
abstract: 'Data augmentation (DA) methods tailored to specific domains generate synthetic
  samples by applying transformations that are appropriate for the characteristics
  of the underlying data domain, such as rotations on images and time warping on time
  series data. In contrast, <em>domain-independent</em> approaches, e.g. <em>mixup</em>,
  are applicable to various data modalities, and as such they are general and versatile.
  While regularizing classification tasks via DA is a well-explored research topic,
  the effect of DA on regression problems received less attention. To bridge this
  gap, we study the problem of domain-independent augmentation for regression, and
  we introduce <em>FOMA</em>: a new data-driven domain-independent data augmentation
  method. Essentially, our approach samples new examples from the tangent planes of
  the train distribution. Augmenting data in this way aligns with the network tendency
  towards capturing the dominant features of its input signals. We evaluate <em>FOMA</em>
  on in-distribution generalization and out-of-distribution robustness benchmarks,
  and we show that it improves the generalization of several neural architectures.
  We also find that strong baselines based on <em>mixup</em> are less effective in
  comparison to our approach. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/azencot-group/FOMA'
