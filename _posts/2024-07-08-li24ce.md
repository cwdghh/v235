title: PDHG-Unrolled Learning-to-Optimize Method for Large-Scale Linear Programming
openreview: 2cXzNDe614
abstract: 'Solving large-scale linear programming (LP) problems is an important task
  in various areas such as communication networks, power systems, finance and logistics.
  Recently, two distinct approaches have emerged to expedite LP solving: (i) First-order
  methods (FOMs); (ii) Learning to optimize (L2O). In this work, we propose an FOM-unrolled
  neural network (NN) called PDHG-Net, and propose a two-stage L2O method to solve
  large-scale LP problems. The new architecture PDHG-Net is designed by unrolling
  the recently emerged PDHG method into a neural network, combined with channel-expansion
  techniques borrowed from graph neural networks. We prove that the proposed PDHG-Net
  can recover PDHG algorithm, thus can approximate optimal solutions of LP instances
  with a polynomial number of neurons. We propose a two-stage inference approach:
  first use PDHG-Net to generate an approximate solution, and then apply PDHG algorithm
  to further improve the solution. Experiments show that our approach can significantly
  accelerate LP solving, achieving up to a 3$\times$ speedup compared to FOMs for
  large-scale LP problems.'
