title: Exploring the Low-Pass Filtering Behavior in Image Super-Resolution
openreview: 0f4u3Wg9zT
abstract: 'Deep neural networks for image super-resolution (ISR) have shown significant
  advantages over traditional approaches like the interpolation. However, they are
  often criticized as ’black boxes’ compared to traditional approaches with solid
  mathematical foundations. In this paper, we attempt to interpret the behavior of
  deep neural networks in ISR using theories from the field of signal processing.
  First, we report an intriguing phenomenon, referred to as ‘the sinc phenomenon.’
  It occurs when an impulse input is fed to a neural network. Then, building on this
  observation, we propose a method named Hybrid Response Analysis (HyRA) to analyze
  the behavior of neural networks in ISR tasks. Specifically, HyRA decomposes a neural
  network into a parallel connection of a linear system and a non-linear system and
  demonstrates that the linear system functions as a low-pass filter while the non-linear
  system injects high-frequency information. Finally, to quantify the injected high-frequency
  information, we introduce a metric for image-to-image tasks called Frequency Spectrum
  Distribution Similarity (FSDS). FSDS reflects the distribution similarity of different
  frequency components and can capture nuances that traditional metrics may overlook.
