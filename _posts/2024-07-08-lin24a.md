title: An Effective Dynamic Gradient Calibration Method for Continual Learning
openreview: q14AbM4kdv
abstract: Continual learning (CL) is a fundamental topic in machine learning, where
  the goal is to train a model with continuously incoming data and tasks. Due to the
  memory limit, we cannot store all the historical data, and therefore confront the
  “catastrophic forgetting” problem, i.e., the performance on the previous tasks can
  substantially decrease because of the missing information in the latter period.
  Though a number of elegant methods have been proposed, the catastrophic forgetting
  phenomenon still cannot be well avoided in practice. In this paper, we study the
  problem from the gradient perspective, where our aim is to develop an effective
  algorithm to calibrate the gradient in each updating step of the model; namely,
  our goal is to guide the model to be updated in the right direction under the situation
  that a large amount of historical data are unavailable. Our idea is partly inspired
  by the seminal stochastic variance reduction methods (e.g., SVRG and SAGA) for reducing
  the variance of gradient estimation in stochastic gradient descent algorithms. Another
  benefit is that our approach can be used as a general tool, which is able to be
  incorporated with several existing popular CL methods to achieve better performance.
  We also conduct a set of experiments on several benchmark datasets to evaluate the
  performance in practice.
