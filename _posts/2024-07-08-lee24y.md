title: Behavior Generation with Latent Actions
openreview: hoVwecMqV5
abstract: Generative modeling of complex behaviors from labeled datasets has been
  a longstanding problem in decision-making. Unlike language or image generation,
  decision-making requires modeling actions – continuous-valued vectors that are multimodal
  in their distribution, potentially drawn from uncurated sources, where generation
  errors can compound in sequential prediction. A recent class of models called Behavior
  Transformers (BeT) addresses this by discretizing actions using k-means clustering
  to capture different modes. However, k-means struggles to scale for high-dimensional
  action spaces or long sequences, and lacks gradient information, and thus BeT suffers
  in modeling long-range actions. In this work, we present Vector-Quantized Behavior
  Transformer (VQ-BeT), a versatile model for behavior generation that handles multimodal
  action prediction, conditional generation, and partial observations. VQ-BeT augments
  BeT by tokenizing continuous actions with a hierarchical vector quantization module.
  Across seven environments including simulated manipulation, autonomous driving,
  and robotics, VQ-BeT improves on state-of-the-art models such as BeT and Diffusion
  Policies. Importantly, we demonstrate VQ-BeT’s improved ability to capture behavior
  modes while accelerating inference speed 5× over Diffusion Policies. Videos can
