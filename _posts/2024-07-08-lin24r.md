openreview: RLENZ8pNnn
abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable instruction-following
  capabilities and achieved impressive performances in various applications. However,
  the performances of LLMs depend heavily on the instructions given to them, which
  are typically manually tuned with substantial human efforts. Recent work has used
  the query-efficient Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm to automatically optimize
  the instructions given to black-box LLMs. However, BO usually falls short when optimizing
  highly sophisticated (e.g., high-dimensional) objective functions, such as the functions
  mapping an instruction to the performance of an LLM. This is mainly due to the limited
  expressive power of the Gaussian process (GP) which is used by BO as a surrogate
  to model the objective function. Meanwhile, it has been repeatedly shown that neural
  networks (NNs), especially pre-trained transformers, possess strong expressive power
  and can model highly complex functions. So, we adopt a neural bandit algorithm which
  replaces the GP in BO by an NN surrogate to optimize instructions for black-box
  LLMs. More importantly, the neural bandit algorithm allows us to naturally couple
  the NN surrogate with the hidden representation learned by a pre-trained transformer
  (i.e., an open-source LLM), which significantly boosts its performance. These motivate
  us to propose our INSTruction optimization usIng Neural bandits Coupled with Transformers
  (INSTINCT) algorithm. We perform instruction optimization for ChatGPT and use extensive
  experiments to show that INSTINCT consistently outperforms baselines in different
  tasks, e.g., various instruction induction tasks and the task of improving zero-shot
  chain-of-thought instructions. Our code is available at https://github.com/xqlin98/INSTINCT.
