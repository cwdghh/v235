title: 'KernelSHAP-IQ: Weighted Least Square Optimization for Shapley Interactions'
openreview: d5jXW2H4gg
abstract: The Shapley value (SV) is a prevalent approach of allocating credit to machine
  learning (ML) entities to understand black box ML models. Enriching such interpretations
  with higher-order interactions is inevitable for complex systems, where the Shapley
  Interaction Index (SII) is a direct axiomatic extension of the SV. While it is well-known
  that the SV yields an optimal approximation of any game via a weighted least square
  (WLS) objective, an extension of this result to SII has been a long-standing open
  problem, which even led to the proposal of an alternative index. In this work, we
  characterize higher-order SII as a solution to a WLS problem, which constructs an
  optimal approximation via SII and k-Shapley values (k-SII). We prove this representation
  for the SV and pairwise SII and give empirically validated conjectures for higher
  orders. As a result, we propose KernelSHAP-IQ, a direct extension of KernelSHAP
  for SII, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for feature interactions.
