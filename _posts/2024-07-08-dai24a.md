title: 'Position: Beyond Personhood: Agency, Accountability, and the Limits of Anthropomorphic
  Ethical Analysis'
openreview: 4XlGXIh2BB
abstract: 'What is <em>agency,</em> and why does it matter? In this work, we draw
  from the political science and philosophy literature and give two competing visions
  of what it means to be an (ethical) agent. The first view, which we term <em>mechanistic</em>,
  is commonly— and implicitly—assumed in AI research, yet it is a fundamentally limited
  means to understand the ethical characteristics of AI. Under the second view, which
  we term volitional, AI can no longer be considered an ethical agent. We discuss
  the implications of each of these views for two critical questions: first, what
  the ideal system “ought” to look like, and second, how accountability may be achieved.
  In light of this discussion, we ultimately argue that, in the context of ethically-significant
  behavior, AI should be viewed not as an agent but as the outcome of political processes.'
