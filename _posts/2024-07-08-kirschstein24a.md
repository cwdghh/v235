title: The Merit of River Network Topology for Neural Flood Forecasting
openreview: QE6iC9s6vU
abstract: Climate change exacerbates riverine floods, which occur with higher frequency
  and intensity than ever. The much-needed forecasting systems typically rely on accurate
  river discharge predictions. To this end, the SOTA data-driven approaches treat
  forecasting at spatially distributed gauge stations as isolated problems, even within
  the same river network. However, incorporating the known topology of the river network
  into the prediction model has the potential to leverage the adjacency relationship
  between gauges. Thus, we model river discharge for a network of gauging stations
  with GNNs and compare the forecasting performance achieved by different adjacency
  definitions. Our results show that the model fails to benefit from the river network
  topology information, both on the entire network and small subgraphs. The learned
  edge weights correlate with neither of the static definitions and exhibit no regular
  pattern. Furthermore, the GNNs struggle to predict sudden, narrow discharge spikes.
  Our work hints at a more general underlying phenomenon of neural prediction not
  always benefitting from graphical structure and may inspire a systematic study of
  the conditions under which this happens.
