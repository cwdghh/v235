title: 'Piecewise Constant and Linear Regression Trees: An Optimal Dynamic Programming
  Approach'
openreview: rXnBvu5D7i
abstract: Regression trees are a human-comprehensible machine-learning model that
  can represent complex relationships. They are typically trained using greedy heuristics
  because computing optimal regression trees is NP-hard. Contrary to this standard
  practice, we consider optimal methods and improve the scalability of optimal methods
  by developing three new dynamic programming approaches. First, we improve the performance
  of a piecewise constant regression tree method using a special algorithm for trees
  of depth two. Second, we provide the first optimal dynamic programming method for
  piecewise multiple linear regression. Third, we develop the first optimal method
  for piecewise simple linear regression, for which we also provide a special algorithm
  for trees of depth two. The experimental results show that our methods improve scalability
  by one or more orders of magnitude over the state-of-the-art optimal methods while
  performing similarly or better in out-of-sample performance.
