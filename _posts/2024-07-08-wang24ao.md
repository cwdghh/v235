title: 'Connecting the Dots: Collaborative Fine-tuning for Black-Box Vision-Language
  Models'
openreview: jZEY5SxbL4
abstract: With the emergence of pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), considerable
  efforts have been devoted to fine-tuning them for downstream tasks. Despite the
  progress made in designing efficient fine-tuning methods, such methods require access
  to the modelâ€™s parameters, which can be challenging as model owners often opt to
  provide their models as a black box to safeguard model ownership. This paper proposes
  a <b>C</b>ollabo<b>ra</b>tive <b>F</b>ine-<b>T</b>uning (<b>CraFT</b>) approach
  for fine-tuning black-box VLMs to downstream tasks, where one only has access to
  the input prompts and the output predictions of the model. CraFT comprises two modules,
  a prompt generation module for learning text prompts and a prediction refinement
  module for enhancing output predictions in residual style. Additionally, we introduce
  an auxiliary prediction-consistent loss to promote consistent optimization across
  these modules. These modules are optimized by a novel collaborative training algorithm.
  Extensive experiments on few-shot classification over 15 datasets demonstrate the
  superiority of CraFT. The results show that CraFT achieves a decent gain of about
  12% with 16-shot datasets and only 8,000 queries. Moreover, CraFT trains faster
  and uses only about 1/80 of the memory footprint for deployment, while sacrificing
  only 1.62% compared to the white-box method. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/mrflogs/CraFT.
