title: Optimal Hessian/Jacobian-Free Nonconvex-PL Bilevel Optimization
openreview: eZiQWM5U0E
abstract: Bilevel optimization is widely applied in many machine learning tasks such
  as hyper-parameter learning, meta learning and reinforcement learning. Although
  many algorithms recently have been developed to solve the bilevel optimization problems,
  they generally rely on the (strongly) convex lower-level problems. More recently,
  some methods have been proposed to solve the nonconvex-PL bilevel optimization problems,
  where their upper-level problems are possibly nonconvex, and their lower-level problems
  are also possibly nonconvex while satisfying Polyak-≈Åojasiewicz (PL) condition.
  However, these methods still have a high convergence complexity or a high computation
  complexity such as requiring compute expensive Hessian/Jacobian matrices and its
  inverses. In the paper, thus, we propose an efficient Hessian/Jacobian-free method
  (i.e., HJFBiO) with the optimal convergence complexity to solve the nonconvex-PL
  bilevel problems. Theoretically, under some mild conditions, we prove that our HJFBiO
  method obtains an optimal convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{T})$, where $T$ denotes
  the number of iterations, and has an optimal gradient complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-1})$
  in finding an $\epsilon$-stationary solution. We conduct some numerical experiments
  on the bilevel PL game and hyper-representation learning task to demonstrate efficiency
  of our proposed method.
