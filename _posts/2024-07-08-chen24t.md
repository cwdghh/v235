title: 'Accelerated Policy Gradient: On the Convergence Rates of the Nesterov Momentum
  for Reinforcement Learning'
openreview: aeXRBnLoPP
abstract: 'Various acceleration approaches for Policy Gradient (PG) have been analyzed
  within the realm of Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, the theoretical understanding
  of the widely used momentum-based acceleration method on PG remains largely open.
  In response to this gap, we adapt the celebrated Nesterovâ€™s accelerated gradient
  (NAG) method to policy optimization in RL, termed <em>Accelerated Policy Gradient</em>
  (APG). To demonstrate the potential of APG in achieving fast convergence, we formally
  prove that with the true gradient and under the softmax policy parametrization,
  APG converges to an optimal policy at rates: (i) $\tilde{O}(1/t^2)$ with nearly
  constant step sizes; (ii) $O(e^{-ct})$ with time-varying step sizes. To the best
  of our knowledge, this is the first characterization of the convergence rates of
  NAG in the context of RL. Notably, our analysis relies on one interesting finding:
  Regardless of the parameter initialization, APG ends up entering a locally nearly-concave
  regime, where APG can significantly benefit from the momentum, within finite iterations.
  Through numerical validation and experiments on the Atari 2600 benchmarks, we confirm
  that APG exhibits a $\tilde{O}(1/t^2)$ rate with nearly constant step sizes and
  a linear convergence rate with time-varying step sizes, significantly improving
  convergence over the standard PG.'
