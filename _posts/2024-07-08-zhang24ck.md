title: On the Expressive Power of Spectral Invariant Graph Neural Networks
openreview: kmugaw9Kfq
abstract: Incorporating spectral information to enhance Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
  has shown promising results but raises a fundamental challenge due to the inherent
  ambiguity of eigenvectors. Various architectures have been proposed to address this
  ambiguity, referred to as spectral invariant architectures. Notable examples include
  GNNs and Graph Transformers that use spectral distances, spectral projection matrices,
  or other invariant spectral features. However, the potential expressive power of
  these spectral invariant architectures remains largely unclear. The goal of this
  work is to gain a deep theoretical understanding of the expressive power obtainable
  when using spectral features. We first introduce a novel message-passing framework
  for designing spectral invariant GNNs, called Eigenspace Projection GNN (EPNN).
  Our comprehensive analysis shows that EPNN essentially unifies all prior spectral
  invariant architectures, in that they are either strictly less expressive or equivalent
  to EPNN. A fine-grained expressiveness hierarchy among different architectures is
  also established. On the other hand, we present a surprising result that EPNN itself
  is bounded by a recently proposed class of Subgraph GNNs, implying that all these
  spectral invariant architectures are strictly less expressive than 3-WL. Finally,
  we demonstrate that these spectral features offer no additional advantage when combined
  with more expressive GNNs.
