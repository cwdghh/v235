title: 'How to Make the Gradients Small Privately: Improved Rates for Differentially
  Private Non-Convex Optimization'
openreview: XoSF46Pc2e
abstract: We provide a simple and flexible framework for designing differentially
  private algorithms to find approximate stationary points of non-convex loss functions.
  Our framework is based on using a private approximate risk minimizer to "warm start"
  another private algorithm for finding stationary points. We use this framework to
  obtain improved, and sometimes optimal, rates for several classes of non-convex
  loss functions. First, we obtain improved rates for finding stationary points of
  smooth non-convex empirical loss functions. Second, we specialize to quasar-convex
  functions, which generalize star-convex functions and arise in learning dynamical
  systems and training some neural nets. We achieve the optimal rate for this class.
  Third, we give an optimal algorithm for finding stationary points of functions satisfying
  the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) condition. For example, over-parameterized neural networks
  often satisfy this condition. Fourth, we provide new state-of-the-art rates for
  stationary points of non-convex population loss functions. Fifth, we obtain improved
  rates for non-convex generalized linear models. A modification of our algorithm
  achieves nearly the same rates for second-order stationary points of functions with
  Lipschitz Hessian, improving over the previous state-of-the-art for each of the
  above problems.
