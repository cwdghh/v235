title: 'On Gradient-like Explanation under a Black-box Setting: When Black-box Explanations
  Become as Good as White-box'
openreview: YB1O99gK7b
abstract: Attribution methods shed light on the explainability of data-driven approaches
  such as deep learning models by uncovering the most influential features in a to-be-explained
  decision. While determining feature attributions via gradients delivers promising
  results, the internal access required for acquiring gradients can be impractical
  under safety concerns, thus limiting the applicability of gradient-based approaches.
  In response to such limited flexibility, this paper presents GEEX (gradient-estimation-based
  explanation), a method that produces gradient-like explanations through only query-level
  access. The proposed approach holds a set of fundamental properties for attribution
  methods, which are mathematically rigorously proved, ensuring the quality of its
  explanations. In addition to the theoretical analysis, with a focus on image data,
  the experimental results empirically demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
  method over state-of-the-art black-box methods and its competitive performance compared
  to methods with full access.
