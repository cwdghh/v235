title: Fast White-Box Adversarial Streaming Without a Random Oracle
openreview: uaExqhJ2Ag
abstract: Recently, the question of adversarially robust streaming, where the stream
  is allowed to depend on the randomness of the streaming algorithm, has gained a
  lot of attention. In this work, we consider a strong white-box adversarial model
  (Ajtai et al. PODS 2022), in which the adversary has access to all past random coins
  and the parameters used by the streaming algorithm. We focus on the sparse recovery
  problem and extend our result to other tasks such as distinct element estimation
  and low-rank approximation of matrices and tensors. The main drawback of previous
  work is that it requires a <em>random oracle</em>, which is especially problematic
  in the streaming model since the amount of randomness is counted in the space complexity
  of a streaming algorithm. Also, the previous work suffers from large update time.
  We construct a near-optimal solution for the sparse recovery problem in white-box
  adversarial streams, based on the subexponentially secure Learning with Errors assumption.
  Importantly, our solution does not require a random oracle and has a polylogarithmic
  per item processing time. We also give results in a related white-box adversarially
  robust distributed model. Our constructions are based on homomorphic encryption
  schemes satisfying very mild structural properties that are currently satisfied
  by most known schemes.
