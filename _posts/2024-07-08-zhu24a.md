title: Iterative Search Attribution for Deep Neural Networks
openreview: 5ToHnqYxjB
abstract: 'Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance
  across various applications. However, ensuring the reliability and trustworthiness
  of DNNs requires enhanced interpretability of model inputs and outputs. As an effective
  means of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) research, the interpretability
  of existing attribution algorithms varies depending on the choice of reference point,
  the quality of adversarial samples, or the applicability of gradient constraints
  in specific tasks. To thoroughly explore the attribution integration paths, in this
  paper, inspired by the iterative generation of high-quality samples in the diffusion
  model, we propose an Iterative Search Attribution (ISA) method. To enhance attribution
  accuracy, ISA distinguishes the importance of samples during gradient ascent and
  descent, while clipping the relatively unimportant features in the model. Specifically,
  we introduce a scale parameter during the iterative process to ensure the features
  in next iteration are always more significant than those in current iteration. Comprehensive
  experimental results show that our method has superior interpretability in image
  recognition tasks compared with state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available
