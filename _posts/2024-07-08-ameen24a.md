title: Robust Graph Matching when Nodes are Corrupt
openreview: WJn1BAx9aj
abstract: Two models are introduced to study the problem of matching two correlated
  graphs when some of the nodes are corrupt. In the weak model, a random subset of
  nodes in one or both graphs can interact randomly with their network. For this model,
  it is shown that no estimator can correctly recover a positive fraction of the corrupt
  nodes. Necessary conditions for any estimator to correctly identify and match all
  the uncorrupt nodes are derived, and it is shown that these conditions are also
  sufficient for the k-core estimator. In the strong model, an adversarially selected
  subset of nodes in one or both graphs can interact arbitrarily with their network.
  For this model, detection of corrupt nodes is impossible. Even so, we show that
  if only one of the networks is compromised, then under appropriate conditions, the
  maximum overlap estimator can correctly match a positive fraction of nodes albeit
  without explicitly identifying them.
