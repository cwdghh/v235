title: Conditionally-Conjugate Gaussian Process Factor Analysis for Spike Count Data
  via Data Augmentation
openreview: zgiT3uxvCF
abstract: Gaussian process factor analysis (GPFA) is a latent variable modeling technique
  commonly used to identify smooth, low-dimensional latent trajectories underlying
  high-dimensional neural recordings. Specifically, researchers model spiking rates
  as Gaussian observations, resulting in tractable inference. Recently, GPFA has been
  extended to model spike count data. However, due to the non-conjugacy of the likelihood,
  the inference becomes intractable. Prior works rely on either black-box inference
  techniques, numerical integration or polynomial approximations of the likelihood
  to handle intractability. To overcome this challenge, we propose a conditionally-conjugate
  Gaussian process factor analysis (ccGPFA) resulting in both analytically and computationally
  tractable inference for modeling neural activity from spike count data. In particular,
  we develop a novel data augmentation based method that renders the model conditionally
  conjugate. Consequently, our model enjoys the advantage of simple closed-form updates
  using a variational EM algorithm. Furthermore, due to its conditional conjugacy,
  we show our model can be readily scaled using sparse Gaussian Processes and accelerated
  inference via natural gradients. To validate our method, we empirically demonstrate
  its efficacy through experiments.
