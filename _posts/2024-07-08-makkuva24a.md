title: 'LASER: Linear Compression in Wireless Distributed Optimization'
openreview: sDjszMb2Ir
abstract: 'Data-parallel SGD is the de facto algorithm for distributed optimization,
  especially for large scale machine learning. Despite its merits, communication bottleneck
  is one of its persistent issues. Most compression schemes to alleviate this either
  assume noiseless communication links, or fail to achieve good performance on practical
  tasks. In this paper, we close this gap and introduce <b>LASER</b>: <b>L</b>ine<b>A</b>r
  Compre<b>S</b>sion in Wir<b>E</b>less Dist<b>R</b>ibuted Optimization. LASER capitalizes
  on the inherent low-rank structure of gradients and transmits them efficiently over
  the noisy channels. Whilst enjoying theoretical guarantees similar to those of the
  classical SGD, LASER shows consistent gains over baselines on a variety of practical
  benchmarks. In particular, it outperforms the state-of-the-art compression schemes
  on challenging computer vision and GPT language modeling tasks. On the latter, we
  obtain 50-64% improvement in perplexity over our baselines for noisy channels.'
