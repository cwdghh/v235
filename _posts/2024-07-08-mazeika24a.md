title: 'HarmBench: A Standardized Evaluation Framework for Automated Red Teaming and
  Robust Refusal'
openreview: f3TUipYU3U
abstract: Automated red teaming holds substantial promise for uncovering and mitigating
  the risks associated with the malicious use of large language models (LLMs), yet
  the field lacks a standardized evaluation framework to rigorously assess new methods.
  To address this issue, we introduce HarmBench, a standardized evaluation framework
  for automated red teaming. We identify several desirable properties previously unaccounted
  for in red teaming evaluations and systematically design HarmBench to meet these
  criteria. Using HarmBench, we conduct a large-scale comparison of 18 red teaming
  methods and 33 target LLMs and defenses, yielding novel insights. We also introduce
  a highly efficient adversarial training method that greatly enhances LLM robustness
  across a wide range of attacks, demonstrating how HarmBench enables codevelopment
  of attacks and defenses. We open source HarmBench at https://github.com/centerforaisafety/HarmBench.
