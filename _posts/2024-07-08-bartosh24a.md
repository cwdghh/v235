title: Neural Diffusion Models
openreview: xzX7kf486K
abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable performance on many generative tasks.
  Despite recent success, most diffusion models are restricted in that they only allow
  linear transformation of the data distribution. In contrast, broader family of transformations
  can help train generative distributions more efficiently, simplifying the reverse
  process and closing the gap between the true negative log-likelihood and the variational
  approximation. In this paper, we present Neural Diffusion Models (NDMs), a generalization
  of conventional diffusion models that enables defining and learning time-dependent
  non-linear transformations of data. We show how to optimise NDMs using a variational
  bound in a simulation-free setting. Moreover, we derive a time-continuous formulation
  of NDMs, which allows fast and reliable inference using off-the-shelf numerical
  ODE and SDE solvers. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of NDMs through experiments
  on many image generation benchmarks, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, downsampled versions
  of ImageNet and CelebA-HQ. NDMs outperform conventional diffusion models in terms
  of likelihood, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet and CelebA-HQ, and
  produces high-quality samples.
