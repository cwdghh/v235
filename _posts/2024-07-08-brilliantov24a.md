title: 'Applying language models to algebraic topology: generating simplicial cycles
  using multi-labeling in Wu’s formula'
openreview: gQz30hTkRE
abstract: Computing homotopy groups of spheres has long been a fundamental objective
  in algebraic topology. Various theoretical and algorithmic approaches have been
  developed to tackle this problem. In this paper we take a step towards the goal
  of comprehending the group-theoretic structure of the generators of these homotopy
  groups by leveraging the power of machine learning. Specifically, in the simplicial
  group setting of Wu’s formula, we reformulate the problem of generating simplicial
  cycles as a problem of sampling from the intersection of algorithmic datasets related
  to Dyck languages. We present and evaluate language modelling approaches that employ
  multi-label information for input sequences, along with the necessary group-theoretic
  toolkit and non-neural baselines.
