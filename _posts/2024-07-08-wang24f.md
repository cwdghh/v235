title: Non-parametric Online Change Point Detection on Riemannian Manifolds
openreview: VW7Jk8KhNC
abstract: Non-parametric detection of change points in streaming time series data
  that belong to Euclidean spaces has been extensively studied in the literature.
  Nevertheless, when the data belongs to a Riemannian manifold, existing approaches
  are no longer applicable as they fail to account for the structure and geometry
  of the manifold. In this paper, we introduce a non-parametric algorithm for online
  change point detection in manifold-valued data streams. This algorithm monitors
  the generalized Karcher mean of the data, computed using stochastic Riemannian optimization.
  We provide theoretical bounds on the detection and false alarm rate performances
  of the algorithm, using a new result on the non-asymptotic convergence of the stochastic
  Riemannian gradient descent. We apply our algorithm to two different Riemannian
  manifolds. Experimental results with both synthetic and real data illustrate the
  performance of the proposed method.
