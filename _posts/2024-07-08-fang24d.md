title: 'BayOTIDE: Bayesian Online Multivariate Time Series Imputation with Functional
  Decomposition'
openreview: aGBpiEcB8z
abstract: 'In real-world scenarios such as traffic and energy management, we frequently
  encounter large volumes of time-series data characterized by missing values, noise,
  and irregular sampling patterns. While numerous imputation methods have been proposed,
  the majority tend to operate within a local horizon, which involves dividing long
  sequences into batches of fixed-length segments for model training. This local horizon
  often leads to the overlooking of global trends and periodic patterns. More importantly,
  most methods assume the observations are sampled at regular timestamps, and fail
  to handle complex irregular sampled time series in various applications. Additionally,
  most existing methods are learned in an offline manner. Thus, it is not suitable
  for applications with rapidly arriving streaming data. To address these challenges,
  we propose BayOTIDE: Bayesian Online Multivariate Time series Imputation with functional
  decomposition. Our method conceptualizes multivariate time series as the weighted
  combination of groups of low-rank temporal factors with different patterns. We employ
  a suite of Gaussian Processes (GPs),each with a unique kernel, as functional priors
  to model these factors. For computational efficiency, we further convert the GPs
  into a state-space prior by constructing an equivalent stochastic differential equation
  (SDE), and developing a scalable algorithm for online inference. The proposed method
  can not only handle imputation over arbitrary timestamps, but also offer uncertainty
  quantification and interpretability for the downstream application. We evaluate
  our method on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We release the code at https://github.com/xuangu-fang/BayOTIDE.'
