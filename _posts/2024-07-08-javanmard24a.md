title: 'PriorBoost: An Adaptive Algorithm for Learning from Aggregate Responses'
openreview: qawwyKqOkj
abstract: This work studies algorithms for learning from aggregate responses. We focus
  on the construction of aggregation sets (called <em>bags</em> in the literature)
  for event-level loss functions. We prove for linear regression and generalized linear
  models (GLMs) that the optimal bagging problem reduces to one-dimensional size-constrained
  $k$-means clustering. Further, we theoretically quantify the advantage of using
  curated bags over random bags. We then propose the $\texttt{PriorBoost}$ algorithm,
  which adaptively forms bags of samples that are increasingly homogeneous with respect
  to (unobserved) individual responses to improve model quality. We study label differential
  privacy for aggregate learning, and we also provide extensive experiments showing
  that $\texttt{PriorBoost}$ regularly achieves optimal model quality for event-level
  predictions, in stark contrast to non-adaptive algorithms.
