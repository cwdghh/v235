title: Deep Networks Always Grok and Here is Why
openreview: zMue490KMr
abstract: 'Grokking, or delayed generalization, is a phenomenon where generalization
  in a deep neural network (DNN) occurs long after achieving near zero training error.
  Previous studies have reported the occurrence of grokking in specific controlled
  settings, such as DNNs initialized with large-norm parameters or transformers trained
  on algorithmic datasets. We demonstrate that grokking is actually much more widespread
  and materializes in a wide range of practical settings, such as training of a convolutional
  neural network (CNN) on CIFAR10 or a Resnet on Imagenette. We introduce the new
  concept of delayed robustness, whereby a DNN groks adversarial examples and becomes
  robust, long after interpolation and/or generalization. We develop an analytical
  explanation for the emergence of both delayed generalization and delayed robustness
  based on the local complexity of a DNN’s input-output mapping. Our local complexity
  measures the density of so-called “linear regions’’ (aka, spline partition regions)
  that tile the DNN input space and serves as a utile progress measure for training.
  We provide the first evidence that, for classification problems, the linear regions
  undergo a phase transition during training whereafter they migrate away from the
  training samples (making the DNN mapping smoother there) and towards the decision
  boundary (making the DNN mapping less smooth there). Grokking occurs post phase
  transition as a robust partition of the input space thanks to the linearization
  of the DNN mapping around the training points. Web: https://bit.ly/grok-adversarial.'
