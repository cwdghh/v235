title: Learning Solution-Aware Transformers for Efficiently Solving Quadratic Assignment
  Problem
openreview: bBkQ51PmjC
abstract: Recently various optimization problems, such as Mixed Integer Linear Programming
  Problems (MILPs), have undergone comprehensive investigation, leveraging the capabilities
  of machine learning. This work focuses on learning-based solutions for efficiently
  solving the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAPs), which stands as a formidable challenge
  in combinatorial optimization. While many instances of simpler problems admit fully
  polynomial-time approximate solution (FPTAS), QAP is shown to be strongly NPhard.
  Even finding a FPTAS for QAP is difficult, in the sense that the existence of a
  FPTAS implies P = NP. Current research on QAPs suffer from limited scale and computational
  inefficiency. To attack the aforementioned issues, we here propose the first solution
  of its kind for QAP in the learn-to-improve category. This work encodes facility
  and location nodes separately, instead of forming computationally intensive association
  graphs prevalent in current approaches. This design choice enables scalability to
  larger problem sizes. Furthermore, a Solution AWare Transformer (SAWT) architecture
  integrates the incumbent solution matrix with the attention score to effectively
  capture higher-order information of the QAPs. Our modelâ€™s effectiveness is validated
  through extensive experiments on self-generated QAP instances of varying sizes and
  the QAPLIB benchmark.
