title: Automating the Selection of Proxy Variables of Unmeasured Confounders
openreview: VuoB86HiCL
abstract: Recently, interest has grown in the use of proxy variables of unobserved
  confounding for inferring the causal effect in the presence of unmeasured confounders
  from observational data. One difficulty inhibiting the practical use is finding
  valid proxy variables of unobserved confounding to a target causal effect of interest.
  These proxy variables are typically justified by background knowledge. In this paper,
  we investigate the estimation of causal effects among multiple treatments and a
  single outcome, all of which are affected by unmeasured confounders, within a linear
  causal model, without prior knowledge of the validity of proxy variables. To be
  more specific, we first extend the existing proxy variable estimator, originally
  addressing a single unmeasured confounder, to accommodate scenarios where multiple
  unmeasured confounders exist between the treatments and the outcome. Subsequently,
  we present two different sets of precise identifiability conditions for selecting
  valid proxy variables of unmeasured confounders, based on the second-order statistics
  and higher-order statistics of the data, respectively. Moreover, we propose two
  data-driven methods for the selection of proxy variables and for the unbiased estimation
  of causal effects. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the correctness of our proposed
  algorithms. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data show the
  effectiveness of the proposed approach.
