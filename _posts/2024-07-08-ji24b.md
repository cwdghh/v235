title: 'ACE: Off-Policy Actor-Critic with Causality-Aware Entropy Regularization'
openreview: 1puvYh729M
abstract: 'The varying significance of distinct primitive behaviors during the policy
  learning process has been overlooked by prior model-free RL algorithms. Leveraging
  this insight, we explore the causal relationship between different action dimensions
  and rewards to evaluate the significance of various primitive behaviors during training.
  We introduce a causality-aware entropy term that effectively identifies and prioritizes
  actions with high potential impacts for efficient exploration. Furthermore, to prevent
  excessive focus on specific primitive behaviors, we analyze the gradient dormancy
  phenomenon and introduce a dormancy-guided reset mechanism to further enhance the
  efficacy of our method. Our proposed algorithm, <b>ACE</b>: Off-policy <b>A</b>ctor-critic
  with <b>C</b>ausality-aware <b>E</b>ntropy regularization, demonstrates a substantial
  performance advantage across 29 diverse continuous control tasks spanning 7 domains
  compared to model-free RL baselines, which underscores the effectiveness, versatility,
  and efficient sample efficiency of our approach. Benchmark results and videos are
  available at https://ace-rl.github.io/.'
