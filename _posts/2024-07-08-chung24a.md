title: Sampling-based Multi-dimensional Recalibration
openreview: iJWeK2snMH
abstract: Calibration of probabilistic forecasts in the regression setting has been
  widely studied in the single dimensional case, where the output variables are assumed
  to be univariate. In many problem settings, however, the output variables are multi-dimensional,
  and in the presence of dependence across the output dimensions, measuring calibration
  and performing recalibration for each dimension separately can be both misleading
  and detrimental. In this work, we focus on representing predictive uncertainties
  via samples, and propose a recalibration method which accounts for the joint distribution
  across output dimensions to produce calibrated samples. Based on the concept of
  highest density regions (HDR), we define the notion of HDR calibration, and show
  that our recalibration method produces samples which are HDR calibrated. We demonstrate
  the performance of our method and the quality of the recalibrated samples on a suite
  of benchmark datasets in multi-dimensional regression, a real-world dataset in modeling
  plasma dynamics during nuclear fusion reactions, and on a decision-making application
  in forecasting demand.
