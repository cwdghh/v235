title: 'DeepPolar: Inventing Nonlinear Large-Kernel Polar Codes via Deep Learning'
openreview: iLfk2CwEHA
abstract: Progress in designing channel codes has been driven by human ingenuity and,
  fittingly, has been sporadic. Polar codes, developed on the foundation of Arikanâ€™s
  polarization kernel, represent the latest breakthrough in coding theory and have
  emerged as the state-of-the-art error-correction code for short-to-medium block
  length regimes. In an effort to automate the invention of good channel codes, especially
  in this regime, we explore a novel, non-linear generalization of Polar codes, which
  we call DeepPolar codes. DeepPolar codes extend the conventional Polar coding framework
  by utilizing a larger kernel size and parameterizing these kernels and matched decoders
  through neural networks. Our results demonstrate that these data-driven codes effectively
  leverage the benefits of a larger kernel size, resulting in enhanced reliability
  when compared to both existing neural codes and conventional Polar codes.
