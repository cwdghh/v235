title: A Rate-Distortion View of Uncertainty Quantification
openreview: zMGUDsPopK
abstract: In supervised learning, understanding an inputâ€™s proximity to the training
  data can help a model decide whether it has sufficient evidence for reaching a reliable
  prediction. While powerful probabilistic models such as Gaussian Processes naturally
  have this property, deep neural networks often lack it. In this paper, we introduce
  Distance Aware Bottleneck (DAB), i.e., a new method for enriching deep neural networks
  with this property. Building on prior information bottleneck approaches, our method
  learns a codebook that stores a compressed representation of all inputs seen during
  training. The distance of a new example from this codebook can serve as an uncertainty
  estimate for the example. The resulting model is simple to train and provides deterministic
  uncertainty estimates by a single forward pass. Finally, our method achieves better
  out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and misclassification prediction than prior
  methods, including expensive ensemble methods, deep kernel Gaussian Processes, and
  approaches based on the standard information bottleneck.
