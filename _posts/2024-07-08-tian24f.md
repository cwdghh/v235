title: Copula-Nested Spectral Kernel Network
openreview: aK1FyEP2Sn
abstract: Spectral Kernel Networks (SKNs) emerge as a promising approach in machine
  learning, melding solid theoretical foundations of spectral kernels with the representation
  power of hierarchical architectures. At its core, the spectral density function
  plays a pivotal role by revealing essential patterns in data distributions, thereby
  offering deep insights into the underlying framework in real-world tasks. Nevertheless,
  prevailing designs of spectral density often overlook the intricate interactions
  within data structures. This phenomenon consequently neglects expanses of the hypothesis
  space, thus curtailing the performance of SKNs. This paper addresses the issues
  through a novel approach, the <b>Co</b>pula-Nested Spectral <b>Ke</b>rnel <b>Net</b>work
  (<b>CokeNet</b>). Concretely, we first redefine the spectral density with the form
  of copulas to enhance the diversity of spectral densities. Next, the specific expression
  of the copula module is designed to allow the excavation of complex dependence structures.
  Finally, the unified kernel network is proposed by integrating the corresponding
  spectral kernel and the copula module. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and
  experimental verification, CokeNet demonstrates superior performance and significant
  advancements over SOTA algorithms in the field.
