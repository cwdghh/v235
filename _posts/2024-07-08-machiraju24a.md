title: 'Prospector Heads: Generalized Feature Attribution for Large Models & Data'
openreview: PjVqEErDgK
abstract: Feature attribution, the ability to localize regions of the input data that
  are relevant for classification, is an important capability for ML models in scientific
  and biomedical domains. Current methods for feature attribution, which rely on "explaining"
  the predictions of end-to-end classifiers, suffer from imprecise feature localization
  and are inadequate for use with small sample sizes and high-dimensional datasets
  due to computational challenges. We introduce prospector heads, an efficient and
  interpretable alternative to explanation-based attribution methods that can be applied
  to any encoder and any data modality. Prospector heads generalize across modalities
  through experiments on sequences (text), images (pathology), and graphs (protein
  structures), outperforming baseline attribution methods by up to 26.3 points in
  mean localization AUPRC. We also demonstrate how prospector heads enable improved
  interpretation and discovery of class-specific patterns in input data. Through their
  high performance, flexibility, and generalizability, prospectors provide a framework
  for improving trust and transparency for ML models in complex domains.
