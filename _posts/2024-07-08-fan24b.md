title: On the Convergence of Projected Bures-Wasserstein Gradient Descent under Euclidean
  Strong Convexity
openreview: VDgfJnOEMV
abstract: The Bures-Wasserstein (BW) gradient descent method has gained considerable
  attention in various domains, including Gaussian barycenter, matrix recovery and
  variational inference problems, due to its alignment with the Wasserstein geometry
  of normal distributions. Despite its popularity, existing convergence analysis are
  often contingent upon specific loss functions, and the exploration of constrained
  settings within this framework remains limited. In this work, we make an attempt
  to bridge this gap by providing a general convergence rate guarantee for BW gradient
  descent when the Euclidean strong convexity of the loss and the constraints is assumed.
  In an effort to advance practical implementations, we also derive a closed-form
  solution for the projection onto BW distance-constrained sets, which enables the
  fast implementation of projected BW gradient descent for problems that arise in
  the constrained barycenter and distributionally robust optimization literature.
  Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in computational efficiency
  and convergence speed, underscoring the efficacy of our method in practical scenarios.
