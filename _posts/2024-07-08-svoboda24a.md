title: 'Reinforcement Learning from Reachability Specifications: PAC Guarantees with
  Expected Conditional Distance'
openreview: mXUDDL4r1Q
abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) from temporal logical specifications is a fundamental
  problem in sequential decision making. One of the basic and core such specification
  is the reachability specification that requires a target set to be eventually visited.
  Despite strong empirical results for RL from such specifications, the theoretical
  guarantees are bleak, including the impossibility of Probably Approximately Correct
  (PAC) guarantee for reachability specifications. Given the impossibility result,
  in this work we consider the problem of RL from reachability specifications along
  with the information of expected conditional distance (ECD). We present (a) lower
  bound results which establish the necessity of ECD information for PAC guarantees
  and (b) an algorithm that establishes PAC-guarantees given the ECD information.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RL from reachability specifications
  that does not make any assumptions on the underlying environment to learn policies.
