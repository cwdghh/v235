title: 'DataFreeShield: Defending Adversarial Attacks without Training Data'
openreview: szvKJgmubh
abstract: 'Recent advances in adversarial robustness rely on an abundant set of training
  data, where using external or additional datasets has become a common setting. However,
  in real life, the training data is often kept private for security and privacy issues,
  while only the pretrained weight is available to the public. In such scenarios,
  existing methods that assume accessibility to the original data become inapplicable.
  Thus we investigate the pivotal problem of data-free adversarial robustness, where
  we try to achieve adversarial robustness without accessing any real data. Through
  a preliminary study, we highlight the severity of the problem by showing that robustness
  without the original dataset is difficult to achieve, even with similar domain datasets.
  To address this issue, we propose DataFreeShield, which tackles the problem from
  two perspectives: surrogate dataset generation and adversarial training using the
  generated data. Through extensive validation, we show that DataFreeShield outperforms
  baselines, demonstrating that the proposed method sets the first entirely data-free
  solution for the adversarial robustness problem.'
