title: High-Probability Convergence for Composite and Distributed Stochastic Minimization
  and Variational Inequalities with Heavy-Tailed Noise
openreview: DBI6AuCD4a
abstract: High-probability analysis of stochastic first-order optimization methods
  under mild assumptions on the noise has been gaining a lot of attention in recent
  years. Typically, gradient clipping is one of the key algorithmic ingredients to
  derive good high-probability guarantees when the noise is heavy-tailed. However,
  if implemented naively, clipping can spoil the convergence of the popular methods
  for composite and distributed optimization (Prox-SGD/Parallel SGD) even in the absence
  of any noise. Due to this reason, many works on high-probability analysis consider
  only unconstrained non-distributed problems, and the existing results for composite/distributed
  problems do not include some important special cases (like strongly convex problems)
  and are not optimal. To address this issue, we propose new stochastic methods for
  composite and distributed optimization based on the clipping of stochastic gradient
  differences and prove tight high-probability convergence results (including nearly
  optimal ones) for the new methods. In addition, we also develop new methods for
  composite and distributed variational inequalities and analyze the high-probability
  convergence of these methods.
