title: Floating Anchor Diffusion Model for Multi-motif Scaffolding
openreview: CtgJUQxmEo
abstract: Motif scaffolding seeks to design scaffold structures for constructing proteins
  with functions derived from the desired motif, which is crucial for the design of
  vaccines and enzymes. Previous works approach the problem by inpainting or conditional
  generation. Both of them can only scaffold motifs with fixed positions, and the
  conditional generation cannot guarantee the presence of motifs. However, prior knowledge
  of the relative motif positions in a protein is not readily available, and constructing
  a protein with multiple functions in one protein is more general and significant
  because of the synergies between functions. We propose a Floating Anchor Diffusion
  (FADiff) model. FADiff allows motifs to float rigidly and independently in the process
  of diffusion, which guarantees the presence of motifs and automates the motif position
  design. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of FADiff with high success rates
  and designable novel scaffolds. To the best of our knowledge, FADiff is the first
  work to tackle the challenge of scaffolding multiple motifs without relying on the
  expertise of relative motif positions in the protein. Code is available at https://github.com/aim-uofa/FADiff.
