title: Autaptic Synaptic Circuit Enhances Spatio-temporal Predictive Learning of Spiking
  Neural Networks
openreview: kAIkYOE5pV
abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) emulate the integrated-fire-leak mechanism
  found in biological neurons, offering a compelling combination of biological realism
  and energy efficiency. In recent years, they have gained considerable research interest.
  However, existing SNNs predominantly rely on the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF)
  model and are primarily suited for simple, static tasks. They lack the ability to
  effectively model long-term temporal dependencies and facilitate spatial information
  interaction, which is crucial for tackling complex, dynamic spatio-temporal prediction
  tasks. To tackle these challenges, this paper draws inspiration from the concept
  of autaptic synapses in biology and proposes a novel Spatio-Temporal Circuit (STC)
  model. The STC model integrates two learnable adaptive pathways, enhancing the spiking
  neuronsâ€™ temporal memory and spatial coordination. We conduct theoretical analysis
  of the dynamic parameters in the STC model, highlighting their contribution in establishing
  long-term memory and mitigating the issue of gradient vanishing. Through extensive
  experiments on multiple spatio-temporal prediction datasets, we demonstrate that
  our model outperforms other adaptive models. Furthermore, our model is compatible
  with existing spiking neuron models, thereby augmenting their dynamic representations.
  In essence, our work enriches the specificity and topological complexity of SNNs.
