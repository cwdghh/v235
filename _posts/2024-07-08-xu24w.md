title: Learning Exceptional Subgroups by End-to-End Maximizing KL-Divergence
openreview: AG45XqwPKU
abstract: Finding and describing sub-populations that are exceptional in terms of
  a target property has important applications in many scientific disciplines, from
  identifying disadvantaged demographic groups in census data to finding conductive
  molecules within gold nanoparticles. Current approaches to finding such subgroups
  require pre-discretized predictive variables, do not permit non-trivial target distributions,
  do not scale to large datasets, and struggle to find diverse results. To address
  these limitations, we propose SYFLOW, an end-to-end optimizable approach in which
  we leverage normalizing flows to model arbitrary target distributions and introduce
  a novel neural layer that results in easily interpretable subgroup descriptions.
  We demonstrate on synthetic data, real-world data, and via a case study, that SYFLOW
  reliably finds highly exceptional subgroups accompanied by insightful descriptions.
