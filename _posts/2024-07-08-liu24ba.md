title: Federated Representation Learning in the Under-Parameterized Regime
openreview: LIQYhV45D4
abstract: Federated representation learning (FRL) is a popular personalized federated
  learning (FL) framework where clients work together to train a common representation
  while retaining their personalized heads. Existing studies, however, largely focus
  on the over-parameterized regime. In this paper, we make the initial efforts to
  investigate FRL in the under-parameterized regime, where the FL model is insufficient
  to express the variations in all ground-truth models. We propose a novel FRL algorithm
  FLUTE, and theoretically characterize its sample complexity and convergence rate
  for linear models in the under-parameterized regime. To the best of our knowledge,
  this is the first FRL algorithm with provable performance guarantees in this regime.
  FLUTE features a data-independent random initialization and a carefully designed
  objective function that aids the distillation of subspace spanned by the global
  optimal representation from the misaligned local representations. On the technical
  side, we bridge low-rank matrix approximation techniques with the FL analysis, which
  may be of broad interest. We also extend FLUTE beyond linear representations. Experimental
  results demonstrate that FLUTE outperforms state-of-the-art FRL solutions in both
  synthetic and real-world tasks.
