title: Optimizing Watermarks for Large Language Models
openreview: QGAeWRRe6e
abstract: With the rise of large language models (LLMs) and concerns about potential
  misuse, watermarks for generative LLMs have recently attracted much attention. An
  important aspect of such watermarks is the trade-off between their identifiability
  and their impact on the quality of the generated text. This paper introduces a systematic
  approach to this trade-off in terms of a multi-objective optimization problem. For
  a large class of robust, efficient watermarks, the associated Pareto optimal solutions
  are identified and shown to outperform existing robust, efficient watermarks.
