title: Community-Invariant Graph Contrastive Learning
openreview: dskLpg8WFb
abstract: Graph augmentation has received great attention in recent years for graph
  contrastive learning (GCL) to learn well-generalized node/graph representations.
  However, mainstream GCL methods often favor randomly disrupting graphs for augmentation,
  which shows limited generalization and inevitably leads to the corruption of high-level
  graph information, i.e., the graph community. Moreover, current knowledge-based
  graph augmentation methods can only focus on either topology or node features, causing
  the model to lack robustness against various types of noise. To address these limitations,
  this research investigated the role of the graph community in graph augmentation
  and figured out its crucial advantage for learnable graph augmentation. Based on
  our observations, we propose a community-invariant GCL framework to maintain graph
  community structure during learnable graph augmentation. By maximizing the spectral
  changes, this framework unifies the constraints of both topology and feature augmentation,
  enhancing the modelâ€™s robustness. Empirical evidence on 21 benchmark datasets demonstrates
  the exclusive merits of our framework. Code is released on Github (https://github.com/ShiyinTan/CI-GCL.git).
