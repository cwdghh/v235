title: 'Observable Propagation: Uncovering Feature Vectors in Transformers'
openreview: ETNx4SekbY
abstract: 'A key goal of current mechanistic interpretability research in NLP is to
  find <em>linear features</em> (also called "feature vectors") for transformers:
  directions in activation space corresponding to concepts that are used by a given
  model in its computation. Present state-of-the-art methods for finding linear features
  require large amounts of labelled data – both laborious to acquire and computationally
  expensive to utilize. In this work, we introduce a novel method, called "observable
  propagation" (in short: ObProp), for finding linear features used by transformer
  language models in computing a given task – <em>using almost no data</em>. Our paradigm
  centers on the concept of "observables", linear functionals corresponding to given
  tasks. We then introduce a mathematical theory for the analysis of feature vectors,
  including a similarity metric between feature vectors called the <em>coupling coefficient</em>
  which estimates the degree to which one feature’s output correlates with another’s.
  We use ObProp to perform extensive qualitative investigations into several tasks,
  including gendered occupational bias, political party prediction, and programming
  language detection. Our results suggest that ObProp surpasses traditional approaches
  for finding feature vectors in the low-data regime, and that ObProp can be used
  to better understand the mechanisms responsible for bias in large language models.'
