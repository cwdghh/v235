title: 'Implicit Bias of AdamW: $\ell_∞$-Norm Constrained Optimization'
openreview: CmXkdlO6JJ
abstract: Adam with decoupled weight decay, also known as AdamW, is widely acclaimed
  for its superior performance in language modeling tasks, surpassing Adam with $\ell_2$
  regularization in terms of generalization and optimization. However, this advantage
  is not theoretically well-understood. One challenge here is that though intuitively
  Adam with $\ell_2$ regularization optimizes the $\ell_2$ regularized loss, it is
  not clear if AdamW optimizes a specific objective. In this work, we make progress
  toward understanding the benefit of AdamW by showing that it implicitly performs
  constrained optimization. More concretely, we show in the full-batch setting, if
  AdamW converges with any non-increasing learning rate schedule whose partial sum
  diverges, it must converge to a KKT point of the original loss under the constraint
  that the $\ell_\infty$ norm of the parameter is bounded by the inverse of the weight
  decay factor. This result is built on the observation that Adam can be viewed as
  a smoothed version of SignGD, which is the normalized steepest descent with respect
  to $\ell_\infty$ norm, and a surprising connection between normalized steepest descent
  with weight decay and Frank-Wolfe.
