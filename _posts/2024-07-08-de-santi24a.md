title: 'Geometric Active Exploration in Markov Decision Processes: the Benefit of
  Abstraction'
openreview: 2JYOxcGlRe
abstract: 'How can a scientist use a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to design
  experiments over a dynamical systemâ€™s state space? In the case of finite and Markovian
  systems, an area called <em>Active Exploration</em> (AE) relaxes the optimization
  problem of experiments design into Convex RL, a generalization of RL admitting a
  wider notion of reward. Unfortunately, this framework is currently not scalable
  and the potential of AE is hindered by the vastness of experiments spaces typical
  of scientific discovery applications. However, these spaces are often endowed with
  natural geometries, e.g., permutation invariance in molecular design, that an agent
  could leverage to improve the statistical and computational efficiency of AE. To
  achieve this, we bridge AE and MDP homomorphisms, which offer a way to exploit known
  geometric structures via abstraction. Towards this goal, we make two fundamental
  contributions: we extend MDP homomorphisms formalism to Convex RL, and we present,
  to the best of our knowledge, the first analysis that formally captures the benefit
  of abstraction via homomorphisms on sample efficiency. Ultimately, we propose the
  Geometric Active Exploration (GAE) algorithm, which we analyse theoretically and
  experimentally in environments motivated by problems in scientific discovery.'
