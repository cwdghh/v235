title: Stochastic positional embeddings improve masked image modeling
openreview: hr8OXXMb7a
abstract: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) is a promising self-supervised learning approach
  that enables learning from unlabeled images. Despite its recent success, learning
  good representations through MIM remains challenging because it requires predicting
  the right semantic content in accurate locations. For example, given an incomplete
  picture of a dog, we can guess that there is a tail, but we cannot determine its
  exact location. In this work, we propose to incorporate location uncertainty to
  MIM by using stochastic positional embeddings (StoP). Specifically, we condition
  the model on stochastic masked token positions drawn from a gaussian distribution.
  We show that using StoP reduces overfitting to location features and guides the
  model toward learning features that are more robust to location uncertainties. Quantitatively,
  using StoP improves downstream MIM performance on a variety of downstream tasks.
  For example, linear probing on ImageNet using ViT-B is improved by $+1.7%$, and
  by $2.5%$ for ViT-H using 1% of the data.
