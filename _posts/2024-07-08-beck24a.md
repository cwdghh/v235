title: Diffusion Tempering Improves Parameter Estimation with Probabilistic Integrators
  for Ordinary Differential Equations
openreview: 43HZG9zwaj
abstract: Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are widely used to describe dynamical
  systems in science, but identifying parameters that explain experimental measurements
  is challenging. In particular, although ODEs are differentiable and would allow
  for gradient-based parameter optimization, the nonlinear dynamics of ODEs often
  lead to many local minima and extreme sensitivity to initial conditions. We therefore
  propose diffusion tempering, a novel regularization technique for probabilistic
  numerical methods which improves convergence of gradient-based parameter optimization
  in ODEs. By iteratively reducing a noise parameter of the probabilistic integrator,
  the proposed method converges more reliably to the true parameters. We demonstrate
  that our method is effective for dynamical systems of different complexity and show
  that it obtains reliable parameter estimates for a Hodgkinâ€“Huxley model with a practically
  relevant number of parameters.
