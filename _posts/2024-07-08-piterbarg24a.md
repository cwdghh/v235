title: diff History for Neural Language Agents
openreview: TJCUrzhbiH
abstract: 'Neural Language Models (LMs) offer an exciting solution for general-purpose
  embodied control. However, a key technical issue arises when using an LM-based controller:
  environment observations must be converted to text, which coupled with history,
  results in long and verbose textual prompts. As a result, prior work in LM agents
  is limited to restricted domains with small observation size as well as minimal
  needs for interaction history or instruction finetuning. In this paper, we introduce
  diff history, a simple and highly effective solution to these issues. By applying
  the Unix diff command on consecutive text observations in the interaction histories
  used to prompt LM policies, we can both abstract away redundant information and
  focus the content of textual inputs on the salient changes in the environment. On
  NetHack, an unsolved video game that requires long-horizon reasoning for decision-making,
  LMs tuned with diff history match state-of-the-art performance for neural agents
  while needing 1800X fewer training examples compared to prior work. Even on the
  simpler BabyAI-Text environment with concise text observations, we find that although
  diff history increases the length of prompts, the representation it provides offers
  a 25% improvement in the efficiency of low-sample instruction finetuning. Further,
  we show that diff history scales favorably across different finetuning dataset sizes.
