title: New Bounds on the Cohesion of Complete-link and Other Linkage Methods for Agglomerative
  Clustering
openreview: gL5djEYLx2
abstract: Linkage methods are among the most popular algorithms for hierarchical clustering.
  Despite their relevance, the current knowledge regarding the quality of the clustering
  produced by these methods is limited. Here, we improve the currently available bounds
  on the maximum diameter of the clustering obtained by complete-link for metric spaces.
  One of our new bounds, in contrast to the existing ones, allows us to separate complete-link
  from single-link in terms of approximation for the diameter, which corroborates
  the common perception that the former is more suitable than the latter when the
  goal is producing compact clusters. We also show that our techniques can be employed
  to derive upper bounds on the cohesion of a class of linkage methods that includes
  the quite popular average-link.
