title: Privacy Preserving Adaptive Experiment Design
openreview: 1QmFKwVwwI
abstract: Adaptive experiment is widely adopted to estimate conditional average treatment
  effect (CATE) in clinical trials and many other scenarios. While the primary goal
  in experiment is to maximize estimation accuracy, due to the imperative of social
  welfare, it’s also crucial to provide treatment with superior outcomes to patients,
  which is measured by regret in contextual bandit framework. Furthermore, privacy
  concerns arise in clinical scenarios containing sensitive data like patients health
  records. Therefore, it’s essential for the treatment allocation mechanism to incorporate
  robust privacy protection measures. In this paper, we investigate the tradeoff between
  loss of social welfare and statistical power of CATE estimation in contextual bandit
  experiment. We propose a matched upper and lower bound for the multi-objective optimization
  problem, and then adopt the concept of Pareto optimality to mathematically characterize
  the optimality condition. Furthermore, we propose differentially private algorithms
  which still matches the lower bound, showing that privacy is "almost free". Additionally,
  we derive the asymptotic normality of the estimator, which is essential in statistical
  inference and hypothesis testing.
