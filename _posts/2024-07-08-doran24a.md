title: Spike Distance Function as a Learning Objective for Spike Prediction
openreview: limyQ1Kk0k
abstract: Approaches to predicting neuronal spike responses commonly use a Poisson
  learning objective. This objective quantizes responses into spike counts within
  a fixed summation interval, typically on the order of 10 to 100 milliseconds in
  duration; however, neuronal responses are often time accurate down to a few milliseconds,
  and Poisson models struggle to precisely model them at these timescales. We propose
  the concept of a spike distance function that maps points in time to the temporal
  distance to the nearest spike. We show that neural networks can be trained to approximate
  spike distance functions, and we present an efficient algorithm for inferring spike
  trains from the outputs of these models. Using recordings of chicken and frog retinal
  ganglion cells responding to visual stimuli, we compare the performance of our approach
  to that of Poisson models trained with various summation intervals. We show that
  our approach outperforms the use of Poisson models at spike train inference.
