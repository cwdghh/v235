title: Learning Optimal Deterministic Policies with Stochastic Policy Gradients
openreview: ABt0jlLZtX
abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods are successful approaches to deal with continuous
  reinforcement learning (RL) problems. They learn stochastic parametric (hyper)policies
  by either exploring in the space of actions or in the space of parameters. Stochastic
  controllers, however, are often undesirable from a practical perspective because
  of their lack of robustness, safety, and traceability. In common practice, stochastic
  (hyper)policies are learned only to deploy their deterministic version. In this
  paper, we make a step towards the theoretical understanding of this practice. After
  introducing a novel framework for modeling this scenario, we study the global convergence
  to the best deterministic policy, under (weak) gradient domination assumptions.
  Then, we illustrate how to tune the exploration level used for learning to optimize
  the trade-off between the sample complexity and the performance of the deployed
  deterministic policy. Finally, we quantitatively compare action-based and parameter-based
  exploration, giving a formal guise to intuitive results.
