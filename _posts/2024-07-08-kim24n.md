title: Scene Graph Generation Strategy with Co-occurrence Knowledge and Learnable
  Term Frequency
openreview: tTq3qMkJ8w
abstract: Scene graph generation (SGG) is an important task in image understanding
  because it represents the relationships between objects in an image as a graph structure,
  making it possible to understand the semantic relationships between objects intuitively.
  Previous SGG studies used a message-passing neural networks (MPNN) to update features,
  which can effectively reflect information about surrounding objects. However, these
  studies have failed to reflect the co-occurrence of objects during SGG generation.
  In addition, they only addressed the long-tail problem of the training dataset from
  the perspectives of sampling and learning methods. To address these two problems,
  we propose CooK, which reflects the Co-occurrence Knowledge between objects, and
  the learnable term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-$l$-IDF) to solve the
  long-tail problem. We applied the proposed model to the SGG benchmark dataset, and
  the results showed a performance improvement of up to 3.8% compared with existing
  state-of-the-art models in SGGen subtask. The proposed method exhibits generalization
  ability from the results obtained, showing uniform performance improvement for all
  MPNN models.
