title: 'FESSNC: Fast Exponentially Stable and Safe Neural Controller'
openreview: cVp8blEw2i
abstract: In order to stabilize nonlinear systems modeled by stochastic differential
  equations, we design a Fast Exponentially Stable and Safe Neural Controller (FESSNC)
  for fast learning controllers. Our framework is parameterized by neural networks,
  and realizing both rigorous exponential stability and safety guarantees. Concretely,
  we design heuristic methods to learn the exponentially stable and the safe controllers,
  respectively, in light of the classical theory of stochastic exponential stability
  and our established theorem on guaranteeing the almost-sure safety for stochastic
  dynamics. More significantly, to rigorously ensure the stability and the safety
  guarantees for the learned controllers, we develop a projection operator, projecting
  to the space of exponentially-stable and safe controllers. To reduce the highly
  computational cost for solving the projection operation, approximate projection
  operators are delicately proposed with closed forms that map the learned controllers
  to the target controller space. Furthermore, we employ Hutchinsonâ€™s trace estimator
  for a scalable unbiased estimate of the Hessian matrix that is used in the projection
  operator, which thus allows for reducing computational cost and, therefore, can
  accelerate the training and testing processes. More importantly, our approximate
  projection operations are applicable to the nonparametric control methods, improving
  their stability and safety performance. We empirically demonstrate the superiority
  of the FESSNC over the existing methods.
