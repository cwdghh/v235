title: Sampling in Unit Time with Kernel Fisher-Rao Flow
openreview: rtyqBfcg8j
abstract: We introduce a new mean-field ODE and corresponding interacting particle
  systems (IPS) for sampling from an unnormalized target density. The IPS are gradient-free,
  available in closed form, and only require the ability to sample from a reference
  density and compute the (unnormalized) target-to-reference density ratio. The mean-field
  ODE is obtained by solving a Poisson equation for a velocity field that transports
  samples along the geometric mixture of the two densities, $\pi_0^{1-t} \pi_1^t$,
  which is the path of a particular Fisher-Rao gradient flow. We employ a RKHS ansatz
  for the velocity field, which makes the Poisson equation tractable and enables discretization
  of the resulting mean-field ODE over finite samples. The mean-field ODE can be additionally
  be derived from a discrete-time perspective as the limit of successive linearizations
  of the Monge-Amp√®re equations within a framework known as sample-driven optimal
  transport. We introduce a stochastic variant of our approach and demonstrate empirically
  that our IPS can produce high-quality samples from varied target distributions,
  outperforming comparable gradient-free particle systems and competitive with gradient-based
  alternatives.
