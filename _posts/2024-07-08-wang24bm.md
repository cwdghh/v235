title: 'The Stronger the Diffusion Model, the Easier the Backdoor: Data Poisoning
  to Induce Copyright BreachesWithout Adjusting Finetuning Pipeline'
openreview: ZvFLbEPv6x
abstract: The commercialization of text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) brings forth
  potential copyright concerns. Despite numerous attempts to protect DMs from copyright
  issues, the vulnerabilities of these solutions are underexplored. In this study,
  we formalized the Copyright Infringement Attack on generative AI models and proposed
  a backdoor attack method, SilentBadDiffusion, to induce copyright infringement without
  requiring access to or control over training processes. Our method strategically
  embeds connections between pieces of copyrighted information and text references
  in poisoning data while carefully dispersing that information, making the poisoning
  data inconspicuous when integrated into a clean dataset. Our experiments show the
  stealth and efficacy of the poisoning data. When given specific text prompts, DMs
  trained with a poisoning ratio of 0.20% can produce copyrighted images. Additionally,
  the results reveal that the more sophisticated the DMs are, the easier the success
  of the attack becomes. These findings underline potential pitfalls in the prevailing
  copyright protection strategies and underscore the necessity for increased scrutiny
  to prevent the misuse of DMs.
