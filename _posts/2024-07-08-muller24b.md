title: Truly No-Regret Learning in Constrained MDPs
openreview: hrWte3nlzr
abstract: Constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) are a common way to model
  safety constraints in reinforcement learning. State-of-the-art methods for efficiently
  solving CMDPs are based on primal-dual algorithms. For these algorithms, all currently
  known regret bounds allow for <em>error cancellations</em> — one can compensate
  for a constraint violation in one round with a strict constraint satisfaction in
  another. This makes the online learning process unsafe since it only guarantees
  safety for the final (mixture) policy but not during learning. As Efroni et al.
  (2020) pointed out, it is an open question whether primal-dual algorithms can provably
  achieve sublinear regret if we do not allow error cancellations. In this paper,
  we give the first affirmative answer. We first generalize a result on last-iterate
  convergence of regularized primal-dual schemes to CMDPs with multiple constraints.
  Building upon this insight, we propose a model-based primal-dual algorithm to learn
  in an unknown CMDP. We prove that our algorithm achieves sublinear regret without
  error cancellations.
