title: Adaptively Learning to Select-Rank in Online Platforms
openreview: e5tA3Apbmy
abstract: Ranking algorithms are fundamental to various online platforms across e-commerce
  sites to content streaming services. Our research addresses the challenge of adaptively
  ranking items from a candidate pool for heterogeneous users, a key component in
  personalizing user experience. We develop a user response model that considers diverse
  user preferences and the varying effects of item positions, aiming to optimize overall
  user satisfaction with the ranked list. We frame this problem within a contextual
  bandits framework, with each ranked list as an action. Our approach incorporates
  an upper confidence bound to adjust predicted user satisfaction scores and selects
  the ranking action that maximizes these adjusted scores, efficiently solved via
  maximum weight imperfect matching. We demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a
  cumulative regret bound of $O(d\sqrt{NKT})$ for ranking $K$ out of $N$ items in
  a $d$-dimensional context space over $T$ rounds, under the assumption that user
  responses follow a generalized linear model. This regret alleviates dependence on
  the ambient action space, whose cardinality grows exponentially with $N$ and $K$
  (thus rendering direct application of existing adaptive learning algorithms – such
  as UCB or Thompson sampling – infeasible). Experiments conducted on both simulated
  and real-world datasets demonstrate our algorithm outperforms the baseline.
