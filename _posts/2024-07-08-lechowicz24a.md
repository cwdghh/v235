title: Chasing Convex Functions with Long-term Constraints
openreview: hRBdOHVn7y
abstract: We introduce and study a family of online metric problems with long-term
  constraints. In these problems, an online player makes decisions $\mathbf{x}_t$
  in a metric space $(X,d)$ to simultaneously minimize their hitting cost $f_t(\mathbf{x}_t)$
  and switching cost as determined by the metric. Over the time horizon $T$, the player
  must satisfy a long-term demand constraint $\sum_t c(\mathbf{x}_t) \geq 1$, where
  $c(\mathbf{x}_t)$ denotes the fraction of demand satisfied at time $t$. Such problems
  can find a wide array of applications to online resource allocation in sustainable
  energy/computing systems. We devise optimal competitive and learning-augmented algorithms
  for the case of bounded hitting cost gradients and weighted $\ell_1$ metrics, and
  further show that our proposed algorithms perform well in numerical experiments.
