title: 'MAGNOLIA: Matching Algorithms via GNNs for Online Value-to-go Approximation'
openreview: XlgeQ47Ra9
abstract: Online Bayesian bipartite matching is a central problem in digital marketplaces
  and exchanges, including advertising, crowdsourcing, ridesharing, and kidney exchange.
  We introduce a graph neural network (GNN) approach that emulates the problem’s combinatorially-complex
  optimal online algorithm, which selects actions (e.g., which nodes to match) by
  computing each action’s <em>value-to-go (VTG)</em>—the expected weight of the final
  matching if the algorithm takes that action, then acts optimally in the future.
  We train a GNN to estimate VTG and show empirically that this GNN returns high-weight
  matchings across a variety of tasks. Moreover, we identify a common family of graph
  distributions in spatial crowdsourcing applications, such as rideshare, under which
  VTG can be efficiently approximated by aggregating information within local neighborhoods
  in the graphs. This structure matches the local behavior of GNNs, providing theoretical
  justification for our approach.
