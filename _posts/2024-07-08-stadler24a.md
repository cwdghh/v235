title: The Fundamental Limits of Least-Privilege Learning
openreview: ZGEICuuUJo
abstract: 'The promise of least-privilege learning – to find feature representations
  that are useful for a learning task but prevent inference of any sensitive information
  unrelated to this task – is highly appealing. However, so far this concept has only
  been stated informally. It thus remains an open question whether and how we can
  achieve this goal. In this work, we provide the <em>first formalisation of the least-privilege
  principle for machine learning</em> and characterise its feasibility. We prove that
  there is a <em>fundamental trade-off</em> between a representation’s utility for
  a given task and its leakage beyond the intended task: it is not possible to learn
  representations that have high utility for the intended task but, at the same time,
  prevent inference of any attribute other than the task label itself. This trade-off
  holds <em>regardless</em> of the technique used to learn the feature mappings that
  produce these representations. We empirically validate this result for a wide range
  of learning techniques, model architectures, and datasets.'
