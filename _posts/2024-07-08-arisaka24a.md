title: Accelerating Legacy Numerical Solvers by Non-intrusive Gradient-based Meta-solving
openreview: yh6Y7ppf46
abstract: Scientific computing is an essential tool for scientific discovery and engineering
  design, and its computational cost is always a main concern in practice. To accelerate
  scientific computing, it is a promising approach to use machine learning (especially
  meta-learning) techniques for selecting hyperparameters of traditional numerical
  methods. There have been numerous proposals to this direction, but many of them
  require automatic-differentiable numerical methods. However, in reality, many practical
  applications still depend on well-established but non-automatic-differentiable legacy
  codes, which prevents practitioners from applying the state-of-the-art research
  to their own problems. To resolve this problem, we propose a non-intrusive methodology
  with a novel gradient estimation technique to combine machine learning and legacy
  numerical codes without any modification. We theoretically and numerically show
  the advantage of the proposed method over other baselines and present applications
  of accelerating established non-automatic-differentiable numerical solvers implemented
  in PETSc, a widely used open-source numerical software library.
