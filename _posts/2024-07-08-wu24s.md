title: Confidence-aware Contrastive Learning for Selective Classification
openreview: SDCx6rQV2l
abstract: Selective classification enables models to make predictions only when they
  are sufficiently confident, aiming to enhance safety and reliability, which is important
  in high-stakes scenarios. Previous methods mainly use deep neural networks and focus
  on modifying the architecture of classification layers to enable the model to estimate
  the confidence of its prediction. This work provides a generalization bound for
  selective classification, disclosing that optimizing feature layers helps improve
  the performance of selective classification. Inspired by this theory, we propose
  to explicitly improve the selective classification model at the feature level for
  the first time, leading to a novel Confidence-aware Contrastive Learning method
  for Selective Classification, CCL-SC, which similarizes the features of homogeneous
  instances and differentiates the features of heterogeneous instances, with the strength
  controlled by the modelâ€™s confidence. The experimental results on typical datasets,
  i.e., CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CelebA, and ImageNet, show that CCL-SC achieves significantly
  lower selective risk than state-of-the-art methods, across almost all coverage degrees.
  Moreover, it can be combined with existing methods to bring further improvement.
