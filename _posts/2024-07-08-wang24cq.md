title: Knowledge-aware Reinforced Language Models for Protein Directed Evolution
openreview: MikandLqtW
abstract: Directed evolution, a cornerstone of protein optimization, is to harness
  natural mutational processes to enhance protein functionality. Existing Machine
  Learning-assisted Directed Evolution (MLDE) methodologies typically rely on data-driven
  strategies and often overlook the profound domain knowledge in biochemical fields.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel Knowledge-aware Reinforced Language Model (KnowRLM)
  for MLDE. An Amino Acid Knowledge Graph (AAKG) is constructed to represent the intricate
  biochemical relationships among amino acids. We further propose a Protein Language
  Model (PLM)-based policy network that iteratively samples mutants through preferential
  random walks on the AAKG using a dynamic sliding window mechanism. The novel mutants
  are actively sampled to fine-tune a fitness predictor as the reward model, providing
  feedback to the knowledge-aware policy. Finally, we optimize the whole system in
  an active learning approach that mimics biological settings in practice.KnowRLM
  stands out for its ability to utilize contextual amino acid information from knowledge
  graphs, thus attaining advantages from both statistical patterns of protein sequences
  and biochemical properties of amino acids.Extensive experiments demonstrate the
  superior performance of KnowRLM in more efficiently identifying high-fitness mutants
  compared to existing methods.
