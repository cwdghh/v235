title: 'Position: Video as the New Language for Real-World Decision Making'
openreview: EZH4CsKV6O
abstract: 'Both text and video data are abundant on the internet and support large-scale
  self-supervised learning through next token or frame prediction. However, they have
  not been equally leveraged: language models have had significant real-world impact,
  whereas video generation has remained largely limited to media entertainment. Yet
  video data captures important information about the physical world that is difficult
  to express in language. To address this gap, we discuss an under-appreciated opportunity
  to extend video generation to solve tasks in the real world. We observe how, akin
  to language, video can serve as a unified interface that can absorb internet knowledge
  and represent diverse tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate how, like language models,
  video generation can serve as planners, agents, compute engines, and environment
  simulators through techniques such as in-context learning, planning and reinforcement
  learning. We identify major impact opportunities in domains such as robotics, self-driving,
  and science, supported by recent work that demonstrates how such advanced capabilities
  in video generation are plausibly within reach. Lastly, we identify key challenges
  in video generation that mitigate progress. Addressing these challenges will enable
  video generation models to demonstrate unique value alongside language models in
  a wider array of AI applications.'
