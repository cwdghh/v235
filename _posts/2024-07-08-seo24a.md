title: Retrieval-Augmented Score Distillation for Text-to-3D Generation
openreview: 1xKgDANODx
abstract: Text-to-3D generation has achieved significant success by incorporating
  powerful 2D diffusion models, but insufficient 3D prior knowledge also leads to
  the inconsistency of 3D geometry. Recently, since large-scale multi-view datasets
  have been released, fine-tuning the diffusion model on the multi-view datasets becomes
  a mainstream to solve the 3D inconsistency problem. However, it has confronted with
  fundamental difficulties regarding the limited quality and diversity of 3D data,
  compared with 2D data. To sidestep these trade-offs, we explore a retrieval-augmented
  approach tailored for score distillation, dubbed ReDream. We postulate that both
  expressiveness of 2D diffusion models and geometric consistency of 3D assets can
  be fully leveraged by employing the semantically relevant assets directly within
  the optimization process. To this end, we introduce novel framework for retrieval-based
  quality enhancement in text-to-3D generation. We leverage the retrieved asset to
  incorporate its geometric prior in the variational objective and adapt the diffusion
  model’s 2D prior toward view consistency, achieving drastic improvements in both
  geometry and fidelity of generated scenes. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate
  that ReDream exhibits superior quality with increased geometric consistency. Project
