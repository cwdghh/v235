title: Differentially Private Post-Processing for Fair Regression
openreview: JNeeRjKbuH
abstract: 'This paper describes a differentially private post-processing algorithm
  for learning fair regressors satisfying statistical parity, addressing privacy concerns
  of machine learning models trained on sensitive data, as well as fairness concerns
  of their potential to propagate historical biases. Our algorithm can be applied
  to post-process any given regressor to improve fairness by remapping its outputs.
  It consists of three steps: first, the output distributions are estimated privately
  via histogram density estimation and the Laplace mechanism, then their Wasserstein
  barycenter is computed, and the optimal transports to the barycenter are used for
  post-processing to satisfy fairness. We analyze the sample complexity of our algorithm
  and provide fairness guarantee, revealing a trade-off between the statistical bias
  and variance induced from the choice of the number of bins in the histogram, in
  which using less bins always favors fairness at the expense of error.'
