title: Test-Time Regret Minimization in Meta Reinforcement Learning
openreview: LM7j0zrUZB
abstract: Meta reinforcement learning sets a distribution over a set of tasks on which
  the agent can train at will, then is asked to learn an optimal policy for any test
  task efficiently. In this paper, we consider a finite set of tasks modeled through
  Markov decision processes with various dynamics. We assume to have endured a long
  training phase, from which the set of tasks is perfectly recovered, and we focus
  on regret minimization against the optimal policy in the unknown test task. Under
  a separation condition that states the existence of a state-action pair revealing
  a task against another, Chen et al. (2022) show that $O(M^2 \log(H))$ regret can
  be achieved, where $M, H$ are the number of tasks in the set and test episodes,
  respectively. In our first contribution, we demonstrate that the latter rate is
  nearly optimal by developing a novel lower bound for test-time regret minimization
  under separation, showing that a linear dependence with $M$ is unavoidable. Then,
  we present a family of stronger yet reasonable assumptions beyond separation, which
  we call strong identifiability, enabling algorithms achieving fast rates $\log (H)$
  and sublinear dependence with $M$ simultaneously. Our paper provides a new understanding
  of the statistical barriers of test-time regret minimization and when fast rates
  can be achieved.
