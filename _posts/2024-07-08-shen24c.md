title: 'Thermometer: Towards Universal Calibration for Large Language Models'
openreview: nP7Q1PnuLK
abstract: We consider the issue of calibration in large language models (LLM). Recent
  studies have found that common interventions such as instruction tuning often result
  in poorly calibrated LLMs. Although calibration is well-explored in traditional
  applications, calibrating LLMs is uniquely challenging. These challenges stem as
  much from the severe computational requirements of LLMs as from their versatility,
  which allows them to be applied to diverse tasks. Addressing these challenges, we
  propose THERMOMETER, a calibration approach tailored to LLMs. THERMOMETER learns
  an auxiliary model, given data from multiple tasks, for calibrating a LLM. It is
  computationally efficient, preserves the accuracy of the LLM, and produces better-calibrated
  responses for new tasks. Extensive empirical evaluations across various benchmarks
  demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
