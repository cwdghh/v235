title: 'MS$^3$D: A RG Flow-Based Regularization for GAN Training with Limited Data'
openreview: TuALw8xVum
abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have made impressive advances in
  image generation, but they often require large-scale training data to avoid degradation
  caused by discriminator overfitting. To tackle this issue, we investigate the challenge
  of training GANs with limited data, and propose a novel regularization method based
  on the idea of renormalization group (RG) in physics.We observe that in the limited
  data setting, the gradient pattern that the generator obtains from the discriminator
  becomes more aggregated over time. In RG context, this aggregated pattern exhibits
  a high discrepancy from its coarse-grained versions, which implies a high-capacity
  and sensitive system, prone to overfitting and collapse. To address this problem,
  we introduce a <b>m</b>ulti-<b>s</b>cale <b>s</b>tructural <b>s</b>elf-<b>d</b>issimilarity
  (MS$^3$D) regularization, which constrains the gradient field to have a consistent
  pattern across different scales, thereby fostering a more redundant and robust system.
  We show that our method can effectively enhance the performance and stability of
  GANs under limited data scenarios, and even allow them to generate high-quality
  images with very few data.
