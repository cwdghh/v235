title: Is In-Context Learning in Large Language Models Bayesian? A Martingale Perspective
openreview: b1YQ5WKY3w
abstract: 'In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a particularly remarkable characteristic
  of Large Language Models (LLM): given a pretrained LLM and an observed dataset,
  LLMs can make predictions for new data points from the same distribution without
  fine-tuning. Numerous works have postulated ICL as approximately Bayesian inference,
  rendering this a natural hypothesis. In this work, we analyse this hypothesis from
  a new angle through the <em>martingale property</em>, a fundamental requirement
  of a Bayesian learning system for exchangeable data. We show that the martingale
  property is a necessary condition for unambiguous predictions in such scenarios,
  and enables a principled, decomposed notion of uncertainty vital in trustworthy,
  safety-critical systems. We derive actionable checks with corresponding theory and
  test statistics which must hold if the martingale property is satisfied. We also
  examine if uncertainty in LLMs decreases as expected in Bayesian learning when more
  data is observed. In three experiments, we provide evidence for violations of the
  martingale property, and deviations from a Bayesian scaling behaviour of uncertainty,
  falsifying the hypothesis that ICL is Bayesian.'
