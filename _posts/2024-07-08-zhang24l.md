title: Towards Certified Unlearning for Deep Neural Networks
openreview: 1mf1ISuyS3
abstract: In the field of machine unlearning, certified unlearning has been extensively
  studied in convex machine learning models due to its high efficiency and strong
  theoretical guarantees. However, its application to deep neural networks (DNNs),
  known for their highly nonconvex nature, still poses challenges. To bridge the gap
  between certified unlearning and DNNs, we propose several simple techniques to extend
  certified unlearning methods to nonconvex objectives. To reduce the time complexity,
  we develop an efficient computation method by inverse Hessian approximation without
  compromising certification guarantees. In addition, we extend our discussion of
  certification to nonconvergence training and sequential unlearning, considering
  that real-world users can send unlearning requests at different time points. Extensive
  experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method
  and the advantages of certified unlearning in DNNs.
