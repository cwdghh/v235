title: Hybrid Neural Representations for Spherical Data
openreview: j6QZy90B93
abstract: In this paper, we study hybrid neural representations for spherical data,
  a domain of increasing relevance in scientific research. In particular, our work
  focuses on weather and climate data as well as cosmic microwave background (CMB)
  data. Although previous studies have delved into coordinate-based neural representations
  for spherical signals, they often fail to capture the intricate details of highly
  nonlinear signals. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel approach named
  Hybrid Neural Representations for Spherical data (HNeR-S). Our main idea is to use
  spherical feature-grids to obtain positional features which are combined with a
  multi-layer perceptron to predict the target signal. We consider feature-grids with
  equirectangular and hierarchical equal area isolatitude pixelization structures
  that align with weather data and CMB data, respectively. We extensively verify the
  effectiveness of our HNeR-S for regression, super-resolution, temporal interpolation,
  and compression tasks.
