title: Doubly Robust Causal Effect Estimation under Networked Interference via Targeted
  Learning
openreview: 5lI9wm4dws
abstract: Causal effect estimation under networked interference is an important but
  challenging problem. Available parametric methods are limited in their model space,
  while previous semiparametric methods, e.g., leveraging neural networks to fit only
  one single nuisance function, may still encounter misspecification problems under
  networked interference without appropriate assumptions on the data generation process.
  To mitigate bias stemming from misspecification, we propose a novel doubly robust
  causal effect estimator under networked interference, by adapting the targeted learning
  technique to the training of neural networks. Specifically, we generalize the targeted
  learning technique into the networked interference setting and establish the condition
  under which an estimator achieves double robustness. Based on the condition, we
  devise an end-to-end causal effect estimator by transforming the identified theoretical
  condition into a targeted loss. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis of our
  designed estimator, revealing a faster convergence rate compared to a single nuisance
  model. Extensive experimental results on two real-world networks with semisynthetic
  data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed estimators.
