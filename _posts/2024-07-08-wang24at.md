title: 'EfficientZero V2: Mastering Discrete and Continuous Control with Limited Data'
openreview: LHGMXcr6zx
abstract: Sample efficiency remains a crucial challenge in applying Reinforcement
  Learning (RL) to real-world tasks. While recent algorithms have made significant
  strides in improving sample efficiency, none have achieved consistently superior
  performance across diverse domains. In this paper, we introduce EfficientZero V2,
  a general framework designed for sample-efficient RL algorithms. We have expanded
  the performance of EfficientZero to multiple domains, encompassing both continuous
  and discrete actions, as well as visual and low-dimensional inputs. With a series
  of improvements we propose, EfficientZero V2 outperforms the current state-of-the-art
  (SoTA) by a significant margin in diverse tasks under the limited data setting.
  EfficientZero V2 exhibits a notable advancement over the prevailing general algorithm,
  DreamerV3, achieving superior outcomes in 50 of 66 evaluated tasks across multiple
  benchmarks, including Atari 100k, Proprio Control, and Vision Control.
