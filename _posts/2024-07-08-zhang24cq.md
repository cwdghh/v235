title: Accelerating Iterative Retrieval-augmented Language Model Serving with Speculation
openreview: CDnv4vg02f
abstract: This paper introduces RaLMSpec, a framework that accelerates iterative retrieval-augmented
  language model (RaLM) with <em>speculative retrieval</em> and <em>batched verification</em>.
  RaLMSpec further introduces several important systems optimizations, including prefetching,
  optimal speculation stride scheduler, and asynchronous verification. The combination
  of these techniques allows RaLMSPec to significantly outperform existing systems.
  For document-level iterative RaLM serving, evaluation over three LLMs on four QA
  datasets shows that RaLMSpec improves over existing approaches by $1.75$-$2.39\times$,
  $1.04$-$1.39\times$, and $1.31$-$1.77\times$ when the retriever is an exact dense
  retriever, approximate dense retriever, and sparse retriever respectively. For token-level
  iterative RaLM (KNN-LM) serving, RaLMSpec is up to $7.59\times$ and $2.45\times$
  faster than existing methods for exact dense and approximate dense retrievers, respectively.
