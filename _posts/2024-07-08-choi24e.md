title: 'PICLe: Eliciting Diverse Behaviors from Large Language Models with Persona
  In-Context Learning'
openreview: w1HdBXSJXn
abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on massive text corpora, which
  are encoded with diverse personality traits. This triggers an interesting goal of
  eliciting a desired personality trait from the LLM, and probing its behavioral preferences.
  Accordingly, we formalize the persona elicitation task, aiming to customize LLM
  behaviors to align with a target persona. We present Persona In-Context Learning
  (PICLe), a novel persona elicitation framework grounded in Bayesian inference. At
  the core, PICLe introduces a new ICL example selection criterion based on likelihood
  ratio, which is designed to optimally guide the model in eliciting a specific target
  persona. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PICLe through extensive comparisons
  against baseline methods across three contemporary LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/picle.
