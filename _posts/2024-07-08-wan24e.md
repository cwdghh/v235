title: 'Decouple then Classify: A Dynamic Multi-view Labeling Strategy with Shared
  and Specific Information'
openreview: WfJuiIiFzB
abstract: Sample labeling is the most primary and fundamental step of semi-supervised
  learning. In literature, most existing methods randomly label samples with a given
  ratio, but achieve unpromising and unstable results due to the randomness, especially
  in multi-view settings. To address this issue, we propose a Dynamic Multi-view Labeling
  Strategy with Shared and Specific Information. To be brief, by building two classifiers
  with existing labels to utilize decoupled shared and specific information, we select
  the samples of low classification confidence and label them in high priorities.
  The newly generated labels are also integrated to update the classifiers adaptively.
  The two processes are executed alternatively until a satisfying classification performance.
  To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments
  on popular benchmarks, achieving promising performance. The code is publicly available
  at https://github.com/wanxinhang/ICML2024_decouple_then_classify.
