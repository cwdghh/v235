title: Federated Neuro-Symbolic Learning
openreview: EQXZqBXeW9
abstract: Neuro-symbolic learning (NSL) models complex symbolic rule patterns into
  latent variable distributions by neural networks, which reduces rule search space
  and generates unseen rules to improve downstream task performance. Centralized NSL
  learning involves directly acquiring data from downstream tasks, which is not feasible
  for federated learning (FL). To address this limitation, we shift the focus from
  such a one-to-one interactive neuro-symbolic paradigm to one-to-many Federated Neuro-Symbolic
  Learning framework (FedNSL) with latent variables as the FL communication medium.
  Built on the basis of our novel reformulation of the NSL theory, FedNSL is capable
  of identifying and addressing rule distribution heterogeneity through a simple and
  effective Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence constraint on rule distribution applicable
  under the FL setting. It further theoretically adjusts variational expectation maximization
  (V-EM) to reduce the rule search space across domains. This is the first incorporation
  of distribution-coupled bilevel optimization into FL. Extensive experiments based
  on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate significant advantages of FedNSL
  compared to five state-of-the-art methods. It outperforms the best baseline by 17%
  and 29% in terms of unbalanced average training accuracy and unseen average testing
  accuracy, respectively.
