title: 'From Yes-Men to Truth-Tellers: Addressing Sycophancy in Large Language Models
  with Pinpoint Tuning'
openreview: d2vONO90Rw
abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) tend to prioritize adherence to user prompts
  over providing veracious responses, leading to the sycophancy issue. When challenged
  by users, LLMs tend to admit mistakes and provide inaccurate responses even if they
  initially provided the correct answer. Recent works propose to employ supervised
  fine-tuning (SFT) to mitigate the sycophancy issue, while it typically leads to
  the degeneration of LLMsâ€™ general capability. To address the challenge, we propose
  a novel supervised pinpoint tuning (SPT), where the region-of-interest modules are
  tuned for a given objective. Specifically, SPT first reveals and verifies a small
  percentage ($<$5%) of the basic modules, which significantly affect a particular
  behavior of LLMs. i.e., sycophancy. Subsequently, SPT merely fine-tunes these identified
  modules while freezing the rest. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed SPT,
  we conduct comprehensive experiments, demonstrating that SPT significantly mitigates
  the sycophancy issue of LLMs (even better than SFT). Moreover, SPT introduces limited
  or even no side effects on the general capability of LLMs. Our results shed light
  on how to precisely, effectively, and efficiently explain and improve the targeted
  ability of LLMs.
