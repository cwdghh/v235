title: Partial Multi-View Multi-Label Classification via Semantic Invariance Learning
  and Prototype Modeling
openreview: 5ap1MmUqO6
abstract: The difficulty of partial multi-view multi-label learning lies in coupling
  the consensus of multi-view data with the task relevance of multi-label classification,
  under the condition where partial views and labels are unavailable. In this paper,
  we seek to compress cross-view representation to maximize the proportion of shared
  information to better predict semantic tags. To achieve this, we establish a model
  consistent with the information bottleneck theory for learning cross-view shared
  representation, minimizing non-shared information while maintaining feature validity
  to help increase the purity of task-relevant information. Furthermore, we model
  multi-label prototype instances in the latent space and learn label correlations
  in a data-driven manner. Our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
  on multiple public datasets while exhibiting good compatibility with both partial
  and complete data. Finally, we experimentally reveal the importance of condensing
  shared information under the premise of information balancing, in the process of
  multi-view information encoding and compression.
