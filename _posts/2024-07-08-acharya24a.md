title: Balancing Feature Similarity and Label Variability for Optimal Size-Aware One-shot
  Subset Selection
openreview: MurkwIl0h3
abstract: Subset or core-set selection offers a data-efficient way for training deep
  learning models. One-shot subset selection poses additional challenges as subset
  selection is only performed once and full set data become unavailable after the
  selection. However, most existing methods tend to choose either diverse or difficult
  data samples, which fail to faithfully represent the joint data distribution that
  is comprised of both feature and label information. The selection is also performed
  independently from the subset size, which plays an essential role in choosing what
  types of samples. To address this critical gap, we propose to conduct Feature similarity
  and Label variability Balanced One-shot Subset Selection (BOSS), aiming to construct
  an optimal size-aware subset for data-efficient deep learning. We show that a novel
  balanced core-set loss bound theoretically justifies the need to simultaneously
  consider both diversity and difficulty to form an optimal subset. It also reveals
  how the subset size influences the bound. We further connect the inaccessible bound
  to a practical surrogate target which is tailored to subset sizes and varying levels
  of overall difficulty. We design a novel Beta-scoring importance function to delicately
  control the optimal balance of diversity and difficulty. Comprehensive experiments
  conducted on both synthetic and real data justify the important theoretical properties
  and demonstrate the superior performance of BOSS as compared with the competitive
  baselines.
