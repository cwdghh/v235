title: Language Generation with Strictly Proper Scoring Rules
openreview: LALSZ88Xpx
abstract: 'Language generation based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) has become
  the fundamental approach for text generation. Maximum likelihood estimation is typically
  performed by minimizing the log-likelihood loss, also known as the logarithmic score
  in statistical decision theory. The logarithmic score is strictly proper in the
  sense that it encourages honest forecasts, where the expected score is maximized
  only when the model reports true probabilities. Although many strictly proper scoring
  rules exist, the logarithmic score is the only local scoring rule among them that
  depends exclusively on the probability of the observed sample, making it capable
  of handling the exponentially large sample space of natural text. In this work,
  we propose a straightforward strategy for adapting scoring rules to language generation,
  allowing for language modeling with any non-local scoring rules. Leveraging this
  strategy, we train language generation models using two classic strictly proper
  scoring rules, the Brier score and the Spherical score, as alternatives to the logarithmic
  score. Experimental results indicate that simply substituting the loss function,
  without adjusting other hyperparameters, can yield substantial improvements in modelâ€™s
  generation capabilities. Moreover, these improvements can scale up to large language
  models (LLMs) such as LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B. Source code: https://github.com/shaochenze/ScoringRulesLM.'
