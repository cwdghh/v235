title: Parsimonious Learning-Augmented Approximations for Dense Instances of $\mathcalNP$-hard
  Problems
openreview: AD5QC1BTJL
abstract: The classical work of (Arora et al., 1999) provides a scheme that gives,
  for any $\epsilon>0$, a polynomial time $1-\epsilon$ approximation algorithm for
  dense instances of a family of $\mathcal{NP}$-hard problems, such as Max-CUT and
  Max-$k$-SAT. In this paper we extend and speed up this scheme using a logarithmic
  number of one-bit predictions. We propose a learning augmented framework which aims
  at finding fast algorithms which guarantees approximation consistency, smoothness
  and robustness with respect to the prediction error. We provide such algorithms,
  which moreover use predictions parsimoniously, for dense instances of various optimization
  problems.
