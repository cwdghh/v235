title: Adaptive Feature Selection for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment by Mitigating
  Semantic Noise Sensitivity
openreview: LZkhKZvhHs
abstract: The current state-of-the-art No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA)
  methods typically rely on feature extraction from upstream semantic backbone networks,
  assuming that all extracted features are relevant. However, we make a key observation
  that not all features are beneficial, and some may even be harmful, necessitating
  careful selection. Empirically, we find that many image pairs with small feature
  spatial distances can have vastly different quality scores, indicating that the
  extracted features may contain quality-irrelevant noise. To address this issue,
  we propose a Quality-Aware Feature Matching IQA Metric (QFM-IQM) that employs an
  adversarial perspective to remove harmful semantic noise features from the upstream
  task. Specifically, QFM-IQM enhances the semantic noise distinguish capabilities
  by matching image pairs with similar quality scores but varying semantic features
  as adversarial semantic noise and adaptively adjusting the upstream task’s features
  by reducing sensitivity to adversarial noise perturbation. Furthermore, we utilize
  a distillation framework to expand the dataset and improve the model’s generalization
  ability. Extensive experiments conducted on eight standard IQA datasets have demonstrated
  the effectiveness of our proposed QFM-IQM.
