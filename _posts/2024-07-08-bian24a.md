title: 'Multi-Patch Prediction: Adapting Language Models for Time Series Representation
  Learning'
openreview: Rx9GMufByc
abstract: 'In this study, we present $\text{aL\small{LM}4T\small{S}}$, an innovative
  framework that adapts Large Language Models (LLMs) for time-series representation
  learning. Central to our approach is that we reconceive time-series forecasting
  as a self-supervised, multi-patch prediction task, which, compared to traditional
  mask-and-reconstruction methods, captures temporal dynamics in patch representations
  more effectively. Our strategy encompasses two-stage training: (i). a causal continual
  pre-training phase on various time-series datasets, anchored on next patch prediction,
  effectively syncing LLM capabilities with the intricacies of time-series data; (ii).
  fine-tuning for multi-patch prediction in the targeted time-series context. A distinctive
  element of our framework is the patch-wise decoding layer, which departs from previous
  methods reliant on sequence-level decoding. Such a design directly transposes individual
  patches into temporal sequences, thereby significantly bolstering the modelâ€™s proficiency
  in mastering temporal patch-based representations. $\text{aL\small{LM}4T\small{S}}$
  demonstrates superior performance in several downstream tasks, proving its effectiveness
  in deriving temporal representations with enhanced transferability and marking a
  pivotal advancement in the adaptation of LLMs for time-series analysis.'
