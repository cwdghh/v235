title: 'Tabular Insights, Visual Impacts: Transferring Expertise from Tables to Images'
openreview: v7I5FtL2pV
abstract: Transferring knowledge across diverse data modalities is receiving increasing
  attention in machine learning. This paper tackles the task of leveraging expert-derived,
  yet expensive, tabular data to enhance image-based predictions when tabular data
  is unavailable during inference. The primary challenges stem from the inherent complexity
  of accurately mapping diverse tabular data to visual contexts, coupled with the
  necessity to devise distinct strategies for numerical and categorical tabular attributes.
  We propose CHannel tAbulaR alignment with optiMal tranSport (Charms), which establishes
  an alignment between image channels and tabular attributes, enabling selective knowledge
  transfer that is pertinent to visual features. Specifically, Charms measures similarity
  distributions across modalities to effectively differentiate and transfer relevant
  tabular features, with a focus on morphological characteristics, enhancing the capabilities
  of visual classifiers. By maximizing the mutual information between image channels
  and tabular features, knowledge from both numerical and categorical tabular attributes
  are extracted. Experimental results demonstrate that Charms not only enhances the
  performance of image classifiers but also improves their interpretability by effectively
  utilizing tabular knowledge.
