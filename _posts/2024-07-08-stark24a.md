title: Harmonic Self-Conditioned Flow Matching for joint Multi-Ligand Docking and
  Binding Site Design
openreview: XTrMY9sHKF
abstract: A significant amount of protein function requires binding small molecules,
  including enzymatic catalysis. As such, designing binding pockets for small molecules
  has several impactful applications ranging from drug synthesis to energy storage.
  Towards this goal, we first develop HarmonicFlow, an improved generative process
  over 3D protein-ligand binding structures based on our self-conditioned flow matching
  objective. FlowSite extends this flow model to jointly generate a protein pocket’s
  discrete residue types and the molecule’s binding 3D structure. We show that HarmonicFlow
  improves upon state-of-the-art generative processes for docking in simplicity, generality,
  and average sample quality in pocket-level docking. Enabled by this structure modeling,
  FlowSite designs binding sites substantially better than baseline approaches.
