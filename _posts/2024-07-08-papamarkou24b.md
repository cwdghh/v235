title: 'Position: Bayesian Deep Learning is Needed in the Age of Large-Scale AI'
openreview: PrmxFWI1Fr
abstract: In the current landscape of deep learning research, there is a predominant
  emphasis on achieving high predictive accuracy in supervised tasks involving large
  image and language datasets. However, a broader perspective reveals a multitude
  of overlooked metrics, tasks, and data types, such as uncertainty, active and continual
  learning, and scientific data, that demand attention. Bayesian deep learning (BDL)
  constitutes a promising avenue, offering advantages across these diverse settings.
  This paper posits that BDL can elevate the capabilities of deep learning. It revisits
  the strengths of BDL, acknowledges existing challenges, and highlights some exciting
  research avenues aimed at addressing these obstacles. Looking ahead, the discussion
  focuses on possible ways to combine large-scale foundation models with BDL to unlock
  their full potential.
