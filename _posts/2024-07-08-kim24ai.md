title: 'One Size Fits All for Semantic Shifts: Adaptive Prompt Tuning for Continual
  Learning'
openreview: WUi1AqhKn5
abstract: In real-world continual learning (CL) scenarios, tasks often exhibit intricate
  and unpredictable semantic shifts, posing challenges for <em>fixed</em> prompt management
  strategies which are tailored to only handle semantic shifts of <em>uniform</em>
  degree (i.e., uniformly mild or uniformly abrupt). To address this limitation, we
  propose an <em>adaptive</em> prompting approach that effectively accommodates semantic
  shifts of <em>varying</em> degree where mild and abrupt shifts are mixed. AdaPromptCL
  employs the assign-and-refine semantic grouping mechanism that dynamically manages
  prompt groups in accordance with the semantic similarity between tasks, enhancing
  the quality of grouping through continuous refinement. Our experiment results demonstrate
  that AdaPromptCL outperforms existing prompting methods by up to 21.3%, especially
  in the benchmark datasets with diverse semantic shifts between tasks.
