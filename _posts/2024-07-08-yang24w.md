title: Exploration and Anti-Exploration with Distributional Random Network Distillation
openreview: rIrpzmqRBk
abstract: Exploration remains a critical issue in deep reinforcement learning for
  an agent to attain high returns in unknown environments. Although the prevailing
  exploration Random Network Distillation (RND) algorithm has been demonstrated to
  be effective in numerous environments, it often needs more discriminative power
  in bonus allocation. This paper highlights the “bonus inconsistency” issue within
  RND, pinpointing its primary limitation. To address this issue, we introduce the
  Distributional RND (DRND), a derivative of the RND. DRND enhances the exploration
  process by distilling a distribution of random networks and implicitly incorporating
  pseudo counts to improve the precision of bonus allocation. This refinement encourages
  agents to engage in more extensive exploration. Our method effectively mitigates
  the inconsistency issue without introducing significant computational overhead.
  Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of
  our approach over the original RND algorithm. Our method excels in challenging online
  exploration scenarios and effectively serves as an anti-exploration mechanism in
  D4RL offline tasks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/yk7333/DRND.
