title: 'EquiAV: Leveraging Equivariance for Audio-Visual Contrastive Learning'
openreview: 8nd1yBRCDl
abstract: Recent advancements in self-supervised audio-visual representation learning
  have demonstrated its potential to capture rich and comprehensive representations.
  However, despite the advantages of data augmentation verified in many learning methods,
  audio-visual learning has struggled to fully harness these benefits, as augmentations
  can easily disrupt the correspondence between input pairs. To address this limitation,
  we introduce EquiAV, a novel framework that leverages equivariance for audio-visual
  contrastive learning. Our approach begins with extending equivariance to audio-visual
  learning, facilitated by a shared attention-based transformation predictor. It enables
  the aggregation of features from diverse augmentations into a representative embedding,
  providing robust supervision. Notably, this is achieved with minimal computational
  overhead. Extensive ablation studies and qualitative results verify the effectiveness
  of our method. EquiAV outperforms previous works across various audio-visual benchmarks.
