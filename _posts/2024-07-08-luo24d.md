title: 'OMPO: A Unified Framework for RL under Policy and Dynamics Shifts'
openreview: R83VIZtHXA
abstract: 'Training reinforcement learning policies using environment interaction
  data collected from varying policies or dynamics presents a fundamental challenge.
  Existing works often overlook the distribution discrepancies induced by policy or
  dynamics shifts, or rely on specialized algorithms with task priors, thus often
  resulting in suboptimal policy performances and high learning variances. In this
  paper, we identify a unified strategy for online RL policy learning under diverse
  settings of policy and dynamics shifts: transition occupancy matching. In light
  of this, we introduce a surrogate policy learning objective by considering the transition
  occupancy discrepancies and then cast it into a tractable min-max optimization problem
  through dual reformulation. Our method, dubbed Occupancy-Matching Policy Optimization
  (OMPO), features a specialized actor-critic structure equipped with a distribution
  discriminator and a small-size local buffer. We conduct extensive experiments based
  on the OpenAI Gym, Meta-World, and Panda Robots environments, encompassing policy
  shifts under stationary and non-stationary dynamics, as well as domain adaption.
  The results demonstrate that OMPO outperforms the specialized baselines from different
  categories in all settings. We also find that OMPO exhibits particularly strong
  performance when combined with domain randomization, highlighting its potential
  in RL-based robotics applications.'
