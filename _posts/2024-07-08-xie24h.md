title: 'MH-pFLID: Model Heterogeneous personalized Federated Learning via Injection
  and Distillation for Medical Data Analysis'
openreview: Jvh8HM9YEJ
abstract: Federated learning is widely used in medical applications for training global
  models without needing local data access, but varying computational capabilities
  and network architectures (system heterogeneity) across clients pose significant
  challenges in effectively aggregating information from non-independently and identically
  distributed (non-IID) data (statistic heterogeneity). Current federated learning
  methods using knowledge distillation require public datasets, raising privacy and
  data collection issues. Additionally, these datasets require additional local computing
  and storage resources, which is a burden for medical institutions with limited hardware
  conditions. In this paper, we introduce a novel federated learning paradigm, named
  Model Heterogeneous personalized Federated Learning via Injection and Distillation
  (MH-pFLID). Our framework leverages a lightweight messenger model, eliminating the
  need for public datasets and reducing the training cost for each client. We also
  develops receiver and transmitter modules for each client to separate local biases
  from generalizable information, reducing biased data collection and mitigating client
  drift. Our experiments on various medical tasks including image classification,
  image segmentation, and time-series classification, show MH-pFLID outperforms state-of-the-art
  methods in all these areas and has good generalizability.
