title: On the Consistency of Kernel Methods with Dependent Observations
openreview: AEHXvoOxV9
abstract: The consistency of a learning method is usually established under the assumption
  that the observations are a realization of an independent and identically distributed
  (i.i.d.) or mixing process. Yet, kernel methods such as support vector machines
  (SVMs), Gaussian processes, or conditional kernel mean embeddings (CKMEs) all give
  excellent performance under sampling schemes that are obviously non-i.i.d., such
  as when data comes from a dynamical system. We propose the new notion of <em>empirical
  weak convergence (EWC)</em> as a general assumption explaining such phenomena for
  kernel methods. It assumes the existence of a random asymptotic data distribution
  and is a strict weakening of previous assumptions in the field. Our main results
  then establish consistency of SVMs, kernel mean embeddings, and general Hilbert-space
  valued empirical expectations with EWC data. Our analysis holds for both finite-
  and infinite-dimensional outputs, as we extend classical results of statistical
  learning to the latter case. In particular, it is also applicable to CKMEs. Overall,
  our results open new classes of processes to statistical learning and can serve
  as a foundation for a theory of learning beyond i.i.d. and mixing.
