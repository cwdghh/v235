title: Flexible Residual Binarization for Image Super-Resolution
openreview: zji9DLksTz
abstract: 'Binarized image super-resolution (SR) has attracted much research attention
  due to its potential to drastically reduce parameters and operations. However, most
  binary SR works binarize network weights directly, which hinders high-frequency
  information extraction. Furthermore, as a pixel-wise reconstruction task, binarization
  often results in heavy representation content distortion. To address these issues,
  we propose a flexible residual binarization (FRB) method for image SR. We first
  propose a second-order residual binarization (SRB), to counter the information loss
  caused by binarization. In addition to the primary weight binarization, we also
  binarize the reconstruction error, which is added as a residual term in the prediction.
  Furthermore, to narrow the representation content gap between the binarized and
  full-precision networks, we propose Distillation-guided Binarization Training (DBT).
  We uniformly align the contents of different bit widths by constructing a normalized
  attention form. Finally, we generalize our method by applying our FRB to binarize
  convolution and Transformer-based SR networks, resulting in two binary baselines:
  FRBC and FRBT. We conduct extensive experiments and comparisons with recent leading
  binarization methods. Our proposed baselines, FRBC and FRBT, achieve superior performance
  both quantitatively and visually. The code and model will be released.'
