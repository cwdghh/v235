title: When is Transfer Learning Possible?
openreview: 9yADTDHgGu
abstract: We present a general framework for transfer learning that is flexible enough
  to capture transfer in supervised, reinforcement, and imitation learning. Our framework
  enables new insights into the fundamental question of <em>when</em> we can successfully
  transfer learned information across problems. We model the learner as interacting
  with a sequence of problem instances, or <em>environments</em>, each of which is
  generated from a common structural causal model (SCM) by choosing the SCM’s parameters
  from restricted sets. We derive a procedure that can propagate restrictions on SCM
  parameters through the SCM’s graph structure to other parameters that we are trying
  to learn. The propagated restrictions then enable more efficient learning (i.e.,
  transfer). By analyzing the procedure, we are able to challenge widely-held beliefs
  about transfer learning. First, we show that having <em>sparse</em> changes across
  environments is neither necessary nor sufficient for transfer. Second, we show an
  example where the common heuristic of <em>freezing</em> a layer in a network causes
  poor transfer performance. We then use our procedure to select a more refined set
  of parameters to freeze, leading to successful transfer learning.
