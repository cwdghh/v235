title: Feasibility Consistent Representation Learning for Safe Reinforcement Learning
openreview: JNHK11bAGl
abstract: In the field of safe reinforcement learning (RL), finding a balance between
  satisfying safety constraints and optimizing reward performance presents a significant
  challenge. A key obstacle in this endeavor is the estimation of safety constraints,
  which is typically more difficult than estimating a reward metric due to the sparse
  nature of the constraint signals. To address this issue, we introduce a novel framework
  named Feasibility Consistent Safe Reinforcement Learning (FCSRL). This framework
  combines representation learning with feasibility-oriented objectives to identify
  and extract safety-related information from the raw state for safe RL. Leveraging
  self-supervised learning techniques and a more learnable safety metric, our approach
  enhances the policy learning and constraint estimation. Empirical evaluations across
  a range of vector-state and image-based tasks demonstrate that our method is capable
  of learning a better safety-aware embedding and achieving superior performance than
  previous representation learning baselines.
