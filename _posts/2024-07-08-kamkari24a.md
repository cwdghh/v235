title: A Geometric Explanation of the Likelihood OOD Detection Paradox
openreview: EVMzCKLpdD
abstract: 'Likelihood-based deep generative models (DGMs) commonly exhibit a puzzling
  behaviour: when trained on a relatively complex dataset, they assign higher likelihood
  values to out-of-distribution (OOD) data from simpler sources. Adding to the mystery,
  OOD samples are never generated by these DGMs despite having higher likelihoods.
  This two-pronged paradox has yet to be conclusively explained, making likelihood-based
  OOD detection unreliable. Our primary observation is that high-likelihood regions
  will not be generated if they contain minimal probability mass. We demonstrate how
  this seeming contradiction of large densities yet low probability mass can occur
  around data confined to low-dimensional manifolds. We also show that this scenario
  can be identified through local intrinsic dimension (LID) estimation, and propose
  a method for OOD detection which pairs the likelihoods and LID estimates obtained
  from a <em>pre-trained</em> DGM. Our method can be applied to normalizing flows
  and score-based diffusion models, and obtains results which match or surpass state-of-the-art
  OOD detection benchmarks using the same DGM backbones. Our code is available at
  our GitHub repository.'
