title: Optimal Transport for Structure Learning Under Missing Data
openreview: '09Robz3Ppy'
abstract: Causal discovery in the presence of missing data introduces a chicken-and-egg
  dilemma. While the goal is to recover the true causal structure, robust imputation
  requires considering the dependencies or, preferably, causal relations among variables.
  Merely filling in missing values with existing imputation methods and subsequently
  applying structure learning on the complete data is empirically shown to be sub-optimal.
  To address this problem, we propose a score-based algorithm for learning causal
  structures from missing data based on optimal transport. This optimal transport
  viewpoint diverges from existing score-based approaches that are dominantly based
  on expectation maximization. We formulate structure learning as a density fitting
  problem, where the goal is to find the causal model that induces a distribution
  of minimum Wasserstein distance with the observed data distribution. Our framework
  is shown to recover the true causal graphs more effectively than competing methods
  in most simulations and real-data settings. Empirical evidence also shows the superior
  scalability of our approach, along with the flexibility to incorporate any off-the-shelf
  causal discovery methods for complete data.
