title: 'Residual-Conditioned Optimal Transport: Towards Structure-Preserving Unpaired
  and Paired Image Restoration'
openreview: irBHPlknxP
abstract: Deep learning-based image restoration methods generally struggle with faithfully
  preserving the structures of the original image. In this work, we propose a novel
  Residual-Conditioned Optimal Transport (RCOT) approach, which models image restoration
  as an optimal transport (OT) problem for both unpaired and paired settings, introducing
  the transport residual as a unique degradation-specific cue for both the transport
  cost and the transport map. Specifically, we first formalize a Fourier residual-guided
  OT objective by incorporating the degradation-specific information of the residual
  into the transport cost. We further design the transport map as a two-pass RCOT
  map that comprises a base model and a refinement process, in which the transport
  residual is computed by the base model in the first pass and then encoded as a degradation-specific
  embedding to condition the second-pass restoration. By duality, the RCOT problem
  is transformed into a minimax optimization problem, which can be solved by adversarially
  training neural networks. Extensive experiments on multiple restoration tasks show
  that RCOT achieves competitive performance in terms of both distortion measures
  and perceptual quality, restoring images with more faithful structures as compared
  with state-of-the-art methods.
