title: Stabilizing Policy Gradients for Stochastic Differential Equations via Consistency
  with Perturbation Process
openreview: ytz2naZoDB
abstract: Considering generating samples with high rewards, we focus on optimizing
  deep neural networks parameterized stochastic differential equations (SDEs), the
  advanced generative models with high expressiveness, with policy gradient, the leading
  algorithm in reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, when applying policy gradients
  to SDEs, since the policy gradient is estimated on a finite set of trajectories,
  it can be ill-defined, and the policy behavior in data-scarce regions may be uncontrolled.
  This challenge compromises the stability of policy gradients and negatively impacts
  sample complexity. To address these issues, we propose constraining the SDE to be
  consistent with its associated perturbation process. Since the perturbation process
  covers the entire space and is easy to sample, we can mitigate the aforementioned
  problems. Our framework offers a general approach allowing for a versatile selection
  of policy gradient methods to effectively and efficiently train SDEs. We evaluate
  our algorithm on the task of structure-based drug design and optimize the binding
  affinity of generated ligand molecules. Our method achieves the best Vina score
  (-9.07) on the CrossDocked2020 dataset.
