title: Structured Chemistry Reasoning with Large Language Models
openreview: 7R3pzxTSlg
abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in diverse areas, yet struggle with complex
  scientific reasoning, especially in the field of chemistry. Different from the simple
  chemistry tasks (e.g., molecule classification) addressed in previous studies, complex
  chemistry problems require not only vast knowledge and precise calculation, but
  also compositional reasoning about rich dynamic interactions of different concepts
  (e.g., temperature changes). Our study shows that even advanced LLMs, like GPT-4,
  can fail easily in different ways. Interestingly, the errors often stem not from
  a lack of domain knowledge within the LLMs, but rather from the absence of an effective
  reasoning <em>structure</em> that guides the LLMs to elicit the right knowledge,
  incorporate the knowledge in step-by-step reasoning, and iteratively refine results
  for further improved quality. On this basis, we introduce StructChem, a simple yet
  effective prompting strategy that offers the desired guidance and substantially
  boosts the LLMs’ chemical reasoning capability. Testing across four chemistry areas—quantum
  chemistry, mechanics, physical chemistry, and kinetics—StructChem substantially
  enhances GPT-4’s performance, with up to 30% peak improvement. Our analysis also
  underscores the unique difficulties of precise grounded reasoning in science with
  LLMs, highlighting a need for more research in this area.
