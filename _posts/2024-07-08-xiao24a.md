title: Towards a Self-contained Data-driven Global Weather Forecasting Framework
openreview: Y2WorV5ag6
abstract: 'Data-driven weather forecasting models are advancing rapidly, yet they
  rely on initial states (i.e., analysis states) typically produced by traditional
  data assimilation algorithms. Four-dimensional variational assimilation (4DVar)
  is one of the most widely adopted data assimilation algorithms in numerical weather
  prediction centers; it is accurate but computationally expensive. In this paper,
  we aim to couple the AI forecasting model, FengWu, with 4DVar to build a self-contained
  data-driven global weather forecasting framework, FengWu-4DVar. To achieve this,
  we propose an <em>AI-embedded</em> 4DVar algorithm that includes three components:
  (1) a 4DVar objective function embedded with the FengWu forecasting model and its
  error representation to enhance efficiency and accuracy; (2) a spherical-harmonic-transform-based
  (SHT-based) approximation strategy for capturing the horizontal correlation of background
  error; and (3) an auto-differentiation (AD) scheme for determining the optimal analysis
  fields. Experimental results show that under the ERA5 simulated observational data
  with varying proportions and noise levels, FengWu-4DVar can generate accurate analysis
  fields; remarkably, it has achieved stable self-contained global weather forecasts
  for an entire year for the first time, demonstrating its potential for real-world
  applications. Additionally, our framework is approximately 100 times faster than
  the traditional 4DVar algorithm under similar experimental conditions, highlighting
  its significant computational efficiency.'
