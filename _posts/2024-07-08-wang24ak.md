title: 'Visual Transformer with Differentiable Channel Selection: An Information Bottleneck
  Inspired Approach'
openreview: iup9NElHji
abstract: Self-attention and transformers have been widely used in deep learning.
  Recent efforts have been devoted to incorporating transformer blocks into different
  types of neural architectures, including those with convolutions, leading to various
  visual transformers for computer vision tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel
  and compact transformer block, Transformer with Differentiable Channel Selection,
  or DCS-Transformer. DCS-Transformer features channel selection in the computation
  of the attention weights and the input/output features of the MLP in the transformer
  block. Our DCS-Transformer is compatible with many popular and compact transformer
  networks, such as MobileViT and EfficientViT, and it reduces the FLOPs of the visual
  transformers while maintaining or even improving the prediction accuracy. In the
  experiments, we replace all the transformer blocks in MobileViT and EfficientViT
  with DCS-Transformer blocks, leading to DCS-Transformer networks with different
  backbones. The DCS-Transformer is motivated by reduction of Information Bottleneck,
  and a novel variational upper bound for the IB loss which can be optimized by SGD
  is derived and incorporated into the training loss of the network with DCS-Transformer.
  Extensive results on image classification and object detection evidence that DCS-Transformer
  renders compact and efficient visual transformers with comparable or much better
  prediction accuracy than the original visual transformers. The code of DCS-Transformer
  is available at https://github.com/Statistical-Deep-Learning/DCS-Transformer.
