title: 'Position: Is machine learning good or bad for the natural sciences?'
openreview: rU8o0QQCy0
abstract: Machine learning (ML) methods are having a huge impact across all of the
  sciences. However, ML has a strong ontology — in which only the data exist — and
  a strong epistemology — in which a model is considered good if it performs well
  on held-out training data. These philosophies are in strong conflict with both standard
  practices and key philosophies in the natural sciences. Here we identify some locations
  for ML in the natural sciences at which the ontology and epistemology are valuable.
  For example, when an expressive machine learning model is used in a causal inference
  to represent the effects of confounders, such as foregrounds, backgrounds, or instrument
  calibration parameters, the model capacity and loose philosophy of ML can make the
  results more trustworthy. We also show that there are contexts in which the introduction
  of ML introduces strong, unwanted statistical biases. For one, when ML models are
  used to emulate physical (or first-principles) simulations, they amplify confirmation
  biases. For another, when expressive regressions are used to label datasets, those
  labels cannot be used in downstream joint or ensemble analyses without taking on
  uncontrolled biases. The question in the title is being asked of all of the natural
  sciences; that is, we are calling on the scientific communities to take a step back
  and consider the role and value of ML in their fields; the (partial) answers we
  give here come from the particular perspective of physics.
