title: Bespoke Non-Stationary Solvers for Fast Sampling of Diffusion and Flow Models
openreview: FCtO757Onl
abstract: This paper introduces Bespoke Non-Stationary (BNS) Solvers, a solver distillation
  approach to improve sample efficiency of Diffusion and Flow models. BNS solvers
  are based on a family of non-stationary solvers that provably subsumes existing
  numerical ODE solvers and consequently demonstrate considerable improvement in sample
  approximation (PSNR) over these baselines. Compared to model distillation, BNS solvers
  benefit from a tiny parameter space ($<$200 parameters), fast optimization (two
  orders of magnitude faster), maintain diversity of samples, and in contrast to previous
  solver distillation approaches nearly close the gap from standard distillation methods
  such as Progressive Distillation in the low-medium NFE regime. For example, BNS
  solver achieves 45 PSNR / 1.76 FID using 16 NFE in class-conditional ImageNet-64.
  We experimented with BNS solvers for conditional image generation, text-to-image
  generation, and text-2-audio generation showing significant improvement in sample
  approximation (PSNR) in all.
