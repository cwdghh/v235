title: 'Accelerating Look-ahead in Bayesian Optimization: Multilevel Monte Carlo is
  All you Need'
openreview: 46vXhZn7lN
abstract: We leverage multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) to improve the performance of
  multi-step look- ahead Bayesian optimization (BO) methods that involve nested expectations
  and maximizations. Often these expectations must be computed by Monte Carlo (MC).
  The complexity rate of naive MC degrades for nested operations, whereas MLMC is
  capable of achieving the canonical MC convergence rate for this type of problem,
  independently of dimension and without any smoothness assumptions. Our theoretical
  study focuses on the approximation improvements for two- and three-step look-ahead
  acquisition functions, but, as we discuss, the approach is generalizable in various
  ways, including beyond the context of BO. Our findings are verified numerically
  and the benefits of MLMC for BO are illustrated on several benchmark examples. Code
