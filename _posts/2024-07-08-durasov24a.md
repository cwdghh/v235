title: Enabling Uncertainty Estimation in Iterative Neural Networks
openreview: N6A6t6xlKm
abstract: 'Turning pass-through network architectures into iterative ones, which use
  their own output as input, is a well-known approach for boosting performance. In
  this paper, we argue that such architectures offer an additional benefit: The convergence
  rate of their successive outputs is highly correlated with the accuracy of the value
  to which they converge. Thus, we can use the convergence rate as a useful proxy
  for uncertainty. This results in an approach to uncertainty estimation that provides
  state-of-the-art estimates at a much lower computational cost than techniques like
  Ensembles, and without requiring any modifications to the original iterative model.
  We demonstrate its practical value by embedding it in two application domains: road
  detection in aerial images and the estimation of aerodynamic properties of 2D and
  3D shapes.'
