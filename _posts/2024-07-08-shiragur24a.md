title: Causal Discovery with Fewer Conditional Independence Tests
openreview: HpT19AKddu
abstract: Many questions in science center around the fundamental problem of understanding
  causal relationships. However, most constraint-based causal discovery algorithms,
  including the well-celebrated PC algorithm, often incur an <em>exponential</em>
  number of conditional independence (CI) tests, posing limitations in various applications.
  Addressing this, our work focuses on characterizing what can be learned about the
  underlying causal graph with a reduced number of CI tests. We show that it is possible
  to a learn a coarser representation of the hidden causal graph with a <em>polynomial</em>
  number of tests. This coarser representation, named Causal Consistent Partition
  Graph (CCPG), comprises of a partition of the vertices and a directed graph defined
  over its components. CCPG satisfies consistency of orientations and additional constraints
  which favor finer partitions. Furthermore, it reduces to the underlying causal graph
  when the causal graph is identifiable. As a consequence, our results offer the first
  efficient algorithm for recovering the true causal graph with a polynomial number
  of tests, in special cases where the causal graph is fully identifiable through
  observational data and potentially additional interventions.
