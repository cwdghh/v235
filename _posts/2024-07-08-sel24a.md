title: 'Algorithm of Thoughts: Enhancing Exploration of Ideas in Large Language Models'
openreview: KJL2b6BthC
abstract: 'Current literature, aiming to surpass the "Chain-of-Thought" approach,
  often resorts to external modi operandi involving halting, modifying, and then resuming
  the generation process to boost Large Language Models’ (LLMs) reasoning capacities.
  Due to their <em>myopic perspective</em>, they escalate the number of query requests,
  leading to increased costs, memory, and computational overheads. Addressing this,
  we propose the <em>Algorithm of Thoughts</em>—a novel strategy that propels LLMs
  through algorithmic reasoning pathways. By employing algorithmic examples fully
  in-context, this overarching view of the whole process exploits the innate recurrence
  dynamics of LLMs, expanding their idea exploration with merely one or a few queries.
  Our technique outperforms earlier single-query methods and even more recent multi-query
  strategies that employ an extensive tree search algorithms while using significantly
  fewer tokens. Intriguingly, our results suggest that instructing an LLM using an
  algorithm can lead to performance surpassing that of the algorithm itself, hinting
  at LLM’s inherent ability to weave its intuition into optimized searches. We probe
  into the underpinnings of our method’s efficacy and its nuances in application.
