title: 'Log Neural Controlled Differential Equations: The Lie Brackets Make A Difference'
openreview: 0tYrMtQyPT
abstract: The vector field of a controlled differential equation (CDE) describes the
  relationship between a <em>control</em> path and the evolution of a <em>solution</em>
  path. Neural CDEs (NCDEs) treat time series data as observations from a control
  path, parameterise a CDE’s vector field using a neural network, and use the solution
  path as a continuously evolving hidden state. As their formulation makes them robust
  to irregular sampling rates, NCDEs are a powerful approach for modelling real-world
  data. Building on neural rough differential equations (NRDEs), we introduce Log-NCDEs,
  a novel, effective, and efficient method for training NCDEs. The core component
  of Log-NCDEs is the Log-ODE method, a tool from the study of rough paths for approximating
  a CDE’s solution. Log-NCDEs are shown to outperform NCDEs, NRDEs, the linear recurrent
  unit, S5, and MAMBA on a range of multivariate time series datasets with up to $50{,}000$
  observations.
