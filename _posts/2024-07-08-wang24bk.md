title: 'Distributed High-Dimensional Quantile Regression: Estimation Efficiency and
  Support Recovery'
openreview: PDUQRBPkks
abstract: In this paper, we focus on distributed estimation and support recovery for
  high-dimensional linear quantile regression. Quantile regression is a popular alternative
  tool to the least squares regression for robustness against outliers and data heterogeneity.
  However, the non-smoothness of the check loss function poses big challenges to both
  computation and theory in the distributed setting. To tackle these problems, we
  transform the original quantile regression into the least-squares optimization.
  By applying a double-smoothing approach, we extend a previous Newton-type distributed
  approach without the restrictive independent assumption between the error term and
  covariates. An efficient algorithm is developed, which enjoys high computation and
  communication efficiency. Theoretically, the proposed distributed estimator achieves
  a near-oracle convergence rate and high support recovery accuracy after a constant
  number of iterations. Extensive experiments on synthetic examples and a real data
  application further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
