title: Empowering Graph Invariance Learning with Deep Spurious Infomax
openreview: u9oSQtujCF
abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in developing graph neural
  networks that utilize the invariance principle on graphs to generalize the out-of-distribution
  (OOD) data. Due to the limited knowledge about OOD data, existing approaches often
  pose assumptions about the correlation strengths of the underlying spurious features
  and the target labels. However, this prior is often unavailable and will change
  arbitrarily in the real-world scenarios, which may lead to severe failures of the
  existing graph invariance learning methods. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel
  graph invariance learning paradigm, which induces a robust and general inductive
  bias, which is built upon the observation that the infomax principle encourages
  learning spurious features regardless of spurious correlation strengths. We further
  propose the EQuAD framework that realizes this learning paradigm and employs tailored
  learning objectives that provably elicit invariant features by disentangling them
  from the spurious features learned through infomax. Notably, EQuAD shows stable
  and enhanced performance across different degrees of bias in synthetic datasets
  and challenging real-world datasets up to 31.76%.
