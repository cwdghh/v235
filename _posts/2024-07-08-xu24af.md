title: 'Sparse Inducing Points in Deep Gaussian Processes: Enhancing Modeling with
  Denoising Diffusion Variational Inference'
openreview: jTn4AIOgpM
abstract: Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) provide a robust paradigm in Bayesian deep
  learning. In DGPs, a set of sparse integration locations called inducing points
  are selected to approximate the posterior distribution of the model. This is done
  to reduce computational complexity and improve model efficiency. However, inferring
  the posterior distribution of inducing points is not straightforward. Traditional
  variational inference techniques methods to approximate the posterior often leads
  to significant bias. To address this issue, we propose an alternative named Denoising
  Diffusion Variational Inference (DDVI) that utilizes a denoising diffusion stochastic
  differential equation (SDE) for generating posterior samples of inducing variables.
  We refer to the score matching method in the denoising diffusion model to approximate
  challenging score functions using a neural network. Furthermore, by combining classical
  mathematical theory of SDE with the minimization of KL divergence between the approximate
  and true processes, we propose a novel explicit variational lower bound for the
  marginal likelihood function of DGP. Through extensive experiments on various datasets
  and comparisons with baseline methods, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness
  of the DDVI method in posterior inference of inducing points for DGP models.
