title: Efficient Black-box Adversarial Attacks via Bayesian Optimization Guided by
  a Function Prior
openreview: CR6Sl80cn8
abstract: This paper studies the challenging black-box adversarial attack that aims
  to generate adversarial examples against a black-box model by only using output
  feedback of the model to input queries. Some previous methods improve the query
  efficiency by incorporating the gradient of a surrogate white-box model into query-based
  attacks due to the adversarial transferability. However, the localized gradient
  is not informative enough, making these methods still query-intensive. In this paper,
  we propose a Prior-guided Bayesian Optimization (P-BO) algorithm that leverages
  the surrogate model as a global function prior in black-box adversarial attacks.
  As the surrogate model contains rich prior information of the black-box one, P-BO
  models the attack objective with a Gaussian process whose mean function is initialized
  as the surrogate modelâ€™s loss. Our theoretical analysis on the regret bound indicates
  that the performance of P-BO may be affected by a bad prior. Therefore, we further
  propose an adaptive integration strategy to automatically adjust a coefficient on
  the function prior by minimizing the regret bound. Extensive experiments on image
  classifiers and large vision-language models demonstrate the superiority of the
  proposed algorithm in reducing queries and improving attack success rates compared
  with the state-of-the-art black-box attacks. Code is available at https://github.com/yibo-miao/PBO-Attack.
