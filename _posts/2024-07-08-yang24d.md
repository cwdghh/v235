title: 'DoraemonGPT: Toward Understanding Dynamic Scenes with Large Language Models
  (Exemplified as A Video Agent)'
openreview: QMy2RLnxGN
abstract: 'Recent LLM-driven visual agents mainly focus on solving image-based tasks,
  which limits their ability to understand dynamic scenes, making it far from real-life
  applications like guiding students in laboratory experiments and identifying their
  mistakes. Hence, this paper explores DoraemonGPT, a comprehensive and conceptually
  elegant system driven by LLMs to understand dynamic scenes. Considering the video
  modality better reflects the ever-changing nature of real-world scenarios, we exemplify
  DoraemonGPT as a video agent. Given a video with a question/task, DoraemonGPT begins
  by converting the input video into a symbolic memory that stores task-related attributes.
  This structured representation allows for spatial-temporal querying and reasoning
  by well-designed sub-task tools, resulting in concise intermediate results. Recognizing
  that LLMs have limited internal knowledge when it comes to specialized domains (e.g.,
  analyzing the scientific principles underlying experiments), we incorporate plug-and-play
  tools to assess external knowledge and address tasks across different domains. Moreover,
  a novel LLM-driven planner based on Monte Carlo Tree Search is introduced to explore
  the large planning space for scheduling various tools. The planner iteratively finds
  feasible solutions by backpropagating the result’s reward, and multiple solutions
  can be summarized into an improved final answer. We extensively evaluate DoraemonGPT’s
  effectiveness on three benchmarks and several in-the-wild scenarios. Project page:
