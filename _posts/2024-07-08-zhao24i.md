title: 'Absolute Policy Optimization: Enhancing Lower Probability Bound of Performance
  with High Confidence'
openreview: Ss3h1ixJAU
abstract: In recent years, trust region on-policy reinforcement learning has achieved
  impressive results in addressing complex control tasks and gaming scenarios. However,
  contemporary state-of-the-art algorithms within this category primarily emphasize
  improvement in expected performance, lacking the ability to control over the worst-case
  performance outcomes. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel objective
  function, optimizing which leads to guaranteed monotonic improvement in the lower
  probability bound of performance with high confidence. Building upon this groundbreaking
  theoretical advancement, we further introduce a practical solution called Absolute
  Policy Optimization (APO). Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
  approach across challenging continuous control benchmark tasks and extend its applicability
  to mastering Atari games. Our findings reveal that APO as well as its efficient
  variation Proximal Absolute Policy Optimization (PAPO) significantly outperforms
  state-of-the-art policy gradient algorithms, resulting in substantial improvements
  in worst-case performance, as well as expected performance.
