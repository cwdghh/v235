title: 'SciBench: Evaluating College-Level Scientific Problem-Solving Abilities of
  Large Language Models'
openreview: bq1JEgioLr
abstract: Most existing Large Language Model (LLM) benchmarks on scientific problem
  reasoning focus on problems grounded in high-school subjects and are confined to
  elementary algebraic operations. To systematically examine the reasoning capabilities
  required for solving complex scientific problems, we introduce an expansive benchmark
  suite SciBench for LLMs. SciBench contains a carefully curated dataset featuring
  a range of collegiate-level scientific problems from mathematics, chemistry, and
  physics domains. Based on the dataset, we conduct an in-depth benchmarking study
  of representative open-source and proprietary LLMs with various prompting strategies.
  The results reveal that current LLMs fall short of delivering satisfactory performance,
  with the best overall score of merely 43.22%. Furthermore, through a detailed user
  study, we categorize the errors made by LLMs into ten problem-solving abilities.
  Our analysis indicates that no single prompting strategy significantly outperforms
  the others and some strategies that demonstrate improvements in certain problem-solving
  skills could result in declines in other skills. We envision that SciBench will
  catalyze further developments in the reasoning abilities of LLMs, thereby ultimately
  contributing to scientific research and discovery.
