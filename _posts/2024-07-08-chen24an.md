title: Recovering Labels from Local Updates in Federated Learning
openreview: E41gvBG4s6
abstract: Gradient inversion (GI) attacks present a threat to the privacy of clients
  in federated learning (FL) by aiming to enable reconstruction of the clientsâ€™ data
  from communicated model updates. A number of such techniques attempts to accelerate
  data recovery by first reconstructing labels of the samples used in local training.
  However, existing label extraction methods make strong assumptions that typically
  do not hold in realistic FL settings. In this paper we present a novel label recovery
  scheme, Recovering Labels from Local Updates (RLU), which provides near-perfect
  accuracy when attacking untrained (most vulnerable) models. More significantly,
  RLU achieves high performance even in realistic real-world settings where the clients
  in an FL system run multiple local epochs, train on heterogeneous data, and deploy
  various optimizers to minimize different objective functions. Specifically, RLU
  estimates labels by solving a least-square problem that emerges from the analysis
  of the correlation between labels of the data points used in a training round and
  the resulting update of the output layer. The experimental results on several datasets,
  architectures, and data heterogeneity scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method
  consistently outperforms existing baselines, and helps improve quality of the reconstructed
  images in GI attacks in terms of both PSNR and LPIPS.
