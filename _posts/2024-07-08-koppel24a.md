title: Information-Directed Pessimism for Offline Reinforcement Learning
openreview: JOKOsJHSao
abstract: Policy optimization from batch data, i.e., offline reinforcement learning
  (RL) is important when collecting data from a current policy is not possible. This
  setting incurs distribution mismatch between batch training data and trajectories
  from the current policy. Pessimistic offsets estimate mismatch using concentration
  bounds, which possess strong theoretical guarantees and simplicity of implementation.
  Mismatch may be conservative in sparse data regions and less so otherwise, which
  can result in under-performing their no-penalty variants in practice. We derive
  a new pessimistic penalty as the distance between the data and the true distribution
  using an evaluable one-sample test known as Stein Discrepancy that requires minimal
  smoothness conditions, and noticeably, allows a mixture family representation of
  distribution over next states. This entity forms a quantifier of information in
  offline data, which justifies calling this approach <em>information-directed pessimism</em>
  (IDP) for offline RL. We further establish that this new penalty based on discrete
  Stein discrepancy yields practical gains in performance while generalizing the regret
  of prior art to multimodal distributions.
