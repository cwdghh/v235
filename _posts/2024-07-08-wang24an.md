title: Open Ad Hoc Teamwork with Cooperative Game Theory
openreview: RlibRvH4B4
abstract: Ad hoc teamwork poses a challenging problem, requiring the design of an
  agent to collaborate with teammates without prior coordination or joint training.
  Open ad hoc teamwork (OAHT) further complicates this challenge by considering environments
  with a changing number of teammates, referred to as open teams. One promising solution
  in practice to this problem is leveraging the generalizability of graph neural networks
  to handle an unrestricted number of agents with various agent-types, named graph-based
  policy learning (GPL). However, its joint Q-value representation over a coordination
  graph lacks convincing explanations. In this paper, we establish a new theory to
  understand the representation of the joint Q-value for OAHT and its learning paradigm,
  through the lens of cooperative game theory. Building on our theory, we propose
  a novel algorithm named CIAO, based on GPLâ€™s framework, with additional provable
  implementation tricks that can facilitate learning. The demos of experimental results
  are available on https://sites.google.com/view/ciao2024, and the code of experiments
  is published on https://github.com/hsvgbkhgbv/CIAO.
