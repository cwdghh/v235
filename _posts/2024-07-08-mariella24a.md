title: Quantum Theory and Application of Contextual Optimal Transport
openreview: A9hJvQHEEP
abstract: Optimal Transport (OT) has fueled machine learning (ML) across many domains.
  When paired data measurements $(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{\nu})$ are coupled
  to covariates, a challenging conditional distribution learning setting arises. Existing
  approaches for learning a <em>global</em> transport map parameterized through a
  potentially unseen context utilize Neural OT and largely rely on Brenierâ€™s theorem.
  Here, we propose a first-of-its-kind quantum computing formulation for amortized
  optimization of contextualized transportation plans. We exploit a direct link between
  doubly stochastic matrices and unitary operators thus unravelling a natural connection
  between OT and quantum computation. We verify our method (QontOT) on synthetic and
  real data by predicting variations in cell type distributions conditioned on drug
  dosage. Importantly we conduct a 24-qubit hardware experiment on a task challenging
  for classical computers and report a performance that cannot be matched with our
  classical neural OT approach. In sum, this is a first step toward learning to predict
  contextualized transportation plans through quantum computing.
