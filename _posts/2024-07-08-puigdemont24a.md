title: Learning to Remove Cuts in Integer Linear Programming
openreview: k10805cgak
abstract: 'Cutting plane methods are a fundamental approach for solving integer linear
  programs (ILPs). In each iteration of such methods, additional linear constraints
  (cuts) are introduced to the constraint set with the aim of excluding the previous
  fractional optimal solution while not affecting the optimal integer solution. In
  this work, we explore a novel approach within cutting plane methods: instead of
  only adding new cuts, we also consider the removal of previous cuts introduced at
  any of the preceding iterations of the method under a learnable parametric criteria.
  We demonstrate that in fundamental combinatorial optimization settings such cut
  removal policies can lead to significant improvements over both human-based and
  machine learning-guided cut addition policies even when implemented with simple
  models.'
