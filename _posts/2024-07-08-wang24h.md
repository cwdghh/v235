title: Executable Code Actions Elicit Better LLM Agents
openreview: jJ9BoXAfFa
abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, capable of performing a broad range of
  actions, such as invoking tools and controlling robots, show great potential in
  tackling real-world challenges. LLM agents are typically prompted to produce actions
  by generating JSON or text in a pre-defined format, which is usually limited by
  constrained action space (e.g., the scope of pre-defined tools) and restricted flexibility
  (e.g., inability to compose multiple tools). This work proposes to use executable
  Python <b>code</b> to consolidate LLM agentsâ€™ <b>act</b>ions into a unified action
  space (<b>CodeAct</b>). Integrated with a Python interpreter, CodeAct can execute
  code actions and dynamically revise prior actions or emit new actions upon new observations
  through multi-turn interactions. Our extensive analysis of 17 LLMs on API-Bank and
  a newly curated benchmark shows that CodeAct outperforms widely used alternatives
  (up to 20% higher success rate). The encouraging performance of CodeAct motivates
  us to build an open-source LLM agent that interacts with environments by executing
  interpretable code and collaborates with users using natural language. To this end,
  we collect an instruction-tuning dataset CodeActInstruct that consists of 7k multi-turn
  interactions using CodeAct. We show that it can be used with existing data to improve
  models in agent-oriented tasks without compromising their general capability. CodeActAgent,
  finetuned from Llama2 and Mistral, is integrated with Python interpreter and uniquely
  tailored to perform sophisticated tasks (e.g., model training) using existing libraries
  and autonomously self-debug.
