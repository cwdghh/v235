title: Improved Dimensionality Dependence for Zeroth-Order Optimisation over Cross-Polytopes
openreview: D7wi9LIE6i
abstract: This work proposes an algorithm improving the dimensionality dependence
  for gradient-free optimisation over cross-polytopes, which has many applications
  such as adversarial attacks, explainable AI and sparse regression. For bandit convex
  optimisation with two-point feedback over cross-polytopes, the state-of-the-art
  algorithms have a dimensionality dependence of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d\log d})$, while
  the known lower bound is of the form $\Omega(\sqrt{d(\log d)^{-1}})$. We propose
  a mirror descent algorithm equipped with a symmetric version of the negative $\frac{1}{2}$-Tsallis
  entropy. Combined with an $\ell_1$-ellipsoidal smoothing-based gradient estimator,
  the proposed algorithm guarantees a dimensionality dependence on $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{d})$,
  which improves the state-of-the-art algorithms by a factor of $\sqrt{\log d}$. The
  idea can be further applied to optimising non-smooth and non-convex functions. We
  propose an algorithm with a convergence depending on $\mathcal{O}(d)$, which is
  the best-known dimensionality dependence.
