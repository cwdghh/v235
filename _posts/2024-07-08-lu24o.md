title: 'DiNADO: Norm-Disentangled Neurally-Decomposed Oracles for Controlling Language
  Models'
openreview: pvg1OdUtDQ
abstract: NeurAlly-Decomposed Oracle (NADO) is a powerful approach for controllable
  generation with large language models. It is designed to avoid catastrophic forgetting
  while achieving guaranteed convergence to an entropy-maximized closed-form optimal
  solution with reasonable modeling capacity. Despite the success, several challenges
  arise when apply NADO to a wide range of scenarios. Vanilla NADO suffers from gradient
  vanishing for low-probability control signals and is highly reliant on a regularization
  to satisfy the stochastic version of Bellman equation. In addition, the vanilla
  implementation of NADO introduces a few additional transformer layers, suffering
  from a limited capacity especially compared to other finetune-based model adaptation
  methods like LoRA. In this paper, we propose a improved version of the NADO algorithm,
  namely DiNADO (norm-<b>Di</b>sentangled <b>N</b>eur<b>A</b>lly-<b>D</b>ecomposed
  <b>O</b>racles), which improves the performance of the NADO algorithm through disentangling
  the step-wise global norm over the approximated oracle $R$-value for all potential
  next-tokens, allowing DiNADO to be combined with finetuning methods like LoRA. We
  discuss in depth how DiNADO achieves better capacity, stability and flexibility
  with both empirical and theoretical results. Experiments on formality control in
  machine translation and the lexically constrained generation task CommonGen demonstrates
  the significance of the improvements.
