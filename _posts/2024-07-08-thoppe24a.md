title: 'Risk Estimation in a Markov Cost Process: Lower and Upper Bounds'
openreview: 7xzhKEPfBo
abstract: We tackle the problem of estimating risk measures of the infinite-horizon
  discounted cost of a Markov cost process. The risk measures we study include variance,
  Value-at-Risk (VaR), and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). First, we show that estimating
  any of these risk measures with $\epsilon$-accuracy, either in expected or high-probability
  sense, requires at least $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ samples. Then, using a truncation
  scheme, we derive an upper bound for the CVaR and variance estimation. This bound
  matches our lower bound up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we discuss an extension
  of our estimation scheme that covers more general risk measures satisfying a certain
  continuity criterion, such as spectral risk measures and utility-based shortfall
  risk. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to provide lower and upper
  bounds for estimating any risk measure beyond the mean within a Markovian setting.
  Our lower bounds also extend to the infinite-horizon discounted costsâ€™ mean. Even
  in that case, our lower bound of $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2) $ improves upon the existing
  $\Omega(1/\epsilon)$ bound (Metelli et al. 2023.
