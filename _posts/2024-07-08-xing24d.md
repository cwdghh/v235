title: 'SpikeLM: Towards General Spike-Driven Language Modeling via Elastic Bi-Spiking
  Mechanisms'
openreview: 4PB1RMsUy4
abstract: Towards energy-efficient artificial intelligence similar to the human brain,
  the bio-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) have advantages of biological plausibility,
  event-driven sparsity, and binary activation. Recently, large-scale language models
  exhibit promising generalization capability, making it a valuable issue to explore
  more general spike-driven models. However, the binary spikes in existing SNNs fail
  to encode adequate semantic information, placing technological challenges for generalization.
  This work proposes the first fully spiking mechanism for general language tasks,
  including both discriminative and generative ones. Different from previous spikes
  with 0,1 levels, we propose a more general spike formulation with bi-directional,
  elastic amplitude, and elastic frequency encoding, while still maintaining the addition
  nature of SNNs. In a single time step, the spike is enhanced by direction and amplitude
  information; in spike frequency, a strategy to control spike firing rate is well
  designed. We plug this elastic bi-spiking mechanism in language modeling, named
  SpikeLM. It is the first time to handle general language tasks with fully spike-driven
  models, which achieve much higher accuracy than previously possible. SpikeLM also
  greatly bridges the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs in language modeling.
