title: Provably Efficient Long-Horizon Exploration in Monte Carlo Tree Search through
  State Occupancy Regularization
openreview: UCKFhc9SFC
abstract: Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) has been successful in a variety of domains,
  but faces challenges with long-horizon exploration when compared to sampling-based
  motion planning algorithms like Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees. To address these
  limitations of MCTS, we derive a tree search algorithm based on policy optimization
  with state-occupancy measure regularization, which we call <em>Volume-MCTS</em>.
  We show that count-based exploration and sampling-based motion planning can be derived
  as approximate solutions to this state-occupancy measure regularized objective.
  We test our method on several robot navigation problems, and find that Volume-MCTS
  outperforms AlphaZero and displays significantly better long-horizon exploration
  properties.
