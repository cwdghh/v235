title: Feature Attribution with Necessity and Sufficiency via Dual-stage Perturbation
  Test for Causal Explanation
openreview: J6prHJsIlf
abstract: We investigate the problem of explainability for machine learning models,
  focusing on Feature Attribution Methods (FAMs) that evaluate feature importance
  through perturbation tests. Despite their utility, FAMs struggle to distinguish
  the contributions of different features, when their prediction changes are similar
  after perturbation. To enhance FAMs’ discriminative power, we introduce Feature
  Attribution with Necessity and Sufficiency (FANS), which find a neighborhood of
  the input such that perturbing samples within this neighborhood have a high Probability
  of being Necessity and Sufficiency (PNS) cause for the change in predictions, and
  use this PNS as the importance of the feature. Specifically, FANS compute this PNS
  via a heuristic strategy for estimating the neighborhood and a perturbation test
  involving two stages (factual and interventional) for counterfactual reasoning.
  To generate counterfactual samples, we use a resampling-based approach on the observed
  samples to approximate the required conditional distribution. We demonstrate that
  FANS outperforms existing attribution methods on six benchmarks. Please refer to
