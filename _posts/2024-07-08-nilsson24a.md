title: 'REMEDI: Corrective Transformations for Improved Neural Entropy Estimation'
openreview: 321GwKMtxO
abstract: Information theoretic quantities play a central role in machine learning.
  The recent surge in the complexity of data and models has increased the demand for
  accurate estimation of these quantities. However, as the dimension grows the estimation
  presents significant challenges, with existing methods struggling already in relatively
  low dimensions. To address this issue, in this work, we introduce REMEDI for efficient
  and accurate estimation of differential entropy, a fundamental information theoretic
  quantity. The approach combines the minimization of the cross-entropy for simple,
  adaptive base models and the estimation of their deviation, in terms of the relative
  entropy, from the data density. Our approach demonstrates improvement across a broad
  spectrum of estimation tasks, encompassing entropy estimation on both synthetic
  and natural data. Further, we extend important theoretical consistency results to
  a more generalized setting required by our approach. We illustrate how the framework
  can be naturally extended to information theoretic supervised learning models, with
  a specific focus on the Information Bottleneck approach. It is demonstrated that
  the method delivers better accuracy compared to the existing methods in Information
  Bottleneck. In addition, we explore a natural connection between REMEDI and generative
  modeling using rejection sampling and Langevin dynamics.
