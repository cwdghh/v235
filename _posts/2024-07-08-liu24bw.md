title: Building Socially-Equitable Public Models
openreview: PudBRuNa8r
abstract: Public models offer predictions to a variety of downstream tasks and have
  played a crucial role in various AI applications, showcasing their proficiency in
  accurate predictions. However, the exclusive emphasis on prediction accuracy may
  not align with the diverse end objectives of downstream agents. Recognizing the
  public modelâ€™s predictions as a service, we advocate for integrating the objectives
  of downstream agents into the optimization process. Concretely, to address performance
  disparities and foster fairness among heterogeneous agents in training, we propose
  a novel Equitable Objective. This objective, coupled with a policy gradient algorithm,
  is crafted to train the public model to produce a more equitable/uniform performance
  distribution across downstream agents, each with their unique concerns. Both theoretical
  analysis and empirical case studies have proven the effectiveness of our method
  in advancing performance equity across diverse downstream agents utilizing the public
  model for their decision-making. Codes and datasets are released at https://github.com/Ren-Research/Socially-Equitable-Public-Models.
