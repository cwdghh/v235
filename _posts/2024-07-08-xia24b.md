title: 'Refined Coreset Selection: Towards Minimal Coreset Size under Model Performance
  Constraints'
openreview: yb5xV8LFDq
abstract: Coreset selection is powerful in reducing computational costs and accelerating
  data processing for deep learning algorithms. It strives to identify a small subset
  from large-scale data, so that training only on the subset practically performs
  on par with full data. Practitioners regularly desire to identify the smallest possible
  coreset in realistic scenes while maintaining comparable model performance, to minimize
  costs and maximize acceleration. Motivated by this desideratum, for the first time,
  we pose the problem of refined coreset selection, in which the minimal coreset size
  under model performance constraints is explored. Moreover, to address this problem,
  we propose an innovative method, which maintains optimization priority order over
  the model performance and coreset size, and efficiently optimizes them in the coreset
  selection procedure. Theoretically, we provide the convergence guarantee of the
  proposed method. Empirically, extensive experiments confirm its superiority compared
  with previous strategies, often yielding better model performance with smaller coreset
  sizes. The implementation is available at https://github.com/xiaoboxia/LBCS.
