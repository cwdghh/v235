title: Gibbs Sampling of Continuous Potentials on a Quantum Computer
openreview: iGMTxygzcJ
abstract: Gibbs sampling from continuous real-valued functions is a challenging problem
  of interest in machine learning. Here we leverage quantum Fourier transforms to
  build a quantum algorithm for this task when the function is periodic. We use the
  quantum algorithms for solving linear ordinary differential equations to solve the
  Fokkerâ€“Planck equation and prepare a quantum state encoding the Gibbs distribution.
  We show that the efficiency of interpolation and differentiation of these functions
  on a quantum computer depends on the rate of decay of the Fourier coefficients of
  the Fourier transform of the function. We view this property as a concentration
  of measure in the Fourier domain, and also provide functional analytic conditions
  for it. Our algorithm makes zeroeth order queries to a quantum oracle of the function
  and achieves polynomial quantum speedups in mean estimation in the Gibbs measure
  for generic non-convex periodic functions. At high temperatures the algorithm also
  allows for exponentially improved precision in sampling from Morse functions.
