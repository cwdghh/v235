title: Foundations of Testing for Finite-Sample Causal Discovery
openreview: oUmXcewb83
abstract: Discovery of causal relationships is a fundamental goal of science and vital
  for sound decision making. As such, there has been considerable interest in causal
  discovery methods with provable guarantees. Existing works have thus far largely
  focused on discovery under hard intervention and infinite-samples, in which intervening
  on a node readily reveals the orientation of every edge incident to the node. This
  setup however overlooks the stochasticity inherent in real-world, finite-sample
  settings. Our work takes a step towards studying finite-sample causal discovery,
  wherein multiple interventions on a node are now needed for edge orientation. In
  this work, we study the canonical setup in theoretical causal discovery literature,
  where one assumes causal sufficiency and access to the graph skeleton. Our key observation
  is that discovery may be viewed as structured, multiple testing, and we develop
  a novel testing framework to this end. Crucially, our framework allows for anytime
  valid testing as multiple tests are needed to conclude an edge orientation. It also
  allows for flexible combination of structured test-statistics (enabling one to use
  Meek rules to propagate edge orientation) as well as robust testing. Through empirical
  simulations, we confirm the usefulness of our framework. In closing, using this
  testing framework, we show how one may efficiently verify graph structure by drawing
  a connection to multi-constraint bandits and designing a novel algorithm to this
  end.
