title: The Emergence of Reproducibility and Consistency in Diffusion Models
openreview: HsliOqZkc0
abstract: 'In this work, we investigate an intriguing and prevalent phenomenon of
  diffusion models which we term as "consistent model reproducibility”: given the
  same starting noise input and a deterministic sampler, different diffusion models
  often yield remarkably similar outputs. We confirm this phenomenon through comprehensive
  experiments, implying that different diffusion models consistently reach the same
  data distribution and score function regardless of diffusion model frameworks, model
  architectures, or training procedures. More strikingly, our further investigation
  implies that diffusion models are learning <em>distinct distributions</em> influenced
  by the training data size. This is evident in two distinct training regimes: (I)
  "memorization regime,” where the diffusion model overfits to the training data distribution,
  and (ii) "generalization regime,” where the model learns the underlying data distribution.
  Our study also finds that this valuable property generalizes to many variants of
  diffusion models, including those for conditional generation and solving inverse
  problems. Lastly, we discuss how our findings connect to existing research and highlight
  the practical implications of our discoveries.'
