title: Learning Shadow Variable Representation for Treatment Effect Estimation under
  Collider Bias
openreview: ycXo4tQIpN
abstract: One of the significant challenges in treatment effect estimation is collider
  bias, a specific form of sample selection bias induced by the common causes of both
  the treatment and outcome. Identifying treatment effects under collider bias requires
  well-defined shadow variables in observational data, which are assumed to be related
  to the outcome and independent of the sample selection mechanism, conditional on
  the other observed variables. However, finding a valid shadow variable is not an
  easy task in real-world scenarios and requires domain-specific knowledge from experts.
  Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel method that can automatically learn
  shadow-variable representations from observational data without prior knowledge.
  To ensure the learned representations satisfy the assumptions of the shadow variable,
  we introduce a tester to perform hypothesis testing in the representation learning
  process. We iteratively generate representations and test whether they satisfy the
  shadow-variable assumptions until they pass the test. With the help of the learned
  shadow-variable representations, we propose a novel treatment effect estimator to
  address collider bias. Experiments show that the proposed methods outperform existing
  treatment effect estimation methods under collider bias and prove their potential
  application value.
