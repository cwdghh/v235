title: Single-Model Attribution of Generative Models Through Final-Layer Inversion
openreview: Hs9GcILuZN
abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative modeling have sparked interest in practical
  single-model attribution. Such methods predict whether a sample was generated by
  a specific generator or not, for instance, to prove intellectual property theft.
  However, previous works are either limited to the closed-world setting or require
  undesirable changes to the generative model. We address these shortcomings by, first,
  viewing single-model attribution through the lens of anomaly detection. Arising
  from this change of perspective, we propose FLIPAD, a new approach for single-model
  attribution in the open-world setting based on final-layer inversion and anomaly
  detection. We show that the utilized final-layer inversion can be reduced to a convex
  lasso optimization problem, making our approach theoretically sound and computationally
  efficient. The theoretical findings are accompanied by an experimental study demonstrating
  the effectiveness of our approach and its flexibility to various domains.
