title: 'Irregular Multivariate Time Series Forecasting: A Transformable Patching Graph
  Neural Networks Approach'
openreview: UZlMXUGI6e
abstract: Forecasting of Irregular Multivariate Time Series (IMTS) is critical for
  numerous areas, such as healthcare, biomechanics, climate science, and astronomy.
  Despite existing research addressing irregularities in time series through ordinary
  differential equations, the challenge of modeling correlations between asynchronous
  IMTS remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, this study proposes Transformable
  Patching Graph Neural Networks (t-PatchGNN), which transforms each univariate irregular
  time series into a series of transformable patches encompassing a varying number
  of observations with uniform temporal resolution. It seamlessly facilitates local
  semantics capture and inter-time series correlation modeling while avoiding sequence
  length explosion in aligned IMTS. Building on the aligned patching outcomes, we
  then present time-adaptive graph neural networks to model dynamic intertime series
  correlation based on a series of learned time-varying adaptive graphs. We demonstrate
  the remarkable superiority of t-PatchGNN on a comprehensive IMTS forecasting benchmark
  we build, which contains four real-world scientific datasets covering healthcare,
  biomechanics and climate science, and seventeen competitive baselines adapted from
  relevant research fields.
