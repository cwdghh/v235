title: A Field Guide for Pacing Budget and ROS Constraints
openreview: HTMFUKAm8B
abstract: Budget pacing is a popular service that has been offered by major internet
  advertising platforms since their inception. In the past few years, autobidding
  products that provide real-time bidding as a service to advertisers have seen a
  prominent rise in adoption. A popular autobidding stategy is value maximization
  subject to return-on-spend (ROS) constraints. For historical or business reasons,
  the systems that govern these two services, namely budget pacing and ROS pacing,
  are not necessarily always a single unified and coordinated entity that optimizes
  a global objective subject to both constraints. The purpose of this work is to theoretically
  and empirically compare algorithms with different degrees of coordination between
  these two pacing systems. In particular, we compare (a) a fully-decoupled sequential
  algorithm; (b) a minimally-coupled min-pacing algorithm; (c) a fully-coupled dual-based
  algorithm. Our main contribution is to theoretically analyze the min-pacing algorithm
  and show that it attains similar guarantees to the fully-coupled canonical dual-based
  algorithm. On the other hand, we show that the sequential algorithm, even though
  appealing by virtue of being fully decoupled, could badly violate the constraints.
  We validate our theoretical findings empirically by showing that the min-pacing
  algorithm performs almost as well as the canonical dual-based algorithm on a semi-synthetic
  dataset that was generated from a large online advertising platformâ€™s auction data.
