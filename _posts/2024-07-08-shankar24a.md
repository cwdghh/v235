title: On Online Experimentation without Device Identifiers
openreview: merZTLSdC9
abstract: Measuring human feedback via randomized experimentation is a cornerstone
  of data-driven decision-making. The methodology used to estimate user preferences
  from their online behaviours is critically dependent on user identifiers. However,
  in todayâ€™s digital landscape, consumers frequently interact with content across
  multiple devices, which are often recorded with different identifiers for the same
  consumer. The inability to match different device identities across consumers poses
  significant challenges for accurately estimating human preferences and other causal
  effects. Moreover, without strong assumptions about the device-user graph, the causal
  effects might not be identifiable. In this paper, we propose HIFIVE, a variational
  method to solve the problem of estimating global average treatment effects (GATE)
  from a fragmented view of exposures and outcomes. Experiments show that our estimator
  is superior to standard estimators, with a lower bias and greater robustness to
  network uncertainty.
