title: Bring Your Own (Non-Robust) Algorithm to Solve Robust MDPs by Estimating The
  Worst Kernel
openreview: UqoG0YRfQx
abstract: Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) provide a framework for sequential
  decision-making that is robust to perturbations on the transition kernel. However,
  current RMDP methods are often limited to small-scale problems, hindering their
  use in high-dimensional domains. To bridge this gap, we present EWoK, a novel online
  approach to solve RMDP that Estimates the Worst transition Kernel to learn robust
  policies. Unlike previous works that regularize the policy or value updates, EWoK
  achieves robustness by simulating the worst scenarios for the agent while retaining
  complete flexibility in the learning process. Notably, EWoK can be applied on top
  of any off-the-shelf non-robust RL algorithm, enabling easy scaling to high-dimensional
  domains. Our experiments, spanning from simple Cartpole to high-dimensional DeepMind
  Control Suite environments, demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the
  EWoK paradigm as a practical method for learning robust policies.
