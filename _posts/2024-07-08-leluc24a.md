title: Sliced-Wasserstein Estimation with Spherical Harmonics as Control Variates
openreview: 28SEr5iFyT
abstract: The Sliced-Wasserstein (SW) distance between probability measures is defined
  as the average of the Wasserstein distances resulting for the associated one-dimensional
  projections. As a consequence, the SW distance can be written as an integral with
  respect to the uniform measure on the sphere and the Monte Carlo framework can be
  employed for calculating the SW distance. Spherical harmonics are polynomials on
  the sphere that form an orthonormal basis of the set of square-integrable functions
  on the sphere. Putting these two facts together, a new Monte Carlo method, hereby
  referred to as Spherical Harmonics Control Variates (SHCV), is proposed for approximating
  the SW distance using spherical harmonics as control variates. The resulting approach
  is shown to have good theoretical properties, e.g., a no-error property for Gaussian
  measures under a certain form of linear dependency between the variables. Moreover,
  an improved rate of convergence, compared to Monte Carlo, is established for general
  measures. The convergence analysis relies on the Lipschitz property associated to
  the SW integrand. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance
  of SHCV against state-of-the-art methods for SW distance computation.
