title: Knowledge Graphs Can be Learned with Just Intersection Features
openreview: Al5GlVytqi
abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are potent frameworks for knowledge representation
  and reasoning. Nevertheless, KGs are inherently incomplete, leaving numerous uncharted
  relationships and facts awaiting discovery. Deep learning methodologies have proven
  effective in enhancing KG completion by framing it as a link prediction task, where
  the goal is to discern the validity of a triple comprising a head, relation, and
  tail. The significance of structural information in assessing the validity of a
  triple within a KG is well-established. However, quantifying this structural information
  poses a challenge. We need to pinpoint the metric that encapsulates the structural
  information of a triple and smoothly incorporate this metric into the link prediction
  learning process. In this study, we recognize the critical importance of the intersection
  among the $k$-hop neighborhoods of the head, relation, and tail when determining
  the validity of a triple. To address this, we introduce a novel randomized algorithm
  designed to efficiently generate intersection features for candidate triples. Our
  experimental results demonstrate that a straightforward fully-connected network
  leveraging these intersection features can surpass the performance of established
  KG embedding models and even outperform graph neural network baselines. Additionally,
  we highlight the substantial training time efficiency gains achieved by our network
  trained on intersection features.
