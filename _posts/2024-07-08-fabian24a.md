title: 'Adapt and Diffuse: Sample-adaptive Reconstruction via Latent Diffusion Models'
openreview: V3OpGwo68Z
abstract: Inverse problems arise in a multitude of applications, where the goal is
  to recover a clean signal from noisy and possibly (non)linear observations. The
  difficulty of a reconstruction problem depends on multiple factors, such as the
  ground truth signal structure, the severity of the degradation and the complex interactions
  between the above. This results in natural sample-by-sample variation in the difficulty
  of a reconstruction problem. Our key observation is that most existing inverse problem
  solvers lack the ability to adapt their compute power to the difficulty of the reconstruction
  task, resulting in subpar performance and wasteful resource allocation. We propose
  a novel method, <em>severity encoding</em>, to estimate the degradation severity
  of corrupted signals in the latent space of an autoencoder. We show that the estimated
  severity has strong correlation with the true corruption level and can provide useful
  hints on the difficulty of reconstruction problems on a sample-by-sample basis.
  Furthermore, we propose a reconstruction method based on latent diffusion models
  that leverages the predicted degradation severities to fine-tune the reverse diffusion
  sampling trajectory and thus achieve sample-adaptive inference times. Our framework,
  Flash-Diffusion, acts as a wrapper that can be combined with any latent diffusion-based
  baseline solver, imbuing it with sample-adaptivity and acceleration. We perform
  experiments on both linear and nonlinear inverse problems and demonstrate that our
  technique greatly improves the performance of the baseline solver and achieves up
  to $10\times$ acceleration in mean sampling speed.
