title: 'Rethinking Specificity in SBDD: Leveraging Delta Score and Energy-Guided Diffusion'
openreview: 8WSNl2XA9r
abstract: In the field of Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD), deep learning-based
  generative models have achieved outstanding performance in terms of docking score.
  However, further study shows that the existing molecular generative methods and
  docking scores both have lacked consideration in terms of specificity, which means
  that generated molecules bind to almost every protein pocket with high affinity.
  To address this, we introduce the Delta Score, a new metric for evaluating the specificity
  of molecular binding. To further incorporate this insight for generation, we develop
  an innovative energy-guided approach using contrastive learning, with active compounds
  as decoys, to direct generative models toward creating molecules with high specificity.
  Our empirical results show that this method not only enhances the delta score but
  also maintains or improves traditional docking scores, successfully bridging the
  gap between SBDD and real-world needs.
