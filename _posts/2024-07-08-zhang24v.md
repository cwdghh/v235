title: 'Advancing DRL Agents in Commercial Fighting Games: Training, Integration,
  and Agent-Human Alignment'
openreview: eN1T7I7OpZ
abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents have demonstrated impressive success
  in a wide range of game genres. However, existing research primarily focuses on
  optimizing DRL competence rather than addressing the challenge of prolonged player
  interaction. In this paper, we propose a practical DRL agent system for fighting
  games named <em>Shūkai</em>, which has been successfully deployed to Naruto Mobile,
  a popular fighting game with over 100 million registered users. <em>Shūkai</em>
  quantifies the state to enhance generalizability, introducing Heterogeneous League
  Training (HELT) to achieve balanced competence, generalizability, and training efficiency.
  Furthermore, <em>Shūkai</em> implements specific rewards to align the agent’s behavior
  with human expectations. <em>Shūkai</em>’s ability to generalize is demonstrated
  by its consistent competence across all characters, even though it was trained on
  only 13% of them. Additionally, HELT exhibits a remarkable 22% improvement in sample
  efficiency. <em>Shūkai</em> serves as a valuable training partner for players in
  Naruto Mobile, enabling them to enhance their abilities and skills.
