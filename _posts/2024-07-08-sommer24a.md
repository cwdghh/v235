title: 'Connecting the Dots: Is Mode-Connectedness the Key to Feasible Sample-Based
  Inference in Bayesian Neural Networks?'
openreview: tc3Nmcpmnx
abstract: A major challenge in sample-based inference (SBI) for Bayesian neural networks
  is the size and structure of the networks’ parameter space. Our work shows that
  successful SBI is possible by embracing the characteristic relationship between
  weight and function space, uncovering a systematic link between overparameterization
  and the difficulty of the sampling problem. Through extensive experiments, we establish
  practical guidelines for sampling and convergence diagnosis. As a result, we present
  a deep ensemble initialized approach as an effective solution with competitive performance
  and uncertainty quantification.
