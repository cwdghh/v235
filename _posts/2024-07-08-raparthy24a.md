title: Generalization to New Sequential Decision Making Tasks with In-Context Learning
openreview: lVQ4FUZ6dp
abstract: Training autonomous agents that can learn new tasks from only a handful
  of demonstrations is a long-standing problem in machine learning. Recently, transformers
  have been shown to learn new language or vision tasks without any weight updates
  from only a few examples, also referred to as in-context learning. However, the
  sequential decision making setting poses additional challenges having a lower tolerance
  for errors since the environment’s stochasticity or the agent’s actions can lead
  to unseen, and sometimes unrecoverable, states. In this paper, we use an illustrative
  example to show that naively applying transformers to sequential decision making
  problems does not enable in-context learning of new tasks. We then demonstrate how
  training on sequences of trajectories with certain distributional properties leads
  to in-context learning of new sequential decision making tasks. We investigate different
  design choices and find that larger model and dataset sizes, as well as more task
  diversity, environment stochasticity, and trajectory burstiness, all result in better
  in-context learning of new out-of-distribution tasks. By training on large diverse
  offline datasets, our model is able to learn new MiniHack and Procgen tasks without
  any weight updates from just a handful of demonstrations.
