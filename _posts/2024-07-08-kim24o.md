title: 'Symmetric Replay Training: Enhancing Sample Efficiency in Deep Reinforcement
  Learning for Combinatorial Optimization'
openreview: cmD5E6ami4
abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has significantly advanced the field of
  combinatorial optimization (CO). However, its practicality is hindered by the necessity
  for a large number of reward evaluations, especially in scenarios involving computationally
  intensive function assessments. To enhance the sample efficiency, we propose a simple
  but effective method, called <em>symmetric replay training (SRT)</em>, which can
  be easily integrated into various DRL methods. Our method leverages high-reward
  samples to encourage exploration of the under-explored symmetric regions without
  additional online interactions - <em>free</em>. Through replay training, the policy
  is trained to maximize the likelihood of the symmetric trajectories of discovered
  high-rewarded samples. Experimental results demonstrate the consistent improvement
  of our method in sample efficiency across diverse DRL methods applied to real-world
  tasks, such as molecular optimization and hardware design.
