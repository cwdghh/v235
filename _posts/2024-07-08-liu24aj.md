title: Two-timescale Derivative Free Optimization for Performative Prediction with
  Markovian Data
openreview: Aj18fUB6Th
abstract: This paper studies the performative prediction problem where a learner aims
  to minimize the expected loss with a decision-dependent data distribution. Such
  setting is motivated when outcomes can be affected by the prediction model, e.g.,
  in strategic classification. We consider a state-dependent setting where the data
  distribution evolves according to an underlying controlled Markov chain. We focus
  on stochastic derivative free optimization (DFO) where the learner is given access
  to a loss function evaluation oracle with the above Markovian data. We propose a
  two-timescale DFO($\lambda$) algorithm that features (i) a sample accumulation mechanism
  that utilizes every observed sample to estimate the overall gradient of performative
  risk, and (ii) a two-timescale diminishing step size that balances the rates of
  DFO updates and bias reduction. Under a general non-convex optimization setting,
  we show that DFO($\lambda$) requires ${\cal O}( 1 /\epsilon^3)$ samples (up to a
  log factor) to attain a near-stationary solution with expected squared gradient
  norm less than $\epsilon > 0$. Numerical experiments verify our analysis.
