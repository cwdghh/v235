title: 'Auctionformer: A Unified Deep Learning Algorithm for Solving Equilibrium Strategies
  in Auction Games'
openreview: VnI9200eeL
abstract: Auction games have been widely used in plenty of trading environments such
  as online advertising and real estate. The complexity of real-world scenarios, characterized
  by diverse auction mechanisms and bidder asymmetries, poses significant challenges
  in efficiently solving for equilibria. Traditional learning approaches often face
  limitations due to their specificity to certain settings and high resource demands.
  Addressing this, we introduce <em>Auctionformer</em>, an efficient transformer-based
  method to solve equilibria of diverse auctions in a unified framework. Leveraging
  the flexible tokenization schemes, Auctionformer translates varying auction games
  into a standard token series, making use of renowned Transformer architectures.
  Moreover, we employ Nash error as the loss term, sidestepping the need for underlying
  equilibrium solutions and enabling efficient training and inference. Furthermore,
  a few-shot framework supports adaptability to new mechanisms, reinforced by a self-supervised
  fine-tuning approach. Extensive experimental results affirm the superior performance
  of Auctionformer over contemporary methods, heralding its potential for broad real-world
  applications.
