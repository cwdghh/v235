title: 'Generalized Preference Optimization: A Unified Approach to Offline Alignment'
openreview: gu3nacA9AH
abstract: Offline preference optimization allows fine-tuning large models directly
  from offline data, and has proved effective in recent alignment practices. We propose
  generalized preference optimization (GPO), a family of offline losses parameterized
  by a general class of convex functions. GPO enables a unified view over preference
  optimization, encompassing existing algorithms such as DPO, IPO and SLiC as special
  cases, while naturally introducing new variants. The GPO framework also sheds light
  on how offline algorithms enforce regularization, through the design of the convex
  function that defines the loss. Our analysis and experiments reveal the connections
  and subtle differences between the offline regularization and the KL divergence
  regularization intended by the canonical RLHF formulation. In a controlled setting
  akin to Gao et al 2023, we also show that different GPO variants achieve similar
  trade-offs between regularization and performance, though the optimal values of
  hyper-parameter might differ as predicted by theory. In all, our results present
  new algorithmic toolkits and empirical insights to alignment practitioners.
