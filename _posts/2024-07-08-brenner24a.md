title: Integrating Multimodal Data for Joint Generative Modeling of Complex Dynamics
openreview: b1iurBHDck
abstract: Many, if not most, systems of interest in science are naturally described
  as nonlinear dynamical systems. Empirically, we commonly access these systems through
  time series measurements. Often such time series may consist of discrete random
  variables rather than continuous measurements, or may be composed of measurements
  from multiple data modalities observed simultaneously. For instance, in neuroscience
  we may have behavioral labels in addition to spike counts and continuous physiological
  recordings. While by now there is a burgeoning literature on deep learning for dynamical
  systems reconstruction (DSR), multimodal data integration has hardly been considered
  in this context. Here we provide such an efficient and flexible algorithmic framework
  that rests on a multimodal variational autoencoder for generating a sparse teacher
  signal that guides training of a reconstruction model, exploiting recent advances
  in DSR training techniques. It enables to combine various sources of information
  for optimal reconstruction, even allows for reconstruction from symbolic data (class
  labels) alone, and connects different types of observations within a common latent
  dynamics space. In contrast to previous multimodal data integration techniques for
  scientific applications, our framework is fully generative, producing, after training,
  trajectories with the same geometrical and temporal structure as those of the ground
  truth system.
