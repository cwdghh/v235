title: A Multimodal Automated Interpretability Agent
openreview: mDw42ZanmE
abstract: 'This paper describes MAIA, a Multimodal Automated Interpretability Agent.
  MAIA is a system that uses neural models to automate neural model understanding
  tasks like feature interpretation and failure mode discovery. It equips a pre-trained
  vision-language model with a set of tools that support iterative experimentation
  on subcomponents of other models to explain their behavior. These include tools
  commonly used by human interpretability researchers: for synthesizing and editing
  inputs, computing maximally activating exemplars from real-world datasets, and summarizing
  and describing experimental results. Interpretability experiments proposed by MAIA
  compose these tools to describe and explain system behavior. We evaluate applications
  of MAIA to computer vision models. We first characterize MAIAâ€™s ability to describe
  (neuron-level) features in learned representations of images. Across several trained
  models and a novel dataset of synthetic vision neurons with paired ground-truth
  descriptions, MAIA produces descriptions comparable to those generated by expert
  human experimenters. We then show that MAIA can aid in two additional interpretability
  tasks: reducing sensitivity to spurious features, and automatically identifying
  inputs likely to be mis-classified.'
