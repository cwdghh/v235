title: 'Identification and Estimation for Nonignorable Missing Data: A Data Fusion
  Approach'
openreview: Z7MzVDFWDV
abstract: We consider the task of identifying and estimating a parameter of interest
  in settings where data is missing not at random (MNAR). In general, such parameters
  are not identified without strong assumptions on the missing data model. In this
  paper, we take an alternative approach and introduce a method inspired by data fusion,
  where information in the MNAR dataset is augmented by information in an auxiliary
  dataset subject to missingness at random (MAR). We show that even if the parameter
  of interest cannot be identified given either dataset alone, it can be identified
  given pooled data, under two complementary sets of assumptions. We derive inverse
  probability weighted (IPW) estimators for identified parameters under both sets
  of assumptions, and evaluate the performance of our estimation strategies via simulation
  studies, and a data application.
