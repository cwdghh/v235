title: How Transformers Learn Causal Structure with Gradient Descent
openreview: jNM4imlHZv
abstract: The incredible success of transformers on sequence modeling tasks can be
  largely attributed to the self-attention mechanism, which allows information to
  be transferred between different parts of a sequence. Self-attention allows transformers
  to encode causal structure which makes them particularly suitable for sequence modeling.
  However, the process by which transformers learn such causal structure via gradient-based
  training algorithms remains poorly understood. To better understand this process,
  we introduce an in-context learning task that requires learning latent causal structure.
  We prove that gradient descent on a simplified two-layer transformer learns to solve
  this task by encoding the latent causal graph in the first attention layer. The
  key insight of our proof is that the gradient of the attention matrix encodes the
  mutual information between tokens. As a consequence of the data processing inequality,
  the largest entries of this gradient correspond to edges in the latent causal graph.
  As a special case, when the sequences are generated from in-context Markov chains,
  we prove that transformers learn an induction head (Olsson et al., 2022). We confirm
  our theoretical findings by showing that transformers trained on our in-context
  learning task are able to recover a wide variety of causal structures.
