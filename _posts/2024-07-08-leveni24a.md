title: Online Isolation Forest
openreview: CbIZatwz9z
abstract: The anomaly detection literature is abundant with offline methods, which
  require repeated access to data in memory, and impose impractical assumptions when
  applied to a streaming context. Existing online anomaly detection methods also generally
  fail to address these constraints, resorting to periodic retraining to adapt to
  the online context. We propose Online-iForest, a novel method explicitly designed
  for streaming conditions that seamlessly tracks the data generating process as it
  evolves over time. Experimental validation on real-world datasets demonstrated that
  Online-iForest is on par with online alternatives and closely rivals state-of-the-art
  offline anomaly detection techniques that undergo periodic retraining. Notably,
  Online-iForest consistently outperforms all competitors in terms of efficiency,
  making it a promising solution in applications where fast identification of anomalies
  is of primary importance such as cybersecurity, fraud and fault detection.
