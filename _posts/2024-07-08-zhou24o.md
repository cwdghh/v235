title: 'CurBench: Curriculum Learning Benchmark'
openreview: Htw0bSgjXE
abstract: 'Curriculum learning is a training paradigm where machine learning models
  are trained in a meaningful order, inspired by the way humans learn curricula. Due
  to its capability to improve model generalization and convergence, curriculum learning
  has gained considerable attention and has been widely applied to various research
  domains. Nevertheless, as new curriculum learning methods continue to emerge, it
  remains an open issue to benchmark them fairly. Therefore, we develop CurBench,
  the first benchmark that supports systematic evaluations for curriculum learning.
  Specifically, it consists of 15 datasets spanning 3 research domains: computer vision,
  natural language processing, and graph machine learning, along with 3 settings:
  standard, noise, and imbalance. To facilitate a comprehensive comparison, we establish
  the evaluation from 2 dimensions: performance and complexity. CurBench also provides
  a unified toolkit that plugs automatic curricula into general machine learning processes,
  enabling the implementation of 15 core curriculum learning methods. On the basis
  of this benchmark, we conduct comparative experiments and make empirical analyses
  of existing methods. CurBench is open-source and publicly available at https://github.com/THUMNLab/CurBench.'
