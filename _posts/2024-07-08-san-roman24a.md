title: Proactive Detection of Voice Cloning with Localized Watermarking
openreview: Bic3Vmy2DG
abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of speech generative models, there is a pressing
  need to ensure audio authenticity against the risks of voice cloning. We present
  AudioSeal, the first audio watermarking technique designed specifically for localized
  detection of AI-generated speech. AudioSeal employs a generator / detector architecture
  trained jointly with a localization loss to enable localized watermark detection
  up to the sample level, and a novel perceptual loss inspired by auditory masking,
  that enables AudioSeal to achieve better imperceptibility. AudioSeal achieves state-of-the-art
  performance in terms of robustness to real life audio manipulations and imperceptibility
  based on automatic and human evaluation metrics. Additionally, AudioSeal is designed
  with a fast, single-pass detector, that significantly surpasses existing models
  in speed, achieving detection up to two orders of magnitude faster, making it ideal
  for large-scale and real-time applications.Code is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/audioseal
