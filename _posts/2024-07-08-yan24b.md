title: Probabilistic Time Series Modeling with Decomposable Denoising Diffusion Model
openreview: BNH8spaR3l
abstract: Probabilistic time series modeling based on generative models has attracted
  lots of attention because of its wide applications and excellent performance. However,
  existing state-of-the-art models, based on stochastic differential equation, not
  only struggle to determine the drift and diffusion coefficients during the design
  process but also have slow generation speed. To tackle this challenge, we firstly
  propose decomposable denoising diffusion model ($\text{D}^3\text{M}$) and prove
  it is a general framework unifying denoising diffusion models and continuous flow
  models. Based on the new framework, we propose some simple but efficient probability
  paths with high generation speed. Furthermore, we design a module that combines
  a special state space model with linear gated attention modules for sequence modeling.
  It preserves inductive bias and simultaneously models both local and global dependencies.
  Experimental results on 8 real-world datasets show that $\text{D}^3\text{M}$ reduces
  RMSE and CRPS by up to 4.6% and 4.3% compared with state-of-the-arts on imputation
  tasks, and achieves comparable results with state-of-the-arts on forecasting tasks
  with only 10 steps.
