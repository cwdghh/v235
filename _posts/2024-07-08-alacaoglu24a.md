title: 'Revisiting Inexact Fixed-Point Iterations for Min-Max Problems: Stochasticity
  and Structured Nonconvexity'
openreview: lWy2lCTyJa
abstract: We focus on constrained, $L$-smooth, potentially stochastic and nonconvex-nonconcave
  min-max problems either satisfying $\rho$-cohypomonotonicity or admitting a solution
  to the $\rho$-weakly Minty Variational Inequality (MVI), where larger values of
  the parameter $\rho>0$ correspond to a greater degree of nonconvexity. These problem
  classes include examples in two player reinforcement learning, interaction dominant
  min-max problems, and certain synthetic test problems on which classical min-max
  algorithms fail. It has been conjectured that first-order methods can tolerate a
  value of $\rho$ no larger than $\frac{1}{L}$, but existing results in the literature
  have stagnated at the tighter requirement $\rho < \frac{1}{2L}$. With a simple argument,
  we obtain optimal or best-known complexity guarantees with cohypomonotonicity or
  weak MVI conditions for $\rho < \frac{1}{L}$. First main insight for the improvements
  in the convergence analyses is to harness the recently proposed <em>conic nonexpansiveness</em>
  property of operators. Second, we provide a refined analysis for inexact Halpern
  iteration that relaxes the required inexactness level to improve some state-of-the-art
  complexity results even for constrained stochastic convex-concave min-max problems.
  Third, we analyze a stochastic inexact Krasnoselâ€™skii-Mann iteration with a multilevel
  Monte Carlo estimator when the assumptions only hold with respect to a solution.
