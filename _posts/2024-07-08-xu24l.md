title: 'BiSHop: Bi-Directional Cellular Learning for Tabular Data with Generalized
  Sparse Modern Hopfield Model'
openreview: r9rzU9QzPe
abstract: 'We introduce the <b>Bi</b>-Directional <b>S</b>parse <b>Hop</b>field Network
  (<b>BiSHop</b>), a novel end-to-end framework for tabular learning. BiSHop handles
  the two major challenges of deep tabular learning: non-rotationally invariant data
  structure and feature sparsity in tabular data. Our key motivation comes from the
  recently established connection between associative memory and attention mechanisms.
  Consequently, BiSHop uses a dual-component approach, sequentially processing data
  both column-wise and row-wise through two interconnected directional learning modules.
  Computationally, these modules house layers of generalized sparse modern Hopfield
  layers, a sparse extension of the modern Hopfield model with learnable sparsity.
  Methodologically, BiSHop facilitates multi-scale representation learning, capturing
  both intra-feature and inter-feature interactions, with adaptive sparsity at each
  scale. Empirically, through experiments on diverse real-world datasets, BiSHop surpasses
  current SOTA methods with significantly fewer HPO runs, marking it a robust solution
  for deep tabular learning. The code is available on GitHub; future updates are on
  arXiv.'
