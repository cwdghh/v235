title: 'A Graph is Worth $K$ Words: Euclideanizing Graph using Pure Transformer'
openreview: zxxSJAVQPc
abstract: 'Can we model Non-Euclidean graphs as pure language or even Euclidean vectors
  while retaining their inherent information? The Non-Euclidean property have posed
  a long term challenge in graph modeling. Despite recent graph neural networks and
  graph transformers efforts encoding graphs as Euclidean vectors, recovering the
  original graph from vectors remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce GraphsGPT,
  featuring an Graph2Seq encoder that transforms Non-Euclidean graphs into learnable
  Graph Words in the Euclidean space, along with a GraphGPT decoder that reconstructs
  the original graph from Graph Words to ensure information equivalence. We pretrain
  GraphsGPT on $100$M molecules and yield some interesting findings: (1) The pretrained
  Graph2Seq excels in graph representation learning, achieving state-of-the-art results
  on $8/9$ graph classification and regression tasks. (2) The pretrained GraphGPT
  serves as a strong graph generator, demonstrated by its strong ability to perform
  both few-shot and conditional graph generation. (3) Graph2Seq+GraphGPT enables effective
  graph mixup in the Euclidean space, overcoming previously known Non-Euclidean challenges.
  (4) The edge-centric pretraining framework GraphsGPT demonstrates its efficacy in
  graph domain tasks, excelling in both representation and generation. Code is available
  at https://github.com/A4Bio/GraphsGPT.'
