title: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Meets Leaf Sequencing in Radiotherapy
openreview: qwKSTLbati
abstract: In contemporary radiotherapy planning (RTP), a key module leaf sequencing
  is predominantly addressed by optimization-based approaches. In this paper, we propose
  a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model termed as <em>Reinforced Leaf Sequencer</em>
  (RLS) in a multi-agent framework for leaf sequencing. The RLS model offers improvements
  to time-consuming iterative optimization steps via large-scale training and can
  control movement patterns through the design of reward mechanisms. We have conducted
  experiments on four datasets with four metrics and compared our model with a leading
  optimization sequencer. Our findings reveal that the proposed RLS model can achieve
  reduced fluence reconstruction errors, and potential faster convergence when integrated
  in an optimization planner. Additionally, RLS has shown promising results in a full
  artificial intelligence RTP pipeline. We hope this pioneer multi-agent RL leaf sequencer
  can foster future research on machine learning for RTP.
