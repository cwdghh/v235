title: 'Actions Speak Louder than Words: Trillion-Parameter Sequential Transducers
  for Generative Recommendations'
openreview: xye7iNsgXn
abstract: Large-scale recommendation systems are characterized by their reliance on
  high cardinality, heterogeneous features and the need to handle tens of billions
  of user actions on a daily basis. Despite being trained on huge volume of data with
  thousands of features, most Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) in industry
  fail to scale with compute. Inspired by success achieved by Transformers in language
  and vision domains, we revisit fundamental design choices in recommendation systems.
  We reformulate recommendation problems as sequential transduction tasks within a
  generative modeling framework (“Generative Recommenders”), and propose a new architecture,
  HSTU, designed for high cardinality, non-stationary streaming recommendation data.
  HSTU outperforms baselines over synthetic and public datasets by up to 65.8% in
  NDCG, and is 5.3x to 15.2x faster than FlashAttention2-based Transformers on 8192
  length sequences. HSTU-based Generative Recommenders, with 1.5 trillion parameters,
  improve metrics in online A/B tests by 12.4% and have been deployed on multiple
  surfaces of a large internet platform with billions of users. More importantly,
  the model quality of Generative Recommenders empirically scales as a power-law of
  training compute across three orders of magnitude, up to GPT-3/LLaMa-2 scale, which
  reduces carbon footprint needed for future model developments, and further paves
  the way for the first foundation models in recommendations.
