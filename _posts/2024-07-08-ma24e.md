title: 'Beyond the Federation: Topology-aware Federated Learning for Generalization
  to Unseen Clients'
openreview: 2zLt2Odckx
abstract: 'Federated Learning is widely employed to tackle distributed sensitive data.
  Existing methods primarily focus on addressing in-federation data heterogeneity.
  However, we observed that they suffer from significant performance degradation when
  applied to unseen clients for out-of-federation (OOF) generalization. The recent
  attempts to address generalization to unseen clients generally struggle to scale
  up to large-scale distributed settings due to high communication or computation
  costs. Moreover, methods that scale well often demonstrate poor generalization capability.
  To achieve OOF-resiliency in a scalable manner, we propose Topology-aware Federated
  Learning (TFL) that leverages client topology - a graph representing client relationships
  - to effectively train robust models against OOF data. We formulate a novel optimization
  problem for TFL, consisting of two key modules: Client Topology Learning, which
  infers the client relationships in a privacy-preserving manner, and Learning on
  Client Topology, which leverages the learned topology to identify influential clients
  and harness this information into the FL optimization process to efficiently build
  robust models. Empirical evaluation on a variety of real-world datasets verifies
  TFLâ€™s superior OOF robustness and scalability.'
