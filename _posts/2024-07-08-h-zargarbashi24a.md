title: Robust Yet Efficient Conformal Prediction Sets
openreview: MrNq6rbcUi
abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) can convert any modelâ€™s output into prediction
  sets guaranteed to include the true label with any user-specified probability. However,
  same as the model itself, CP is vulnerable to adversarial test examples (evasion)
  and perturbed calibration data (poisoning). We derive provably robust sets by bounding
  the worst-case change in conformity scores. Our tighter bounds lead to more efficient
  sets. We cover both continuous and discrete (sparse) data and our guarantees work
  both for evasion and poisoning attacks (on both features and labels).
