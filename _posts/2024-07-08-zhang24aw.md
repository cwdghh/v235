title: A Federated Stochastic Multi-level Compositional Minimax Algorithm for Deep
  AUC Maximization
openreview: NkN6wrYXe5
abstract: AUC maximization is an effective approach to address the imbalanced data
  classification problem in federated learning. In the past few years, a couple of
  federated AUC maximization approaches have been developed based on the minimax optimization.
  However, directly solving a minimax optimization problem to maximize the AUC score
  cannot achieve satisfactory performance. To address this issue, we propose to maximize
  AUC via optimizing a federated multi-level compositional minimax problem. Specifically,
  we develop a novel federated multi-level compositional minimax algorithm with rigorous
  theoretical guarantees to solve this new learning paradigm in both algorithmic design
  and theoretical analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work studying
  the multi-level minimax optimization problem. Additionally, extensive empirical
  evaluations confirm the efficacy of our proposed approach.
