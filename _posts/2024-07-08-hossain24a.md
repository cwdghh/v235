title: Equilibrium of Data Markets with Externality
openreview: S2XgbBCJy0
abstract: We model real-world data markets, where sellers post fixed prices and buyers
  are free to purchase from any set of sellers, as a simultaneous game. A key component
  here is the negative externality buyers induce on one another due to data purchases.
  Starting with a simple setting where buyers know their valuations a priori, we characterize
  both the existence and welfare properties of the pure Nash equilibrium in the presence
  of such externality. While the outcomes are bleak without any intervention, mirroring
  the limitations of current data markets, we prove that for a standard class of externality
  functions, platforms intervening through a transaction cost can lead to a pure equilibrium
  with strong welfare guarantees. We next consider a more realistic setting where
  buyers learn their valuations over time through market interactions. Our intervention
  is feasible here as well, and we consider learning algorithms to achieve low regret
  concerning both individual and cumulative utility metrics. Lastly, we analyze the
  promises of this intervention under a much richer externality model.
