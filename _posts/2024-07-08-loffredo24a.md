title: 'Restoring balance: principled under/oversampling of data for optimal classification'
openreview: rHylzxK3HU
abstract: Class imbalance in real-world data poses a common bottleneck for machine
  learning tasks, since achieving good generalization on under-represented examples
  is often challenging. Mitigation strategies, such as under or oversampling the data
  depending on their abundances, are routinely proposed and tested empirically, but
  how they should adapt to the data statistics remains poorly understood. In this
  work, we determine exact analytical expressions of the generalization curves in
  the high-dimensional regime for linear classifiers (Support Vector Machines). We
  also provide a sharp prediction of the effects of under/oversampling strategies
  depending on class imbalance, first and second moments of the data, and the metrics
  of performance considered. We show that mixed strategies involving under and oversampling
  of data lead to performance improvement. Through numerical experiments, we show
  the relevance of our theoretical predictions on real datasets, on deeper architectures
  and with sampling strategies based on unsupervised probabilistic models.
