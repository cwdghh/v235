title: Learning Causal Dynamics Models in Object-Oriented Environments
openreview: HkWxjpUV0S
abstract: Causal dynamics models (CDMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
  addressing various challenges in reinforcement learning. To learn CDMs, recent studies
  have performed causal discovery to capture the causal dependencies among environmental
  variables. However, the learning of CDMs is still confined to small-scale environments
  due to computational complexity and sample efficiency constraints. This paper aims
  to extend CDMs to large-scale object-oriented environments, which consist of a multitude
  of objects classified into different categories. We introduce the Object-Oriented
  CDM (OOCDM) that shares causalities and parameters among objects belonging to the
  same class. Furthermore, we propose a learning method for OOCDM that enables it
  to adapt to a varying number of objects. Experiments on large-scale tasks indicate
  that OOCDM outperforms existing CDMs in terms of causal discovery, prediction accuracy,
  generalization, and computational efficiency.
