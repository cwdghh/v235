title: Compositional Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning
openreview: t4908PyZxs
abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is proposed to continually learn
  from novel classes with only a few samples after the (pre-)training on base classes
  with sufficient data. However, this remains a challenge. In contrast, humans can
  easily recognize novel classes with a few samples. Cognitive science demonstrates
  that an important component of such human capability is compositional learning.
  This involves identifying visual primitives from learned knowledge and then composing
  new concepts using these transferred primitives, making incremental learning both
  effective and interpretable. To imitate human compositional learning, we propose
  a cognitive-inspired method for the FSCIL task. We define and build a compositional
  model based on set similarities, and then equip it with a primitive composition
  module and a primitive reuse module. In the primitive composition module, we propose
  to utilize the Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) similarity to approximate the similarity
  between primitive sets, allowing the training and evaluation based on primitive
  compositions. In the primitive reuse module, we enhance primitive reusability by
  classifying inputs based on primitives replaced with the closest primitives from
  other classes. Experiments on three datasets validate our method, showing it outperforms
  current state-of-the-art methods with improved interpretability. Our code is available
  at https://github.com/Zoilsen/Comp-FSCIL.
