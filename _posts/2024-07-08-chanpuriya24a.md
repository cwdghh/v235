title: On the Role of Edge Dependency in Graph Generative Models
openreview: 0XDO74NlOd
abstract: 'We investigate the trade-off between the representation power of graph
  generative models and model <em>overlap</em>, i.e., the degree to which the model
  generates diverse outputs versus regurgitating its training data. In particular,
  we delineate a nested hierarchy of graph generative models categorized into three
  levels of complexity: edge independent, node independent, and arbitrarily dependent
  models. This hierarchy encapsulates a wide range of prevalent methods. We derive
  theoretical bounds on the number of triangles and other short-length cycles producible
  by each level of the hierarchy, finding that more complex dependency structure allows
  an improved trade-off between representation power and overlap. We provide instances
  demonstrating the asymptotic optimality of our bounds. Furthermore, we introduce
  new generative models for each of the three hierarchical levels, leveraging dense
  subgraph discovery. Our evaluation, conducted on real-world datasets, focuses on
  assessing the output quality and overlap of our proposed models in comparison to
  other popular models. Our results indicate that our simple, interpretable models
  provide competitive baselines to popular generative models. Through this investigation,
  we offer a structured and robust evaluation scheme, thereby facilitating the development
  of models capable of generating accurate and edge-diverse graphs.'
