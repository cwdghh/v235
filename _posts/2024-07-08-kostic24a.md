title: Consistent Long-Term Forecasting of Ergodic Dynamical Systems
openreview: dfR6FU53qk
abstract: We study the problem of forecasting the evolution of a function of the state
  (observable) of a discrete ergodic dynamical system over multiple time steps. The
  elegant theory of Koopman and transfer operators can be used to evolve any such
  function forward in time. However, their estimators are usually unreliable in long-term
  forecasting. We show how classical techniques of eigenvalue deflation from operator
  theory and feature centering from statistics can be exploited to enhance standard
  estimators. We develop a novel technique to derive high probability bounds on powers
  of empirical estimators. Our approach, rooted in the stability <em>theory of non-normal
  operators</em>, allows us to establish uniform in time bounds for the forecasting
  error, which hold even on <em>infinite time horizons</em>. We further show that
  our approach can be seamlessly employed to forecast future state distributions from
  an initial one, with provably uniform error bounds. Numerical experiments illustrate
  the advantages of our approach in practice.
