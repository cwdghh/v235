title: What needs to go right for an induction head? A mechanistic study of in-context
  learning circuits and their formation
openreview: O8rrXl71D5
abstract: In-context learning is a powerful emergent ability in transformer models.
  Prior work in mechanistic interpretability has identified a circuit element that
  may be critical for in-context learning â€“ the induction head (IH), which performs
  a match-and-copy operation. During training of large transformers on natural language
  data, IHs emerge around the same time as a notable phase change in the loss. Despite
  the robust evidence for IHs and this interesting coincidence with the phase change,
  relatively little is known about the diversity and emergence dynamics of IHs. Why
  is there more than one IH, and how are they dependent on each other? Why do IHs
  appear all of a sudden, and what are the subcircuits that enable them to emerge?
  We answer these questions by studying IH emergence dynamics in a controlled setting
  by training on synthetic data. In doing so, we develop and share a novel optogenetics-inspired
  causal framework for modifying activations throughout training. Using this framework,
  we delineate the diverse and additive nature of IHs. By "clamping" subsets of activations
  throughout training, we then identify three underlying subcircuits that interact
  to drive IH formation, yielding the phase change. Furthermore, these subcircuits
  shed light on data-dependent properties of formation, such as phase change timing,
  already showing the promise of this more in-depth understanding of subcircuits that
  need to "go right" for an induction head.
