title: An Intrinsic Vector Heat Network
openreview: po4NsL9KvX
abstract: Vector fields are widely used to represent and model flows for many science
  and engineering applications. This paper introduces a novel neural network architecture
  for learning tangent vector fields that are intrinsically defined on manifold surfaces
  embedded in 3D. Previous approaches to learning vector fields on surfaces treat
  vectors as multi-dimensional scalar fields, using traditional scalar-valued architectures
  to process channels individually, thus fail to preserve fundamental intrinsic properties
  of the vector field. The core idea of this work is to introduce a trainable vector
  heat diffusion module to spatially propagate vector-valued feature data across the
  surface, which we incorporate into our proposed architecture that consists of vector-valued
  neurons. Our architecture is invariant to rigid motion of the input, isometric deformation,
  and choice of local tangent bases, and is robust to discretizations of the surface.
  We evaluate our Vector Heat Network on triangle meshes, and empirically validate
  its invariant properties. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on
  the useful industrial application of quadrilateral mesh generation.
