title: Adaptive Horizon Actor-Critic for Policy Learning in Contact-Rich Differentiable
  Simulation
openreview: 2FHWFG5ahw
abstract: Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (MFRL), leveraging the policy gradient
  theorem, has demonstrated considerable success in continuous control tasks. However,
  these approaches are plagued by high gradient variance due to zeroth-order gradient
  estimation, resulting in suboptimal policies. Conversely, First-Order Model-Based
  Reinforcement Learning (FO-MBRL) methods employing differentiable simulation provide
  gradients with reduced variance but are susceptible to sampling error in scenarios
  involving stiff dynamics, such as physical contact. This paper investigates the
  source of this error and introduces Adaptive Horizon Actor-Critic (AHAC), an FO-MBRL
  algorithm that reduces gradient error by adapting the model-based horizon to avoid
  stiff dynamics. Empirical findings reveal that AHAC outperforms MFRL baselines,
  attaining 40% more reward across a set of locomotion tasks and efficiently scaling
  to high-dimensional control environments with improved wall-clock-time efficiency.
