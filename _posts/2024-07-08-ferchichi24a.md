title: Active Ranking and Matchmaking, with Perfect Matchings
openreview: UZZaWUR0n4
abstract: 'We address the challenge of actively ranking a set of items/players with
  varying values/strengths. The comparison outcomes are random, with a greater noise
  the closer the values. A crucial requirement is that, at each iteration of the algorithm,
  all items must be compared once, i.e., an iteration is a perfect matching. Furthermore,
  we presume that comparing two players with closely matched strengths incurs no cost
  and, in contrast, a unit cost is associated with comparing players whose strength
  difference is more substantial. Our secondary objective is to determine an optimal
  matching between players based on this cost function: we propose and analyze an
  algorithm that draws on concepts from both AKS sorting networks and bandit theory.
  Our algorithm achieves both objectives with high probability, and the total cost
  is optimal (up to logarithmic terms).'
