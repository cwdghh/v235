title: 'CarbonNovo: Joint Design of Protein Structure and Sequence Using a Unified
  Energy-based Model'
openreview: FSxTEvuFa7
abstract: De novo protein design aims to create novel protein structures and sequences
  unseen in nature. Recent structure-oriented design methods typically employ a two-stage
  strategy, where structure design and sequence design modules are trained separately,
  and the backbone structures and sequences are generated sequentially in inference.
  While diffusion-based generative models like RFdiffusion show great promise in structure
  design, they face inherent limitations within the two-stage framework. First, the
  sequence design module risks overfitting, as the accuracy of the generated structures
  may not align with that of the crystal structures used for training. Second, the
  sequence design module lacks interaction with the structure design module to further
  optimize the generated structures. To address these challenges, we propose CarbonNovo,
  a unified energy-based model for jointly generating protein structure and sequence.
  Specifically, we leverage a score-based generative model and Markov Random Fields
  for describing the energy landscape of protein structure and sequence. In CarbonNovo,
  the structure and sequence design module communicates at each diffusion step, encouraging
  the generation of more coherent structure-sequence pairs. Moreover, the unified
  framework allows for incorporating the protein language models as evolutionary constraints
  for generated proteins. The rigorous evaluation demonstrates that CarbonNovo outperforms
  two-stage methods across various metrics, including designability, novelty, sequence
  plausibility, and Rosetta Energy.
