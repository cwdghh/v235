title: 'Density-Softmax: Efficient Test-time Model for Uncertainty Estimation and
  Robustness under Distribution Shifts'
openreview: lon750Kf7n
abstract: Sampling-based methods, e.g., Deep Ensembles and Bayesian Neural Nets have
  become promising approaches to improve the quality of uncertainty estimation and
  robust generalization. However, they suffer from a large model size and high latency
  at test time, which limits the scalability needed for low-resource devices and real-time
  applications. To resolve these computational issues, we propose Density-Softmax,
  a sampling-free deterministic framework via combining a density function built on
  a Lipschitz-constrained feature extractor with the softmax layer. Theoretically,
  we show that our model is the solution of minimax uncertainty risk and is distance-aware
  on feature space, thus reducing the over-confidence of the standard softmax under
  distribution shifts. Empirically, our method enjoys competitive results with state-of-the-art
  techniques in terms of uncertainty and robustness, while having a lower number of
  model parameters and a lower latency at test time.
