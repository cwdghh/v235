title: On the Feasibility of Single-Pass Full-Capacity Learning in Linear Threshold
  Neurons with Binary Input Vectors
openreview: l7vQQi0I2d
abstract: 'Known learning rules tend to fall near one of two extremes: single-pass
  associative learning with low complexity and capacity, and multi-pass iterative
  learning with high complexity and capacity. In this work we investigate the mathematical
  feasibility of learning rules that are both single-pass and achieve the theoretical
  upper bound on capacity. We consider a fairly broad family of learning rules we
  call “span rules,” which include known rules such as Hebbian learning, perceptron
  learning, and backpropagation as special cases. To our knowledge, previous work
  has not determined whether single-pass, full-capacity span rules exist, even in
  the most fundamental case of a linear threshold neuron with binary input vectors,
  which is the focus of this study. We derive a necessary condition for the existence
  of such learning rules, which takes the form of a linear program, and show that
  the linear program is infeasible. This establishes an impossibility result that
  span rules can not be both single-pass and full-capacity.'
