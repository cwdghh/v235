title: Conditional Common Entropy for Instrumental Variable Testing and Partial Identification
openreview: Wnni3cu39x
abstract: Instrumental variables (IVs) are widely used for estimating causal effects.
  There are two main challenges when using instrumental variables. First of all, using
  IV without additional assumptions such as linearity, the causal effect may still
  not be identifiable. Second, when selecting an IV, the validity of the selected
  IV is typically not testable since the causal graph is not identifiable from observational
  data. In this paper, we propose a method for bounding the causal effect with instrumental
  variables under weak confounding. In addition, we present a novel criterion to falsify
  the IV with side information about the confounder. We demonstrate the utility of
  the proposed method with simulated and real-world datasets.
