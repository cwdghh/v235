title: Learning in Deep Factor Graphs with Gaussian Belief Propagation
openreview: 6WYk5R86Wl
abstract: 'We propose an approach to do learning in Gaussian factor graphs. We treat
  all relevant quantities (inputs, outputs, parameters, activations) as random variables
  in a graphical model, and view training and prediction as inference problems with
  different observed nodes. Our experiments show that these problems can be efficiently
  solved with belief propagation (BP), whose updates are inherently local, presenting
  exciting opportunities for distributed and asynchronous training. Our approach can
  be scaled to deep networks and provides a natural means to do continual learning:
  use the BP-estimated posterior of the current task as a prior for the next. On a
  video denoising task we demonstrate the benefit of learnable parameters over a classical
  factor graph approach and we show encouraging performance of deep factor graphs
  for continual image classification.'
