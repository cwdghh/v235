title: Protein Conformation Generation via Force-Guided SE(3) Diffusion Models
openreview: aC1LSa4nXs
abstract: The conformational landscape of proteins is crucial to understanding their
  functionality in complex biological processes. Traditional physics-based computational
  methods, such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, suffer from rare event sampling
  and long equilibration time problems, hindering their applications in general protein
  systems. Recently, deep generative modeling techniques, especially diffusion models,
  have been employed to generate novel protein conformations. However, existing score-based
  diffusion methods cannot properly incorporate important physical prior knowledge
  to guide the generation process, causing large deviations in the sampled protein
  conformations from the equilibrium distribution. In this paper, to overcome these
  limitations, we propose a force-guided $\mathrm{SE}(3)$ diffusion model, ConfDiff,
  for protein conformation generation. By incorporating a force-guided network with
  a mixture of data-based score models, ConfDiff can generate protein conformations
  with rich diversity while preserving high fidelity. Experiments on a variety of
  protein conformation prediction tasks, including 12 fast-folding proteins and the
  Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (BPTI), demonstrate that our method surpasses
  the state-of-the-art method.
