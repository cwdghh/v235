title: Scalable Pre-training of Large Autoregressive Image Models
openreview: c92KDfEZTg
abstract: 'This paper introduces AIM, a collection of vision models pre-trained with
  an autoregressive objective. These models are inspired by their textual counterparts,
  i.e., Large Language Models (LLMs), and exhibit similar scaling properties. Specifically,
  we highlight two key findings: (1) the performance of the visual features scale
  with both the model capacity and the quantity of data, (2) the value of the objective
  function correlates with the performance of the model on downstream tasks. We illustrate
  the practical implication of these findings by pre-training a 7 billion parameter
  AIM on 2 billion images, that achieves 84.0% on ImageNet-1k with a frozen trunk.
  Interestingly, even at this scale, we observe no sign of saturation in performance,
  suggesting that AIM potentially represents a new frontier for training large-scale
  vision models. The pre-training of AIM is similar to the pre-training of LLMs, and
  does not require any image-specific strategy to stabilize the training at scale.'
