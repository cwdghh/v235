title: Parallel Affine Transformation Tuning of Markov Chain Monte Carlo
openreview: SAXp5dMYv7
abstract: The performance of Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers strongly depends on
  the properties of the target distribution such as its covariance structure, the
  location of its probability mass and its tail behavior. We explore the use of bijective
  affine transformations of the sample space to improve the properties of the target
  distribution and thereby the performance of samplers running in the transformed
  space. In particular, we propose a flexible and user-friendly scheme for adaptively
  learning the affine transformation during sampling. Moreover, the combination of
  our scheme with Gibbsian polar slice sampling is shown to produce samples of high
  quality at comparatively low computational cost in several settings based on real-world
  data.
