title: 'Monitoring AI-Modified Content at Scale: A Case Study on the Impact of ChatGPT
  on AI Conference Peer Reviews'
openreview: bX3J7ho18S
abstract: 'We present an approach for estimating the fraction of text in a large corpus
  which is likely to be substantially modified or produced by a large language model
  (LLM). Our maximum likelihood model leverages expert-written and AI-generated reference
  texts to accurately and efficiently examine real-world LLM-use at the corpus level.
  We apply this approach to a case study of scientific peer review in AI conferences
  that took place after the release of ChatGPT: <em>ICLR</em> 2024, <em>NeurIPS</em>
  2023, <em>CoRL</em> 2023 and <em>EMNLP</em> 2023. Our results suggest that between
  6.5% and 16.9% of text submitted as peer reviews to these conferences could have
  been substantially modified by LLMs, i.e. beyond spell-checking or minor writing
  updates. The circumstances in which generated text occurs offer insight into user
  behavior: the estimated fraction of LLM-generated text is higher in reviews which
  report lower confidence, were submitted close to the deadline, and from reviewers
  who are less likely to respond to author rebuttals. We also observe corpus-level
  trends in generated text which may be too subtle to detect at the individual level,
  and discuss the implications of such trends on peer review. We call for future interdisciplinary
  work to examine how LLM use is changing our information and knowledge practices.'
