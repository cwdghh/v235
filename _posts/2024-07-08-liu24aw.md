title: 'Deep Functional Factor Models: Forecasting High-Dimensional Functional Time
  Series via Bayesian Nonparametric Factorization'
openreview: dHXKCyaIkp
abstract: This paper introduces the Deep Functional Factor Model (DF2M), a Bayesian
  nonparametric model designed for analysis of high-dimensional functional time series.
  DF2M is built upon the Indian Buffet Process and the multi-task Gaussian Process,
  incorporating a deep kernel function that captures non-Markovian and nonlinear temporal
  dynamics. Unlike many black-box deep learning models, DF2M offers an explainable
  approach to utilizing neural networks by constructing a factor model and integrating
  deep neural networks within the kernel function. Additionally, we develop a computationally
  efficient variational inference algorithm to infer DF2M. Empirical results from
  four real-world datasets demonstrate that DF2M provides better explainability and
  superior predictive accuracy compared to conventional deep learning models for high-dimensional
  functional time series.
