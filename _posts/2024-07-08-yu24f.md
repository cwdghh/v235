title: Learning Latent Structures in Network Games via Data-Dependent Gated-Prior
  Graph Variational Autoencoders
openreview: kKWjZoaRLv
abstract: In network games, individuals interact strategically within network environments
  to maximize their utilities. However, obtaining network structures is challenging.
  In this work, we propose an unsupervised learning model, called data-dependent gated-prior
  graph variational autoencoder (GPGVAE), that infers the underlying latent interaction
  type (strategic complement vs. substitute) among individuals and the latent network
  structure based on their observed actions. Specially, we propose a spectral graph
  neural network (GNN) based encoder to predict the interaction type and a data-dependent
  gated prior that models network structures conditioned on the interaction type.
  We further propose a Transformer based mixture of Bernoulli encoder of network structures
  and a GNN based decoder of game actions. We systematically study the Monte Carlo
  gradient estimation methods and effectively train our model in a stage-wise fashion.
  Extensive experiments across various synthetic and real-world network games demonstrate
  that our model achieves state-of-the-art performances in inferring network structures
  and well captures interaction types.
