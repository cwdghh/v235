title: Refining Minimax Regret for Unsupervised Environment Design
openreview: LRnXPxDksA
abstract: In unsupervised environment design, reinforcement learning agents are trained
  on environment configurations (levels) generated by an adversary that maximises
  some objective. Regret is a commonly used objective that theoretically results in
  a minimax regret (MMR) policy with desirable robustness guarantees; in particular,
  the agentâ€™s maximum regret is bounded. However, once the agent reaches this regret
  bound on all levels, the adversary will only sample levels where regret cannot be
  further reduced. Although there may be possible performance improvements to be made
  outside of these regret-maximising levels, learning stagnates. In this work, we
  introduce <em>Bayesian level-perfect MMR</em> (BLP), a refinement of the minimax
  regret objective that overcomes this limitation. We formally show that solving for
  this objective results in a subset of MMR policies, and that BLP policies act consistently
  with a Perfect Bayesian policy over all levels. We further introduce an algorithm,
  <em>ReMiDi</em>, that results in a BLP policy at convergence. We empirically demonstrate
  that training on levels from a minimax regret adversary causes learning to prematurely
  stagnate, but that ReMiDi continues learning.
