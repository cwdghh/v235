title: Boosting Reinforcement Learning with Strongly Delayed Feedback Through Auxiliary
  Short Delays
openreview: 0IDaPnY5d5
abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging in the common case of delays
  between events and their sensory perceptions. State-of-the-art (SOTA) state augmentation
  techniques either suffer from state space explosion or performance degeneration
  in stochastic environments. To address these challenges, we present a novel <em>Auxiliary-Delayed
  Reinforcement Learning (AD-RL)</em> method that leverages auxiliary tasks involving
  short delays to accelerate RL with long delays, without compromising performance
  in stochastic environments. Specifically, AD-RL learns a value function for short
  delays and uses bootstrapping and policy improvement techniques to adjust it for
  long delays. We theoretically show that this can greatly reduce the sample complexity.
  On deterministic and stochastic benchmarks, our method significantly outperforms
  the SOTAs in both sample efficiency and policy performance. Code is available at
