title: 'xT: Nested Tokenization for Larger Context in Large Images'
openreview: wDDprThYeT
abstract: 'Modern computer vision pipelines handle large images in one of two sub-optimal
  ways: down-sampling or cropping. These two methods incur significant losses in the
  amount of information and context present in an image. There are many downstream
  applications in which global context matters as much as high frequency details,
  such as in real-world satellite imagery; in such cases researchers have to make
  the uncomfortable choice of which information to discard. We introduce <em>xT</em>,
  a simple framework for vision transformers which effectively aggregates global context
  with local details and can model large images end-to-end on contemporary GPUs. We
  select a set of benchmark datasets across classic vision tasks which accurately
  reflect a vision model’s ability to understand truly large images and incorporate
  fine details over large scales and assess our method’s improvement on them. <em>xT</em>
  is a streaming, two-stage architecture that adapts existing vision backbones and
  long sequence language models to effectively model large images without quadratic
  memory growth. We are able to increase accuracy by up to 8.6% on challenging classification
  tasks and F1 score by 11.6 on context-dependent segmentation on images as large
  as 29,000 x 29,000 pixels.'
