title: 'How Deep Networks Learn Sparse and Hierarchical Data: the Sparse Random Hierarchy
  Model'
openreview: CtEWswTjUd
abstract: Understanding what makes high-dimensional data learnable is a fundamental
  question in machine learning. On the one hand, it is believed that the success of
  deep learning lies in its ability to build a hierarchy of representations that become
  increasingly more abstract with depth, going from simple features like edges to
  more complex concepts. On the other hand, learning to be insensitive to invariances
  of the task, such as smooth transformations for image datasets, has been argued
  to be important for deep networks and it strongly correlates with their performance.
  In this work, we aim to explain this correlation and unify these two viewpoints.
  We show that by introducing sparsity to generative hierarchical models of data,
  the task acquires insensitivity to spatial transformations that are discrete versions
  of smooth transformations. In particular, we introduce the Sparse Random Hierarchy
  Model (SRHM), where we observe and rationalize that a hierarchical representation
  mirroring the hierarchical model is learnt precisely when such insensitivity is
  learnt, thereby explaining the strong correlation between the latter and performance.
  Moreover, we quantify how the sample complexity of CNNs learning the SRHM depends
  on both the sparsity and hierarchical structure of the task.
