title: Stability and Generalization of Stochastic Compositional Gradient Descent Algorithms
openreview: XWkRyIjYDp
abstract: Many machine learning tasks can be formulated as a stochastic compositional
  optimization (SCO) problem such as reinforcement learning, AUC maximization and
  meta-learning, where the objective function involves a nested composition associated
  with an expectation. Although many studies have been devoted to studying the convergence
  behavior of SCO algorithms, there is little work on understanding their generalization,
  that is, how these learning algorithms built from training data would behave on
  future test examples. In this paper, we provide the stability and generalization
  analysis of stochastic compositional gradient descent algorithms in the framework
  of statistical learning theory. Firstly, we introduce a stability concept called
  <em>compositional uniform stability</em> and establish its quantitative relation
  with generalization for SCO problems. Then, we establish the compositional uniform
  stability results for two notable stochastic compositional gradient descent algorithms,
  namely SCGD and SCSC. Finally, we derive <em>dimension-independent</em> excess risk
  bounds for SCGD and SCSC by balancing stability results and optimization errors.
  To the best of our knowledge, these are the first-ever known results on stability
  and generalization analysis of stochastic compositional gradient descent algorithms.
