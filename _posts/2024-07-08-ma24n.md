title: Fast Peer Adaptation with Context-aware Exploration
openreview: CBcNl5Eo32
abstract: Fast adapting to unknown peers (partners or opponents) with different strategies
  is a key challenge in multi-agent games. To do so, it is crucial for the agent to
  probe and identify the peerâ€™s strategy efficiently, as this is the prerequisite
  for carrying out the best response in adaptation. However, exploring the strategies
  of unknown peers is difficult, especially when the games are partially observable
  and have a long horizon. In this paper, we propose a peer identification reward,
  which rewards the learning agent based on how well it can identify the behavior
  pattern of the peer over the historical context, such as the observation over multiple
  episodes. This reward motivates the agent to learn a context-aware policy for effective
  exploration and fast adaptation, i.e., to actively seek and collect informative
  feedback from peers when uncertain about their policies and to exploit the context
  to perform the best response when confident. We evaluate our method on diverse testbeds
  that involve competitive (Kuhn Poker), cooperative (PO-Overcooked), or mixed (Predator-Prey-W)
  games with peer agents. We demonstrate that our method induces more active exploration
  behavior, achieving faster adaptation and better outcomes than existing methods.
