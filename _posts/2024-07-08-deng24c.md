title: Variational Schrödinger Diffusion Models
openreview: kRv0WPJd00
abstract: Schrödinger bridge (SB) has emerged as the go-to method for optimizing transportation
  plans in diffusion models. However, SB requires estimating the intractable forward
  score functions, inevitably resulting in the (costly) implicit training loss based
  on simulated trajectories. To improve the scalability while preserving efficient
  transportation plans, we leverage variational inference to linearize the forward
  score functions (variational scores) of SB and restore <em>simulation-free</em>
  properties in training backward scores. We propose the variational Schrödinger diffusion
  model (VSDM), where the forward process is a multivariate diffusion and the variational
  scores are adaptively optimized for efficient transport. Theoretically, we use stochastic
  approximation to prove the convergence of the variational scores and show the convergence
  of the adaptively generated samples based on the optimal variational scores. Empirically,
  we test the algorithm in simulated examples and observe that VSDM is efficient in
  generations of anisotropic shapes and yields straighter sample trajectories compared
  to the single-variate diffusion. We also verify the scalability of the algorithm
  in real-world data and achieve competitive unconditional generation performance
  in CIFAR10 and conditional generation in time series modeling. Notably, VSDM no
  longer depends on warm-up initializations required by SB.
