title: 'EquiPocket: an E(3)-Equivariant Geometric Graph Neural Network for Ligand
  Binding Site Prediction'
openreview: 1vGN3CSxVs
abstract: 'Predicting the binding sites of target proteins plays a fundamental role
  in drug discovery. Most existing deep-learning methods consider a protein as a 3D
  image by spatially clustering its atoms into voxels and then feed the voxelized
  protein into a 3D CNN for prediction. However, the CNN-based methods encounter several
  critical issues: 1) defective in representing irregular protein structures; 2) sensitive
  to rotations; 3) insufficient to characterize the protein surface; 4) unaware of
  protein size shift. To address the above issues, this work proposes EquiPocket,
  an E(3)-equivariant Graph Neural Network (GNN) for binding site prediction, which
  comprises three modules: the first one to extract local geometric information for
  each surface atom, the second one to model both the chemical and spatial structure
  of protein and the last one to capture the geometry of the surface via equivariant
  message passing over the surface atoms. We further propose a dense attention output
  layer to alleviate the effect incurred by variable protein size. Extensive experiments
  on several representative benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework
  to the state-of-the-art methods.'
