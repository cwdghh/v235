title: Unlocking the Power of Spatial and Temporal Information in Medical Multimodal
  Pre-training
openreview: 87ZrVHDqmR
abstract: Medical vision-language pre-training methods mainly leverage the correspondence
  between paired medical images and radiological reports. Although multi-view spatial
  images and temporal sequences of image-report pairs are available in off-the-shelf
  multi-modal medical datasets, most existing methods have not thoroughly tapped into
  such extensive supervision signals. In this paper, we introduce the Med-ST framework
  for fine-grained spatial and temporal modeling to exploit information from multiple
  spatial views of chest radiographs and temporal historical records. For spatial
  modeling, Med-ST employs the <em>Mixture of View Expert (MoVE)</em> architecture
  to integrate different visual features from both frontal and lateral views. To achieve
  a more comprehensive alignment, Med-ST not only establishes the global alignment
  between whole images and texts but also introduces modality-weighted local alignment
  between text tokens and spatial regions of images. For temporal modeling, we propose
  a novel cross-modal bidirectional cycle consistency objective by forward mapping
  classification (FMC) and reverse mapping regression (RMR). By perceiving temporal
  information from simple to complex, Med-ST can learn temporal semantics. Experimental
  results across four distinct tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of Med-ST, especially
  in temporal classification tasks. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/SVT-Yang/MedST.
