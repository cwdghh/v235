title: Graph Out-of-Distribution Detection Goes Neighborhood Shaping
openreview: pmcusTywXO
abstract: Despite the rich line of research works on out-of-distribution (OOD) detection
  on images, the literature on OOD detection for interdependent data, e.g., graphs,
  is still relatively limited. To fill this gap, we introduce TopoOOD as a principled
  approach that accommodates graph topology and neighborhood context for detecting
  OOD node instances on graphs. Meanwhile, we enrich the experiment settings by splitting
  in-distribution (ID) and OOD data based on distinct topological distributions, which
  presents new benchmarks for a more comprehensive analysis of graph-based OOD detection.
  The latter is designed to thoroughly assess the performance of these discriminators
  under distribution shifts involving structural information, providing a rigorous
  evaluation of methods in the emerging area of OOD detection on graphs. Our experimental
  results show the competitiveness of the proposed model across multiple datasets,
  as evidenced by up to a 15% increase in the AUROC and a 50% decrease in the FPR
  compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
