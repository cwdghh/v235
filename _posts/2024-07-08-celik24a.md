title: Acquiring Diverse Skills using Curriculum Reinforcement Learning with Mixture
  of Experts
openreview: 9ZkUFSwlUH
abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful approach for acquiring a good-performing
  policy. However, learning diverse skills is challenging in RL due to the commonly
  used Gaussian policy parameterization. We propose Diverse Skill Learning (Di-SkilL),
  an RL method for learning diverse skills using Mixture of Experts, where each expert
  formalizes a skill as a contextual motion primitive. Di-SkilL optimizes each expert
  and its associate context distribution to a maximum entropy objective that incentivizes
  learning diverse skills in similar contexts. The per-expert context distribution
  enables automatic curricula learning, allowing each expert to focus on its best-performing
  sub-region of the context space. To overcome hard discontinuities and multi-modalities
  without any prior knowledge of the environmentâ€™s unknown context probability space,
  we leverage energy-based models to represent the per-expert context distributions
  and demonstrate how we can efficiently train them using the standard policy gradient
  objective. We show on challenging robot simulation tasks that Di-SkilL can learn
  diverse and performant skills.
