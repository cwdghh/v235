title: A Computational Framework for Solving Wasserstein Lagrangian Flows
openreview: wwItuHdus6
abstract: The dynamical formulation of the optimal transport can be extended through
  various choices of the underlying geometry (<em>kinetic energy</em>), and the regularization
  of density paths (<em>potential energy</em>). These combinations yield different
  variational problems (<em>Lagrangians</em>), encompassing many variations of the
  optimal transport problem such as the Schr√∂dinger bridge, unbalanced optimal transport,
  and optimal transport with physical constraints, among others. In general, the optimal
  density path is unknown, and solving these variational problems can be computationally
  challenging. We propose a novel deep learning based framework approaching all of
  these problems from a unified perspective. Leveraging the dual formulation of the
  Lagrangians, our method does not require simulating or backpropagating through the
  trajectories of the learned dynamics, and does not need access to optimal couplings.
  We showcase the versatility of the proposed framework by outperforming previous
  approaches for the single-cell trajectory inference, where incorporating prior knowledge
  into the dynamics is crucial for correct predictions.
