title: 'Learning from Memory: Non-Parametric Memory Augmented Self-Supervised Learning
  of Visual Features'
openreview: Ed4KgHoKNe
abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to improving the training stability
  of self-supervised learning (SSL) methods by leveraging a non-parametric memory
  of seen concepts. The proposed method involves augmenting a neural network with
  a memory component to stochastically compare current image views with previously
  encountered concepts. Additionally, we introduce stochastic memory blocks to regularize
  training and enforce consistency between image views. We extensively benchmark our
  method on many vision tasks, such as linear probing, transfer learning, few-shot
  classification, and image retrieval on many datasets. The experimental results consolidate
  the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving stable SSL training without
  additional regularizers while learning highly transferable representations and requiring
  less computing time and resources.
