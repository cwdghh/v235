title: Statistical Properties of Robust Satisficing
openreview: iqAyWVLUEO
abstract: The Robust Satisficing (RS) model is an emerging approach to robust optimization,
  offering streamlined procedures and robust generalization across various applications.
  However, the statistical theory of RS remains unexplored in the literature. This
  paper fills in the gap by comprehensively analyzing the theoretical properties of
  the RS model. Notably, the RS structure offers a more straightforward path to deriving
  statistical guarantees compared to the seminal Distributionally Robust Optimization
  (DRO), resulting in a richer set of results. In particular, we establish two-sided
  confidence intervals for the optimal loss without the need to solve a minimax optimization
  problem explicitly. We further provide finite-sample generalization error bounds
  for the RS optimizer. Importantly, our results extend to scenarios involving distribution
  shifts, where discrepancies exist between the sampling and target distributions.
  Our numerical experiments show that the RS model consistently outperforms the baseline
  empirical risk minimization in small-sample regimes and under distribution shifts.
  Furthermore, compared to the DRO model, the RS model exhibits lower sensitivity
  to hyperparameter tuning, highlighting its practicability for robustness considerations.
