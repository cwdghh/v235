title: 'Moreau Envelope for Nonconvex Bi-Level Optimization: A Single-Loop and Hessian-Free
  Solution Strategy'
openreview: rZD9hV0Bc4
abstract: This work focuses on addressing two major challenges in the context of large-scale
  nonconvex Bi-Level Optimization (BLO) problems, which are increasingly applied in
  machine learning due to their ability to model nested structures. These challenges
  involve ensuring computational efficiency and providing theoretical guarantees.
  While recent advances in scalable BLO algorithms have primarily relied on lower-level
  convexity simplification, our work specifically tackles large-scale BLO problems
  involving nonconvexity in both the upper and lower levels. We simultaneously address
  computational and theoretical challenges by introducing an innovative single-loop
  gradient-based algorithm, utilizing the Moreau envelope-based reformulation, and
  providing non-asymptotic convergence analysis for general nonconvex BLO problems.
  Notably, our algorithm relies solely on first-order gradient information, enhancing
  its practicality and efficiency, especially for large-scale BLO learning tasks.
  We validate our approachâ€™s effectiveness through experiments on various synthetic
  problems, two typical hyper-parameter learning tasks, and a real-world neural architecture
  search application, collectively demonstrating its superior performance.
