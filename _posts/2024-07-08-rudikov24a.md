title: 'Neural operators meet conjugate gradients: The FCG-NO method for efficient
  PDE solving'
openreview: J0ty1o7nCj
abstract: Deep learning solvers for partial differential equations typically have
  limited accuracy. We propose to overcome this problem by using them as preconditioners.
  More specifically, we apply discretization-invariant neural operators to learn preconditioners
  for the flexible conjugate gradient method (FCG). Architecture paired with novel
  loss function and training scheme allows for learning efficient preconditioners
  that can be used across different resolutions. On the theoretical side, FCG theory
  allows us to safely use nonlinear preconditioners that can be applied in $O(N)$
  operations without constraining the form of the preconditioners matrix. To justify
  learning scheme components (the loss function and the way training data is collected)
  we perform several ablation studies. Numerical results indicate that our approach
  favorably compares with classical preconditioners and allows to reuse of preconditioners
  learned for lower resolution to the higher resolution data.
