title: 'Weisfeiler-Leman at the margin: When more expressivity matters'
openreview: HTNgNt8CTJ
abstract: The Weisfeiler–Leman algorithm (1-WL) is a well-studied heuristic for the
  graph isomorphism problem. Recently, the algorithm has played a prominent role in
  understanding the expressive power of message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs)
  and being effective as a graph kernel. Despite its success, the 1-WL faces challenges
  in distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs, leading to the development of more expressive
  MPNN and kernel architectures. However, the relationship between enhanced expressivity
  and improved generalization performance remains unclear. Here, we show that an architecture’s
  expressivity offers limited insights into its generalization performance when viewed
  through graph isomorphism. Moreover, we focus on augmenting 1-WL and MPNNs with
  subgraph information and employ classical margin theory to investigate the conditions
  under which an architecture’s increased expressivity aligns with improved generalization
  performance. In addition, we introduce variations of expressive 1-WL-based kernel
  and MPNN architectures with provable generalization properties. Our empirical study
  confirms the validity of our theoretical findings.
