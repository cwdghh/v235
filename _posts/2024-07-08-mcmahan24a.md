title: 'Roping in Uncertainty: Robustness and Regularization in Markov Games'
openreview: y6y2HauOpR
abstract: We study robust Markov games (RMG) with $s$-rectangular uncertainty. We
  show a general equivalence between computing a robust Nash equilibrium (RNE) of
  a $s$-rectangular RMG and computing a Nash equilibrium (NE) of an appropriately
  constructed regularized MG. The equivalence result yields a planning algorithm for
  solving $s$-rectangular RMGs, as well as provable robustness guarantees for policies
  computed using regularized methods. However, we show that even for just reward-uncertain
  two-player zero-sum matrix games, computing an RNE is PPAD-hard. Consequently, we
  derive a special uncertainty structure called efficient player-decomposability and
  show that RNE for two-player zero-sum RMG in this class can be provably solved in
  polynomial time. This class includes commonly used uncertainty sets such as $L_1$
  and $L_\infty$ ball uncertainty sets.
