title: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition as Label-balanced Multi-label Learning
openreview: CD2xl1L5es
abstract: 'Rooting in the scarcity of most attributes, realistic pedestrian attribute
  datasets exhibit unduly skewed data distribution, from which two types of model
  failures are delivered: (1) label imbalance: model predictions lean greatly towards
  the side of majority labels; (2) semantics imbalance: model is easily overfitted
  on the under-represented attributes due to their insufficient semantic diversity.
  To render perfect label balancing, we propose a novel framework that successfully
  decouples label-balanced data re-sampling from the curse of attributes co-occurrence,
  i.e., we equalize the sampling prior of an attribute while not biasing that of the
  co-occurred others. To diversify the attributes semantics and mitigate the feature
  noise, we propose a Bayesian feature augmentation method to introduce true in-distribution
  novelty. Handling both imbalances jointly, our work achieves best accuracy on various
  popular benchmarks, and importantly, with minimal computational budget.'
