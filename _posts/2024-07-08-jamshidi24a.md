title: On the sample complexity of conditional independence testing with Von Mises
  estimator with application to causal discovery
openreview: oSOZ31ISBV
abstract: Motivated by conditional independence testing, an essential step in constraint-based
  causal discovery algorithms, we study the nonparametric Von Mises estimator for
  the entropy of multivariate distributions built on a kernel density estimator. We
  establish an exponential concentration inequality for this estimator. We design
  a test for conditional independence (CI) based on our estimator, called VM-CI, which
  achieves optimal parametric rates under smoothness assumptions. Leveraging the exponential
  concentration, we prove a tight upper bound for the overall error of VM-CI. This,
  in turn, allows us to characterize the sample complexity of any constraint-based
  causal discovery algorithm that uses VM-CI for CI tests. To the best of our knowledge,
  this is the first sample complexity guarantee for causal discovery for non-linear
  models and non-Gaussian continuous variables. Furthermore, we empirically show that
  VM-CI outperforms other popular CI tests in terms of either time, sample complexity,
  or both. This enhancement significantly improves the performance in structure learning
  as well.
