title: 'Enforcing Constraints in RNA Secondary Structure Predictions: A Post-Processing
  Framework Based on the Assignment Problem'
openreview: XGGcnKelda
abstract: RNA properties, such as function and stability, are intricately tied to
  their two-dimensional conformations. This has spurred the development of computational
  models for predicting the RNA secondary structures, leveraging dynamic programming
  or machine learning (ML) techniques. These structures are governed by specific rules;
  for example, only Watson-Crick and Wobble pairs are allowed, and sequences must
  not form sharp bends. Recent efforts introduced a systematic approach to post-process
  the predictions made by ML algorithms, aiming to modify them to respect the constraints.
  However, we still observe instances violating the requirements, significantly reducing
  biological relevance. To address this challenge, we present a novel post-processing
  framework for ML-based predictions on RNA secondary structures, inspired by the
  assignment problem in integer linear programming. Our algorithm offers a theoretical
  guarantee, ensuring that the resulting predictions adhere to the fundamental constraints
  of RNAs. Empirical evidence supports the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating
  improved predictive performance with no constraint violation, while requiring less
  running time.
