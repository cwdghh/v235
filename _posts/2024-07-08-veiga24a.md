title: Stochastic Gradient Flow Dynamics of Test Risk and its Exact Solution for Weak
  Features
openreview: gPBMkJG7bt
abstract: We investigate the test risk of a continuous time stochastic gradient flow
  dynamics in learning theory. Using a path integral formulation we provide, in the
  regime of small learning rate, a general formula for computing the difference between
  test risk curves of pure gradient and stochastic gradient flows. We apply the general
  theory to a simple model of weak features, which displays the double descent phenomenon,
  and explicitly compute the corrections brought about by the added stochastic term
  in the dynamics, as a function of time and model parameters. The analytical results
  are compared to simulations of discrete time stochastic gradient descent and show
  good agreement.
