title: Causal Effect Identification in LiNGAM Models with Latent Confounders
openreview: C1iNBLIClt
abstract: 'We study the generic identifiability of causal effects in linear non-Gaussian
  acyclic models (LiNGAM) with latent variables. We consider the problem in two main
  settings: When the causal graph is known a priori, and when it is unknown. In both
  settings, we provide a complete graphical characterization of the identifiable direct
  or total causal effects among observed variables. Moreover, we propose efficient
  algorithms to certify the graphical conditions. Finally, we propose an adaptation
  of the reconstruction independent component analysis (RICA) algorithm that estimates
  the causal effects from the observational data given the causal graph. Experimental
  results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in estimating the causal effects.'
