title: 'Sharp Rates in Dependent Learning Theory: Avoiding Sample Size Deflation for
  the Square Loss'
openreview: DHtF8Y6PqS
abstract: 'In this work, we study statistical learning with dependent data and square
  loss in a hypothesis class with tail decay in Orlicz space: $\mathscr{F}\subset
  L_{\Psi_p}$. Our inquiry is motivated by the search for a sharp noise interaction
  term, or variance proxy, in learning with dependent (e.g. $\beta$-mixing) data.
  Typical non-asymptotic results exhibit variance proxies that are deflated <em>multiplicatively</em>
  in the mixing time of the underlying covariates process. We show that whenever the
  topologies of $L^2$ and $\Psi_p$ are comparable on our hypothesis class $\mathscr{F}$,
  the empirical risk minimizer achieves a rate that only depends on the complexity
  of the class and second order statistics in its leading term. We refer to this as
  a <em>near mixing-free rate</em>, since direct dependence on mixing is relegated
  to an additive higher order term. Our approach, reliant on mixed tail generic chaining,
  allows us to obtain sharp, instance-optimal rates. Examples that satisfy our framework
  include for instance sub-Gaussian linear regression and bounded smoothness classes.'
