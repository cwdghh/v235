title: Rethinking Adversarial Robustness in the Context of the Right to be Forgotten
openreview: tmUorldOWN
abstract: The past few years have seen an intense research interest in the practical
  needs of the "right to be forgotten", which has motivated researchers to develop
  machine unlearning methods to unlearn a fraction of training data and its lineage.
  While existing machine unlearning methods prioritize the protection of individuals’
  private data, they overlook investigating the unlearned models’ susceptibility to
  adversarial attacks and security breaches. In this work, we uncover a novel security
  vulnerability of machine unlearning based on the insight that adversarial vulnerabilities
  can be bolstered, especially for adversarially robust models. To exploit this observed
  vulnerability, we propose a novel attack called Adversarial Unlearning Attack (AdvUA),
  which aims to generate a small fraction of malicious unlearning requests during
  the unlearning process. AdvUA causes a significant reduction of adversarial robustness
  in the unlearned model compared to the original model, providing an entirely new
  capability for adversaries that is infeasible in conventional machine learning pipelines.
  Notably, we also show that AdvUA can effectively enhance model stealing attacks
  by extracting additional decision boundary information, further emphasizing the
  breadth and significance of our research. We also conduct both theoretical analysis
  and computational complexity of AdvUA. Extensive numerical studies are performed
  to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack.
