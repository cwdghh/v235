title: 'LQER: Low-Rank Quantization Error Reconstruction for LLMs'
openreview: dh8k41g775
abstract: Post-training quantization of Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging.
  In this work, we introduce <b>L</b>ow-rank <b>Q</b>uantization <b>E</b>rror <b>R</b>eduction
  (LQER), which combines quantization and low-rank approximation to recover the model
  capability. LQER leverages an activation-induced scale matrix to drive the singular
  value distribution of quantization error towards a desirable distribution, which
  enables nearly-lossless W4A8 quantization on various LLMs and downstream tasks without
  the need for knowledge distillation, grid search, or gradient-based iterative optimization.
  Unlike existing methods, the computation pattern of LQER eliminates the need for
  specialized Scatter and Gather processes to collect high-precision weights from
  irregular memory locations. Our W4A8 LLMs achieve near-lossless performance on six
  popular downstream tasks, while using $1.36 \times$ fewer hardware resources than
  the leading state-of-the-art method. We will open-source our framework at https://github.com/ChengZhang-98/lqer
