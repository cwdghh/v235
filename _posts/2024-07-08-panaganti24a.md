title: Model-Free Robust $φ$-Divergence Reinforcement Learning Using Both Offline
  and Online Data
openreview: Yug1IEkvcb
abstract: The robust $\phi$-regularized Markov Decision Process (RRMDP) framework
  focuses on designing control policies that are robust against parameter uncertainties
  due to mismatches between the simulator (nominal) model and real-world settings.
  This work makes <em>two</em> important contributions. First, we propose a <em>model-free</em>
  algorithm called <em>Robust $\phi$-regularized fitted Q-iteration</em> for learning
  an $\epsilon$-optimal robust policy that uses only the historical data collected
  by rolling out a behavior policy (with <em>robust exploratory</em> requirement)
  on the nominal model. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the <em>first</em>
  unified analysis for a class of $\phi$-divergences achieving robust optimal policies
  in high-dimensional systems of arbitrary large state space with general function
  approximation. Second, we introduce the <em>hybrid robust $\phi$-regularized reinforcement
  learning</em> framework to learn an optimal robust policy using both historical
  data and online sampling. Towards this framework, we propose a model-free algorithm
  called <em>Hybrid robust Total-variation-regularized Q-iteration</em>. To the best
  of our knowledge, we provide the <em>first</em> improved out-of-data-distribution
  assumption in large-scale problems of arbitrary large state space with general function
  approximation under the hybrid robust $\phi$-regularized reinforcement learning
  framework.
