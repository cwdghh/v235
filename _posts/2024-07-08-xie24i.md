title: Counterfactual Reasoning for Multi-Label Image Classification via Patching-Based
  Training
openreview: lQIN9ZyMLz
abstract: The key to multi-label image classification (MLC) is to improve model performance
  by leveraging label correlations. Unfortunately, it has been shown that overemphasizing
  co-occurrence relationships can cause the overfitting issue of the model, ultimately
  leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we provide a causal inference
  framework to show that the correlative features caused by the target object and
  its co-occurring objects can be regarded as a mediator, which has both positive
  and negative impacts on model predictions. On the positive side, the mediator enhances
  the recognition performance of the model by capturing co-occurrence relationships;
  on the negative side, it has the harmful causal effect that causes the model to
  make an incorrect prediction for the target object, even when only co-occurring
  objects are present in an image. To address this problem, we propose a counterfactual
  reasoning method to measure the total direct effect, achieved by enhancing the direct
  effect caused only by the target object. Due to the unknown location of the target
  object, we propose patching-based training and inference to accomplish this goal,
  which divides an image into multiple patches and identifies the pivot patch that
  contains the target object. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets
  with diverse configurations validate that the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art
  performance.
