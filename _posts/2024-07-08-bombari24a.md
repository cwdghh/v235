title: 'How Spurious Features are Memorized: Precise Analysis for Random and NTK Features'
openreview: o6N1Bqay0k
abstract: 'Deep learning models are known to overfit and memorize spurious features
  in the training dataset. While numerous empirical studies have aimed at understanding
  this phenomenon, a rigorous theoretical framework to quantify it is still missing.
  In this paper, we consider spurious features that are uncorrelated with the learning
  task, and we provide a precise characterization of how they are memorized via two
  separate terms: <em>(i)</em> the <em>stability</em> of the model with respect to
  individual training samples, and <em>(ii)</em> the <em>feature alignment</em> between
  the spurious pattern and the full sample. While the first term is well established
  in learning theory and it is connected to the generalization error in classical
  work, the second one is, to the best of our knowledge, novel. Our key technical
  result gives a precise characterization of the feature alignment for the two prototypical
  settings of random features (RF) and neural tangent kernel (NTK) regression. We
  prove that the memorization of spurious features weakens as the generalization capability
  increases and, through the analysis of the feature alignment, we unveil the role
  of the model and of its activation function. Numerical experiments show the predictive
  power of our theory on standard datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10).'
