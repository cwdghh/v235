title: An Efficient Self-Learning Framework For Interactive Spoken Dialog Systems
openreview: 4uTJfGYA2t
abstract: Dialog systems, such as voice assistants, are expected to engage with users
  in complex, evolving conversations. Unfortunately, traditional automatic speech
  recognition (ASR) systems deployed in such applications are usually trained to recognize
  each turn independently and lack the ability to adapt to the conversational context
  or incorporate user feedback. In this work, we introduce a general framework for
  ASR in dialog systems that can go beyond learning from single-turn utterances and
  learn over time how to adapt to both explicit supervision and implicit user feedback
  present in multi-turn conversations. We accomplish that by leveraging advances in
  student-teacher learning and context-aware dialog processing, and designing contrastive
  self-supervision approaches with Ohm, a new online hard-negative mining approach.
  We show that leveraging our new framework compared to traditional training leads
  to relative WER reductions of close to 10% in real-world dialog systems, and up
  to 26% on public synthetic data.
