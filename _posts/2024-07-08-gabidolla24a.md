title: 'Beyond the ROC Curve: Classification Trees Using Cost-Optimal Curves, with
  Application to Imbalanced Datasets'
openreview: mXLcbRBA8v
abstract: Important applications such as fraud or spam detection or churn prediction
  involve binary classification problems where the datasets are imbalanced and the
  cost of false positives greatly differs from the cost of false negatives. We focus
  on classification trees, in particular oblique trees, which subsume both the traditional
  axis-aligned trees and logistic regression, but are more accurate than both while
  providing interpretable models. Rather than using ROC curves, we advocate a loss
  based on minimizing the false negatives subject to a maximum false positive rate,
  which we prove to be equivalent to minimizing a weighted 0/1 loss. This yields a
  curve of classifiers that provably dominates the ROC curve, but is hard to optimize
  due to the 0/1 loss. We give the first algorithm that can iteratively update the
  tree parameters globally so that the weighted 0/1 loss decreases monotonically.
  Experiments on various datasets with class imbalance or class costs show this indeed
  dominates ROC-based classifiers and significantly improves over previous approaches
  to learn trees based on weighted purity criteria or over- or undersampling.
