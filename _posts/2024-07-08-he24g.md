title: Quantum Algorithm for Online Exp-concave Optimization
openreview: JApt4Ty89Y
abstract: We explore whether quantum advantages can be found for the zeroth-order
  feedback online exp-concave optimization problem, which is also known as bandit
  exp-concave optimization with multi-point feedback. We present quantum online quasi-Newton
  methods to tackle the problem and show that there exists quantum advantages for
  such problems. Our method approximates the Hessian by quantum estimated inexact
  gradient and can achieve $O(n\log T)$ regret with $O(1)$ queries at each round,
  where $n$ is the dimension of the decision set and $T$ is the total decision rounds.
  Such regret improves the optimal classical algorithm by a factor of $T^{2/3}$.
