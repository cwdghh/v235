title: Risk-Sensitive Policy Optimization via Predictive CVaR Policy Gradient
openreview: 24zMewdzyJ
abstract: This paper addresses a policy optimization task with the conditional value-at-risk
  (CVaR) objective. We introduce the <em>predictive CVaR policy gradient</em>, a novel
  approach that seamlessly integrates risk-neutral policy gradient algorithms with
  minimal modifications. Our method incorporates a reweighting strategy in gradient
  calculation â€“ individual cost terms are reweighted in proportion to their <em>predicted</em>
  contribution to the objective. These weights can be easily estimated through a separate
  learning procedure. We provide theoretical and empirical analyses, demonstrating
  the validity and effectiveness of our proposed method.
