title: 'Enabling Few-Shot Learning with PID Control: A Layer Adaptive Optimizer'
openreview: LabSWooau0
abstract: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and its variants have shown remarkable
  performance in scenarios characterized by a scarcity of labeled data during the
  training phase of machine learning models. Despite these successes, MAMLbased approaches
  encounter significant challenges when there is a substantial discrepancy in the
  distribution of training and testing tasks, resulting in inefficient learning and
  limited generalization across domains. Inspired by classical proportional-integral-derivative
  (PID) control theory, this study introduces a Layer-Adaptive PID (LA-PID) Optimizer,
  a MAML-based optimizer that employs efficient parameter optimization methods to
  dynamically adjust task-specific PID control gains at each layer of the network,
  conducting a first-principles analysis of optimal convergence conditions. A series
  of experiments conducted on four standard benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy
  of the LA-PID optimizer, indicating that LA-PID achieves state-oftheart performance
  in few-shot classification and cross-domain tasks, accomplishing these objectives
  with fewer training steps. Code is available on https://github.com/yuguopin/LA-PID.
