title: 'Towards Generalization beyond Pointwise Learning: A Unified Information-theoretic
  Perspective'
openreview: yXlQL9goY8
abstract: The recent surge in contrastive learning has intensified the interest in
  understanding the generalization of non-pointwise learning paradigms. While information-theoretic
  analysis achieves remarkable success in characterizing the generalization behavior
  of learning algorithms, its applicability is largely confined to pointwise learning,
  with extensions to the simplest pairwise settings remaining unexplored due to the
  challenges of non-i.i.d losses and dimensionality explosion. In this paper, we develop
  the first series of information-theoretic bounds extending beyond pointwise scenarios,
  encompassing pointwise, pairwise, triplet, quadruplet, and higher-order scenarios,
  all within a unified framework. Specifically, our hypothesis-based bounds elucidate
  the generalization behavior of iterative and noisy learning algorithms via gradient
  covariance analysis, and our prediction-based bounds accurately estimate the generalization
  gap with computationally tractable low-dimensional information metrics. Comprehensive
  numerical studies then demonstrate the effectiveness of our bounds in capturing
  the generalization dynamics across diverse learning scenarios.
