title: AlphaFold Meets Flow Matching for Generating Protein Ensembles
openreview: rs8Sh2UASt
abstract: The biological functions of proteins often depend on dynamic structural
  ensembles. In this work, we develop a flow-based generative modeling approach for
  learning and sampling the conformational landscapes of proteins. We repurpose highly
  accurate single-state predictors such as AlphaFold and ESMFold and fine-tune them
  under a custom flow matching framework to obtain sequence-conditioned generative
  models of protein structure called AlphaFlow and ESMFlow. When trained and evaluated
  on the PDB, our method provides a superior combination of precision and diversity
  compared to AlphaFold with MSA subsampling. When further trained on ensembles from
  all-atom MD, our method accurately captures conformational flexibility, positional
  distributions, and higher-order ensemble observables for unseen proteins. Moreover,
  our method can diversify a static PDB structure with faster wall-clock convergence
  to certain equilibrium properties than replicate MD trajectories, demonstrating
  its potential as a proxy for expensive physics-based simulations. Code is available
  at https://github.com/bjing2016/alphaflow.
