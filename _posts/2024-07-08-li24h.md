title: Learning Causal Domain-Invariant Temporal Dynamics for Few-Shot Action Recognition
openreview: LvuuYqU0BW
abstract: Few-shot action recognition aims at quickly adapting a pre-trained model
  to the novel data with a distribution shift using only a limited number of samples.
  Key challenges include how to identify and leverage the transferable knowledge learned
  by the pre-trained model. We therefore propose CDTD, or Causal Domain-Invariant
  Temporal Dynamics for knowledge transfer. To identify the temporally invariant and
  variant representations, we employ the causal representation learning methods for
  unsupervised pertaining, and then tune the classifier with supervisions in next
  stage. Specifically, we assume the domain information can be well estimated and
  the pre-trained temporal dynamic generation and transition models can be well transferred.
  During adaptation, we fix the transferable temporal dynamics and update the image
  encoder and domain estimator. The efficacy of our approach is revealed by the superior
  accuracy of CDTD over leading alternatives across standard few-shot action recognition
  datasets.
