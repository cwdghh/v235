title: Auto-Encoding Morph-Tokens for Multimodal LLM
openreview: U97MIrs35l
abstract: 'For multimodal LLMs, the synergy of visual comprehension (textual output)
  and generation (visual output) presents an ongoing challenge. This is due to a conflicting
  objective: for comprehension, an MLLM needs to abstract the visuals; for generation,
  it needs to preserve the visuals as much as possible. Thus, the objective is a dilemma
  for visual-tokens. To resolve the conflict, we propose encoding images into morph-tokens
  to serve a dual purpose: for comprehension, they act as visual prompts instructing
  MLLM to generate texts; for generation, they take on a different, non-conflicting
  role as complete visual-tokens for image reconstruction, where the missing visual
  cues are recovered by the MLLM. Extensive experiments show that morph-tokens can
  achieve a new SOTA for multimodal comprehension and generation simultaneously. Our
  project is available at https://github.com/DCDmllm/MorphTokens.'
