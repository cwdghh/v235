title: Inexact Newton-type Methods for Optimisation with Nonnegativity Constraints
openreview: p7gpooFIr3
abstract: We consider solving large scale nonconvex optimisation problems with nonnegativity
  constraints. Such problems arise frequently in machine learning, such as nonnegative
  least-squares, nonnegative matrix factorisation, as well as problems with sparsity-inducing
  regularisation. In such settings, first-order methods, despite their simplicity,
  can be prohibitively slow on ill-conditioned problems or become trapped near saddle
  regions, while most second-order alternatives involve non-trivially challenging
  subproblems. The two-metric projection framework, initially proposed by Bertsekas
  (1982), alleviates these issues and achieves the best of both worlds by combining
  projected gradient steps at the boundary of the feasible region with Newton steps
  in the interior in such a way that feasibility can be maintained by simple projection
  onto the nonnegative orthant. We develop extensions of the two-metric projection
  framework, which by inexactly solving the subproblems as well as employing non-positive
  curvature directions, are suitable for large scale and nonconvex settings. We obtain
  state-of-the-art convergence rates for various classes of non-convex problems and
  demonstrate competitive practical performance on a variety of problems.
