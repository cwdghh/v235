title: 'Neural SPH: Improved Neural Modeling of Lagrangian Fluid Dynamics'
openreview: Pbey7LqBRl
abstract: Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is omnipresent in modern engineering
  and scientific disciplines. SPH is a class of Lagrangian schemes that discretize
  fluid dynamics via finite material points that are tracked through the evolving
  velocity field. Due to the particle-like nature of the simulation, graph neural
  networks (GNNs) have emerged as appealing and successful surrogates. However, the
  practical utility of such GNN-based simulators relies on their ability to faithfully
  model physics, providing accurate and stable predictions over long time horizons
  - which is a notoriously hard problem. In this work, we identify particle clustering
  originating from tensile instabilities as one of the primary pitfalls. Based on
  these insights, we enhance both training and rollout inference of state-of-the-art
  GNN-based simulators with varying components from standard SPH solvers, including
  pressure, viscous, and external force components. All Neural SPH-enhanced simulators
  achieve better performance than the baseline GNNs, often by orders of magnitude
  in terms of rollout error, allowing for significantly longer rollouts and significantly
  better physics modeling. Code available under https://github.com/tumaer/neuralsph.
