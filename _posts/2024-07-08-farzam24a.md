title: From Geometry to Causality- Ricci Curvature and the Reliability of Causal Inference
  on Networks
openreview: 4DAl3IsvlU
abstract: Causal inference on networks faces challenges posed in part by violations
  of standard identification assumptions due to dependencies between treatment units.
  Although graph geometry fundamentally influences such dependencies, the potential
  of geometric tools for causal inference on networked treatment units is yet to be
  unlocked. Moreover, despite significant progress utilizing graph neural networks
  (GNNs) for causal inference on networks, methods for evaluating their achievable
  reliability without ground truth are lacking. In this work we establish for the
  first time a theoretical link between network geometry, the graph Ricci curvature
  in particular, and causal inference, formalizing the intrinsic challenges that negative
  curvature poses to estimating causal parameters. The Ricci curvature can then be
  used to assess the reliability of causal estimates in structured data, as we empirically
  demonstrate. Informed by this finding, we propose a method using the geometric Ricci
  flow to reduce causal effect estimation error in networked data, showcasing how
  this newfound connection between graph geometry and causal inference could improve
  GNN-based causal inference. Bridging graph geometry and causal inference, this paper
  opens the door to geometric techniques for improving causal estimation on networks.
