title: Enhancing Cross-Modal Fine-Tuning with Gradually Intermediate Modality Generation
openreview: YlcSyCz21c
abstract: Large-scale pretrained models have proven immensely valuable in handling
  data-intensive modalities like text and image. However, fine-tuning these models
  for certain specialized modalities, such as protein sequence and cosmic ray, poses
  challenges due to the significant modality discrepancy and scarcity of labeled data.
  In this paper, we propose an end-to-end method, <b>PaRe</b>, to enhance cross-modal
  fine-tuning, aiming to transfer a large-scale pretrained model to various target
  modalities. <b>PaRe</b> employs a gating mechanism to select key patches from both
  source and target data. Through a modality-agnostic <b>Pa</b>tch <b>Re</b>placement
  scheme, these patches are preserved and combined to construct data-rich intermediate
  modalities ranging from easy to hard. By gradually intermediate modality generation,
  we can not only effectively bridge the modality gap to enhance stability and transferability
  of cross-modal fine-tuning, but also address the challenge of limited data in the
  target modality by leveraging enriched intermediate modality data. Compared with
  hand-designed, general-purpose, task-specific, and state-of-the-art cross-modal
  fine-tuning approaches, <b>PaRe</b> demonstrates superior performance across three
  challenging benchmarks, encompassing more than ten modalities.
