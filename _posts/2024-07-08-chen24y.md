title: Toward Adaptive Reasoning in Large Language Models with Thought Rollback
openreview: aoAPOOtN9E
abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been routinely used to solve various tasks
  using step-by-step reasoning. However, the structure of intermediate reasoning steps,
  or <em>thoughts</em>, is rigid and unidirectional, such as chains, trees, or acyclic-directed
  graphs. Consequently, the resulting inflexible and forward-only reasoning may not
  address challenging tasks and fail when the LLM frequently gives false responses,
  i.e., hallucinations. This paper proposes a new reasoning framework, called <em>Thought
  Rollback</em> (TR), allowing LLMs to adaptively build thought structure while maintaining
  effective reasoning toward problem-solving under hallucinations. The core mechanism
  of TR is <em>rolling back thoughts</em>, which allows LLMs to perform error analysis
  on thoughts, and thus roll back to any previously mistaken thought for revision.
  Subsequently, by including such trial-and-error in the prompt to guide the LLM,
  each rollback leads to one more reliable reasoning path. Therefore, starting with
  a simple prompt without human annotations, LLM with TR adaptively and gradually
  explores thoughts for a correct solution. Comprehensive experiments on mathematical
  problems and multi-task reasoning demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of
  TR in terms of problem-solving rate and interaction cost. For instance, the solving
  rate of GPT-4 with TR outperforms the current best by $9%$ on the MATH dataset.
