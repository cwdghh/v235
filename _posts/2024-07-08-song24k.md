title: Generative Enzyme Design Guided by Functionally Important Sites and Small-Molecule
  Substrates
openreview: ATvN9JnqZ8
abstract: Enzymes are genetically encoded biocatalysts capable of accelerating chemical
  reactions. How can we automatically design functional enzymes? In this paper, we
  propose EnzyGen, an approach to learn a unified model to design enzymes across all
  functional families. Our key idea is to generate an enzyme’s amino acid sequence
  and their three-dimensional (3D) coordinates based on functionally important sites
  and substrates corresponding to a desired catalytic function. These sites are automatically
  mined from enzyme databases. EnzyGen consists of a novel interleaving network of
  attention and neighborhood equivariant layers, which captures both long-range correlation
  in an entire protein sequence and local influence from nearest amino acids in 3D
  space. To learn the generative model, we devise a joint training objective, including
  a sequence generation loss, a position prediction loss and an enzyme-substrate interaction
  loss. We further construct EnzyBench, a dataset with 3157 enzyme families, covering
  all available enzymes within the protein data bank (PDB). Experimental results show
  that our EnzyGen consistently achieves the best performance across all 323 testing
  families, surpassing the best baseline by 10.79% in terms of substrate binding affinity.
  These findings demonstrate EnzyGen’s superior capability in designing well-folded
  and effective enzymes binding to specific substrates with high affinities. Our code,
  model and dataset are provided at https://github.com/LeiLiLab/EnzyGen.
