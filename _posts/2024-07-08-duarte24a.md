title: 'DE-COP: Detecting Copyrighted Content in Language Models Training Data'
openreview: LO4xhXmFal
abstract: "<em>How can we detect if copyrighted content was used in the training process
  of a language model, considering that the training data is typically undisclosed?</em>
  We are motivated by the premise that a language model is likely to identify verbatim
  excerpts from its training text. We propose DE-COP, a method to determine whether
  a piece of copyrighted content is included in training. DE-COP’s core approach is
  to probe an LLM with multiple-choice questions, whose options include both verbatim
  text and their paraphrases. We construct BookTection, a benchmark with excerpts
  from 165 books published prior and subsequent to a model’s training cutoff, along
  with their paraphrases. Our experiments show that DE-COP outperforms the prior best
  method by 8.6% in detection accuracy (AUC) on models with logits available. Moreover,
  DE-COP also achieves an average accuracy of 72% for detecting suspect books on fully
  black-box models where prior methods give approximately 0% accuracy. The code and
  datasets are available at https://github.com/LeiLiLab/DE-COP."
