title: 'MusicRL: Aligning Music Generation to Human Preferences'
openreview: EruV94XRDs
abstract: We propose MusicRL, the first music generation system finetuned from human
  feedback. Appreciation of text-to-music models is particularly subjective since
  the concept of musicality as well as the specific intention behind a caption are
  user-dependent (e.g. a caption such as “upbeat workout music” can map to a retro
  guitar solo or a technopop beat). Not only this makes supervised training of such
  models challenging, but it also calls for integrating continuous human feedback
  in their post-deployment finetuning. MusicRL is a pretrained autoregressive MusicLM
  model of discrete audio tokens finetuned with reinforcement learning to maximize
  sequence-level rewards. We design reward functions related specifically to text-adherence
  and audio quality with the help from selected raters, and use those to finetune
  MusicLM into MusicRL-R. We deploy MusicLM to users and collect a substantial dataset
  comprising 300,000 pairwise preferences. Using Reinforcement Learning from Human
  Feedback (RLHF), we train MusicRL-U, the first text-to-music model that incorporates
  human feedback at scale. Human evaluations show that both MusicRL-R and MusicRL-U
  are preferred to the baseline. Ultimately, MusicRL-RU combines the two approaches
  and results in the best model according to human raters. Ablation studies shed light
  on the musical attributes influencing human preferences, indicating that text adherence
  and quality only account for a part of it. This underscores the prevalence of subjectivity
  in musical appreciation and calls for further involvement of human listeners in
  the finetuning of music generation models. Samples can be found at google-research.github.io/seanet/musiclm/rlhf/.
