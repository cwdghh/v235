title: 'eCeLLM: Generalizing Large Language Models for E-commerce from Large-scale,
  High-quality Instruction Data'
openreview: LWRI4uPG2X
abstract: With tremendous efforts on developing effective e-commerce models, conventional
  e-commerce models show limited success in generalist e-commerce modeling, and suffer
  from unsatisfactory performance on new users and new products â€“ a typical out-of-domain
  generalization challenge. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) demonstrate outstanding
  performance in generalist modeling and out-of-domain generalizability in many fields.
  Toward fully unleashing their power for e-commerce, in this paper, we construct
  ECInstruct, the first open-sourced, large-scale, and high-quality benchmark instruction
  dataset for e-commerce. Leveraging ECInstruct, we develop eCeLLM, a series of e-commerce
  LLMs, by instruction-tuning general-purpose LLMs. Our comprehensive experiments
  and evaluation demonstrate that eCeLLM models substantially outperform baseline
  models, including the most advanced GPT-4, and the state-of-the-art task-specific
  models in in-domain evaluation. Moreover, eCeLLM exhibits excellent generalizability
  to out-of-domain settings, including unseen products and unseen instructions, highlighting
  its superiority as a generalist e-commerce model. Both the ECInstruct dataset and
  the eCeLLM models show great potential in empowering versatile and effective LLMs
  for e-commerce. ECInstruct and eCeLLM models are publicly accessible through this
  link.
