title: Non-stationary Online Convex Optimization with Arbitrary Delays
openreview: YvPNwLedpQ
abstract: Online convex optimization (OCO) with arbitrary delays, in which gradients
  or other information of functions could be arbitrarily delayed, has received increasing
  attention recently. Different from previous studies that focus on stationary environments,
  this paper investigates the delayed OCO in non-stationary environments, and aims
  to minimize the dynamic regret with respect to any sequence of comparators. To this
  end, we first propose a simple algorithm, namely DOGD, which performs a gradient
  descent step for each delayed gradient according to their arrival order. Despite
  its simplicity, our novel analysis shows that the dynamic regret of DOGD can be
  automatically bounded by $O(\sqrt{\bar{d}T}(P_T+1))$ under mild assumptions, and
  $O(\sqrt{dT}(P_T+1))$ in the worst case, where $\bar{d}$ and $d$ denote the average
  and maximum delay respectively, $T$ is the time horizon, and $P_T$ is the path-length
  of comparators. Furthermore, we develop an improved algorithm, which reduces those
  dynamic regret bounds achieved by DOGD to $O(\sqrt{\bar{d}T(P_T+1)})$ and $O(\sqrt{dT(P_T+1)})$,
  respectively. The key idea is to run multiple DOGD with different learning rates,
  and utilize a meta-algorithm to track the best one based on their delayed performance.
  Finally, we demonstrate that our improved algorithm is optimal in the worst case
  by deriving a matching lower bound.
