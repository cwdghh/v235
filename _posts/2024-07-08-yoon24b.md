title: Optimal Acceleration for Minimax and Fixed-Point Problems is Not Unique
openreview: ZeF75iQcAc
abstract: Recently, accelerated algorithms using the anchoring mechanism for minimax
  optimization and fixed-point problems have been proposed, and matching complexity
  lower bounds establish their optimality. In this work, we present the surprising
  observation that the optimal acceleration mechanism in minimax optimization and
  fixed-point problems is not unique. Our new algorithms achieve exactly the same
  worst-case convergence rates as existing anchor-based methods while using materially
  different acceleration mechanisms. Specifically, these new algorithms are dual to
  the prior anchor-based accelerated methods in the sense of H-duality. This finding
  opens a new avenue of research on accelerated algorithms since we now have a family
  of methods that empirically exhibit varied characteristics while having the same
  optimal worst-case guarantee.
