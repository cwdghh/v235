title: A Study of First-Order Methods with a Deterministic Relative-Error Gradient
  Oracle
openreview: OndZHBUA1G
abstract: 'This paper studies the theoretical guarantees of the classical projected
  gradient and conditional gradient methods applied to constrained optimization problems
  with biased relative-error gradient oracles. These oracles are used in various settings,
  such as distributed optimization systems or derivative-free optimization, and are
  particularly common when gradients are compressed, quantized, or estimated via finite
  differences computations. Several settings are investigated: Optimization over the
  box with a coordinate-wise erroneous gradient oracle, optimization over a general
  compact convex set, and three more specific scenarios. Convergence guarantees are
  established with respect to the relative-error magnitude, and in particular, we
  show that the conditional gradient is invariant to relative-error when applied over
  the box with a coordinate-wise erroneous gradient oracle, and the projected gradient
  maintains its convergence guarantees when optimizing a nonconvex objective function.'
