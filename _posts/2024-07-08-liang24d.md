title: Single-Trajectory Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning
openreview: 3B6vmW2L80
abstract: To mitigate the limitation that the classical reinforcement learning (RL)
  framework heavily relies on identical training and test environments, Distributionally
  Robust RL (DRRL) has been proposed to enhance performance across a range of environments,
  possibly including unknown test environments. As a price for robustness gain, DRRL
  involves optimizing over a set of distributions, which is inherently more challenging
  than optimizing over a fixed distribution in the non-robust case. Existing DRRL
  algorithms are either model-based or fail to learn from a single sample trajectory.
  In this paper, we design a first fully model-free DRRL algorithm, called distributionally
  robust Q-learning with single trajectory (DRQ). We delicately design a multi-timescale
  framework to fully utilize each incrementally arriving sample and directly learn
  the optimal distributionally robust policy without modeling the environment, thus
  the algorithm can be trained along a single trajectory in a model-free fashion.
  Despite the algorithmâ€™s complexity, we provide asymptotic convergence guarantees
  by generalizing classical stochastic approximation tools.Comprehensive experimental
  results demonstrate the superior robustness and sample complexity of our proposed
  algorithm, compared to non-robust methods and other robust RL algorithms.
