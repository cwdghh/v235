title: Efficient Algorithms for Sum-Of-Minimum Optimization
openreview: jsmaWEdx9g
abstract: In this work, we propose a novel optimization model termed “sum-of-minimum"
  optimization. This model seeks to minimize the sum or average of $N$ objective functions
  over $k$ parameters, where each objective takes the minimum value of a predefined
  sub-function with respect to the $k$ parameters. This universal framework encompasses
  numerous clustering applications in machine learning and related fields. We develop
  efficient algorithms for solving sum-of-minimum optimization problems, inspired
  by a randomized initialization algorithm for the classic $k$-means (Arthur & Vassilvitskii,
  2007) and Lloyd’s algorithm (Lloyd, 1982). We establish a new tight bound for the
  generalized initialization algorithm and prove a gradient-descent-like convergence
  rate for generalized Lloyd’s algorithm. The efficiency of our algorithms is numerically
  examined on multiple tasks, including generalized principal component analysis,
  mixed linear regression, and small-scale neural network training. Our approach compares
  favorably to previous ones based on simpler-but-less-precise optimization reformulations.
