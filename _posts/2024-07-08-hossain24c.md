title: 'Multi-Sender Persuasion: A Computational Perspective'
openreview: 8JFIKpzumn
abstract: We consider <em>multiple senders</em> with informational advantage signaling
  to convince a single self-interested actor to take certain actions. Generalizing
  the seminal <em>Bayesian Persuasion</em> framework, such settings are ubiquitous
  in computational economics, multi-agent learning, and machine learning with multiple
  objectives. The core solution concept here is the Nash equilibrium of senders’ signaling
  policies. Theoretically, we prove that finding an equilibrium in general is PPAD-Hard;
  in fact, even computing a sender’s best response is NP-Hard. Given these intrinsic
  difficulties, we turn to finding local Nash equilibria. We propose a novel differentiable
  neural network to approximate this game’s non-linear and discontinuous utilities.
  Complementing this with the extra-gradient algorithm, we discover local equilibria
  that Pareto dominates full-revelation equilibria and those found by existing neural
  networks. Broadly, our theoretical and empirical contributions are of interest to
  a large class of economic problems.
