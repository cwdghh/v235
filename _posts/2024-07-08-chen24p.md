title: On Interpolating Experts and Multi-Armed Bandits
openreview: qIiPM5CbRY
abstract: Learning with expert advice and multi-armed bandit are two classic online
  decision problems which differ on how the information is observed in each round
  of the game. We study a family of problems interpolating the two. For a vector $\mathbf{m}=(m_1,â€¦,m_K)\in
  \mathbb N^K$, an instance of $\mathbf m$-MAB indicates that the arms are partitioned
  into $K$ groups and the $i$-th group contains $m_i$ arms. Once an arm is pulled,
  the losses of all arms in the same group are observed. We prove tight minimax regret
  bounds for $\mathbf m$-MAB and design an optimal PAC algorithm for its pure exploration
  version, $\mathbf m$-BAI, where the goal is to identify the arm with minimum loss
  with as few rounds as possible. We show that the minimax regret of $\mathbf m$-MAB
  is $\Theta\left(\sqrt{T\sum_{k=1}^K\log (m_k+1)}\right)$ and the minimum number
  of pulls for an $(\varepsilon,0.05)$-PAC algorithm of $\mathbf m$-BAI is $\Theta\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}\cdot
  \sum_{k=1}^K\log (m_k+1)\right)$. Both our upper bounds and lower bounds for $\mathbf
  m$-MAB can be extended to a more general setting, namely the bandit with graph feedback,
  in terms of the <em>clique cover</em> and related graph parameters. As consequences,
  we obtained tight minimax regret bounds for several families of feedback graphs.
