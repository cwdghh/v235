title: 'FADAS: Towards Federated Adaptive Asynchronous Optimization'
openreview: j56JAd29uH
abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a widely adopted training paradigm
  for privacy-preserving machine learning. While the SGD-based FL algorithms have
  demonstrated considerable success in the past, there is a growing trend towards
  adopting adaptive federated optimization methods, particularly for the training
  of large-scale models. However, the conventional synchronous aggregation design
  poses a significant challenge to the practical deployment of those adaptive federated
  optimization methods, particularly in the presence of straggler clients. To fill
  this research gap, this paper introduces federated adaptive asynchronous optimization,
  named FADAS, a novel method that incorporates asynchronous updates into adaptive
  federated optimization with provable guarantees. To further enhance the efficiency
  and resilience of our proposed method in scenarios with significant asynchronous
  delays, we also extend FADAS with a delay-adaptive learning adjustment strategy.
  We rigorously establish the convergence rate of the proposed algorithms and empirical
  results demonstrate the superior performance of FADAS over other asynchronous FL
  baselines.
