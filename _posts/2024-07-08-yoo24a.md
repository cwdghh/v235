title: 'Layerwise Proximal Replay: A Proximal Point Method for Online Continual Learning'
openreview: Lg8nw3ltvX
abstract: 'In online continual learning, a neural network incrementally learns from
  a non-i.i.d. data stream. Nearly all online continual learning methods employ experience
  replay to simultaneously prevent catastrophic forgetting and underfitting on past
  data. Our work demonstrates a limitation of this approach: neural networks trained
  with experience replay tend to have unstable optimization trajectories, impeding
  their overall accuracy. Surprisingly, these instabilities persist even when the
  replay buffer stores all previous training examples, suggesting that this issue
  is orthogonal to catastrophic forgetting. We minimize these instabilities through
  a simple modification of the optimization geometry. Our solution, Layerwise Proximal
  Replay (LPR), balances learning from new and replay data while only allowing for
  gradual changes in the hidden activation of past data. We demonstrate that LPR consistently
  improves replay-based online continual learning across multiple problem settings,
  regardless of the amount of available replay memory.'
