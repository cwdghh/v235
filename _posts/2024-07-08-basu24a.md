title: A Statistical Framework for Data-dependent Retrieval-Augmented Models
openreview: A9MiJdetnZ
abstract: 'Modern ML systems increasingly augment input instances with additional
  relevant information to enhance final prediction. Despite growing interest in such
  retrieval-augmented models, their fundamental properties and training are not well
  understood. We propose a statistical framework to study such models with two components:
  1) a retriever to identify the relevant information out of a large corpus via a
  data-dependent metric; and 2) a predictor that consumes the input instances along
  with the retrieved information to make the final predictions. We present a principled
  method for end-to-end training of both components and draw connections with various
  training approaches in the literature. Furthermore, we establish excess risk bounds
  for retrieval-augmented models while delineating the contributions of both retriever
  and predictor towards the model performance.We validate the utility of our proposed
  training methods along with the key takeaways from our statistical analysis on open
  domain question answering task where retrieval augmentation is important.'
