title: Agent Instructs Large Language Models to be General Zero-Shot Reasoners
openreview: zMwFvxr6CV
abstract: We introduce a method to improve the zero-shot reasoning abilities of large
  language models on general language understanding tasks. Specifically, we build
  an autonomous agent to instruct the reasoning process of large language models.
  To enable this, our agent only needs to generate a single set of instructions for
  each task. These instructions turn out to be extremely effective for improving the
  reasoning process of different large language models across all task instances.
  We show this approach further unleashes the zero-shot reasoning abilities of large
  language models to more tasks. We study the performance of our method on a wide
  set of datasets spanning generation, classification, and reasoning. We show that
  our method generalizes to most tasks and obtains state-of-the-art zero-shot performance
  on 20 of the 29 datasets that we evaluate. For instance, our method boosts the performance
  of state-of-the-art large language models by a large margin, including Vicuna-13b,
  Llama-2-70b-chat, and GPT-3.5 Turbo. Compared to zero-shot chain of thought, our
  improvement in reasoning is striking. With our method, Llama-2-70b-chat outperforms
  zero-shot GPT-3.5 Turbo significantly.
