title: 'Position: Future Directions in the Theory of Graph Machine Learning'
openreview: wBr5ozDEKp
abstract: Machine learning on graphs, especially using graph neural networks (GNNs),
  has seen a surge in interest due to the wide availability of graph data across a
  broad spectrum of disciplines, from life to social and engineering sciences. Despite
  their practical success, our theoretical understanding of the properties of GNNs
  remains highly incomplete. Recent theoretical advancements primarily focus on elucidating
  the coarse-grained expressive power of GNNs, predominantly employing combinatorial
  techniques. However, these studies do not perfectly align with practice, particularly
  in understanding the generalization behavior of GNNs when trained with stochastic
  first-order optimization techniques. In this position paper, we argue that the graph
  machine learning community needs to shift its attention to developing a balanced
  theory of graph machine learning, focusing on a more thorough understanding of the
  interplay of expressive power, generalization, and optimization.
