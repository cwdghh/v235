title: 'PinNet: Pinpoint Instructive Information for Retrieval Augmented Code-to-Text
  Generation'
openreview: TqcZfMZjgM
abstract: Automatically generating high-quality code descriptions greatly improves
  the readability and maintainability of the codebase. Recently, retrieval augmented
  code-to-text generation has proven to be an effective solution, which has achieved
  state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks. It brings out the potential to leverage
  large unlabeled code descriptions to further improve the generation quality. Despite
  the promising performance, retrieval-augmented models however suffer from being
  deluded by inconducive retrieved references, due to irrelevant or even misleading
  information contained therein. To this end, we design PinNet, a new framework for
  code-to-text generation. PinNet relies on a discriminator to measure how well the
  retrievals match the semantics of the input code. Remarkably, the hidden representation
  of the reference before the output layer of the discriminator can be leveraged to
  significantly improve the code-to-text generation by modifying the attention weights.
  It essentially pays high attention to valuable information and eliminates misleadingness.
  To effectively execute this idea, we also propose a novel contrastive learning method
  to quantify the semantical similarities between unlabeled references. Using extensive
  experiments on code summarization and SQL-to-text generation, we demonstrate that
  the proposed method can significantly outperform all of the baselines.
