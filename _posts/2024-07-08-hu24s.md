title: 'InfiAgent-DABench: Evaluating Agents on Data Analysis Tasks'
openreview: d5LURMSfTx
abstract: In this paper, we introduce InfiAgent-DABench, the first benchmark specifically
  designed to evaluate LLM-based agents on data analysis tasks. Agents need to solve
  these tasks end-to-end by interacting with an execution environment. This benchmark
  contains DAEval, a dataset consisting of 603 data analysis questions derived from
  124 CSV files, and an agent framework which incorporates LLMs to serve as data analysis
  agents for both serving and evaluating. Since data analysis questions are often
  open-ended and hard to evaluate without human supervision, we adopt a format-prompting
  technique to convert each question into a closed-form format so that they can be
  automatically evaluated. Our extensive benchmarking of 34 LLMs uncovers the current
  challenges encountered in data analysis tasks. In addition, building upon our agent
  framework, we develop a specialized agent, DAAgent, which surpasses GPT-3.5 by 3.9%
  on DABench. Evaluation datasets and toolkits for InfiAgent-DABench are released
  at https://github.com/InfiAgent/InfiAgent.
