title: Auditing Private Prediction
openreview: FVmqX0sYz9
abstract: 'Differential privacy (DP) offers a theoretical upper bound on the potential
  privacy leakage of an algorithm, while empirical auditing establishes a practical
  lower bound. Auditing techniques exist for DP training algorithms. However machine
  learning can also be made private at inference. We propose the first framework for
  auditing private prediction where we instantiate adversaries with varying poisoning
  and query capabilities. This enables us to study the privacy leakage of four private
  prediction algorithms: PATE (Papernot et al., 2016), CaPC (Choquette-Choo et al.,
  2020), PromptPATE (Duan et al., 2023), and Private-kNN (Zhu et al., 2020). To conduct
  our audit, we introduce novel techniques to empirically evaluate privacy leakage
  in terms of Renyi DP. Our experiments show that (i) the privacy analysis of private
  prediction can be improved, (ii) algorithms which are easier to poison lead to much
  higher privacy leakage, and (iii) the privacy leakage is significantly lower for
  adversaries without query control than those with full control.'
