title: Longitudinal Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation with Temporal-Difference
  Heterogeneous Transformer
openreview: CHz7WshPcp
abstract: We propose Deep Longitudinal Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation (Deep
  LTMLE), a novel approach to estimate the counterfactual mean of outcome under dynamic
  treatment policies in longitudinal problem settings. Our approach utilizes a transformer
  architecture with heterogeneous type embedding trained using temporal-difference
  learning. After obtaining an initial estimate using the transformer, following the
  targeted minimum loss-based likelihood estimation (TMLE) framework, we statistically
  corrected for the bias commonly associated with machine learning algorithms. Furthermore,
  our method also facilitates statistical inference by enabling the provision of 95%
  confidence intervals grounded in asymptotic statistical theory. Simulation results
  demonstrate our methodâ€™s superior performance over existing approaches, particularly
  in complex, long time-horizon scenarios. It remains effective in small-sample, short-duration
  contexts, matching the performance of asymptotically efficient estimators. To demonstrate
  our method in practice, we applied our method to estimate counterfactual mean outcomes
  for standard versus intensive blood pressure management strategies in a real-world
  cardiovascular epidemiology cohort study.
