title: 'IOI: Invisible One-Iteration Adversarial Attack on No-Reference Image- and
  Video-Quality Metrics'
openreview: Chy4rSqy4Y
abstract: 'No-reference image- and video-quality metrics are widely used in video
  processing benchmarks. The robustness of learning-based metrics under video attacks
  has not been widely studied. In addition to having success, attacks on metrics that
  can be employed in video processing benchmarks must be fast and imperceptible. This
  paper introduces an Invisible One-Iteration (IOI) adversarial attack on no-reference
  image and video quality metrics. The proposed method uses two modules to ensure
  high visual quality and temporal stability of adversarial videos and runs for one
  iteration, which makes it fast. We compared our method alongside eight prior approaches
  using image and video datasets via objective and subjective tests. Our method exhibited
  superior visual quality across various attacked metric architectures while maintaining
  comparable attack success and speed. We made the code available on GitHub: https://github.com/katiashh/ioi-attack.'
