title: Generating In-Distribution Proxy Graphs for Explaining Graph Neural Networks
openreview: ohG9bVMs5j
abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a building block in graph data
  processing, with wide applications in critical domains. The growing needs to deploy
  GNNs in high-stakes applications necessitate explainability for users in the decision-making
  processes. A popular paradigm for the explainability of GNNs is to identify explainable
  subgraphs by comparing their labels with the ones of original graphs. This task
  is challenging due to the substantial distributional shift from the original graphs
  in the training set to the set of explainable subgraphs, which prevents accurate
  prediction of labels with the subgraphs. To address it, in this paper, we propose
  a novel method that generates proxy graphs for explainable subgraphs that are in
  the distribution of training data. We introduce a parametric method that employs
  graph generators to produce proxy graphs. A new training objective based on information
  theory is designed to ensure that proxy graphs not only adhere to the distribution
  of training data but also preserve explanatory factors. Such generated proxy graphs
  can be reliably used to approximate the predictions of the labels of explainable
  subgraphs. Empirical evaluations across various datasets demonstrate our method
  achieves more accurate explanations for GNNs.
