title: Safe Exploration in Dose Finding Clinical Trials with Heterogeneous Participants
openreview: ZUXvpIrz5l
abstract: In drug development, early phase dose-finding clinical trials are carried
  out to identify an optimal dose to administer to patients in larger confirmatory
  clinical trials. Standard trial procedures do not optimize for participant benefit
  and do not consider participant heterogeneity, despite consequences to participantsâ€™
  health and downstream impacts to under-represented population subgroups. Many novel
  drugs also do not obey parametric modelling assumptions made in common dose-finding
  procedures. We present Safe Allocation for Exploration of Treatments SAFE-T, a procedure
  for adaptive dose-finding that adheres to safety constraints, improves utility for
  heterogeneous participants, and works well with small sample sizes. SAFE-T flexibly
  learns non-parametric multi-output Gaussian process models for dose toxicity and
  efficacy, using Bayesian optimization, and provides accurate final dose recommendations.
  We provide theoretical guarantees for the satisfaction of safety constraints. Using
  a comprehensive set of realistic synthetic scenarios, we demonstrate empirically
  that SAFE-T generally outperforms comparable methods and maintains performance across
  variations in sample size and subgroup distribution. Finally, we extend SAFE-T to
  a new adaptive setting, demonstrating its potential to improve traditional clinical
  trial procedures.
