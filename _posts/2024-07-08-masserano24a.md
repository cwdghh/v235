title: Classification under Nuisance Parameters and Generalized Label Shift in Likelihood-Free
  Inference
openreview: RXxTuxPopa
abstract: An open scientific challenge is how to classify events with reliable measures
  of uncertainty, when we have a mechanistic model of the data-generating process
  but the distribution over both labels and latent nuisance parameters is different
  between train and target data. We refer to this type of distributional shift as
  generalized label shift (GLS). Direct classification using observed data $\mathbf{X}$
  as covariates leads to biased predictions and invalid uncertainty estimates of labels
  $Y$. We overcome these biases by proposing a new method for robust uncertainty quantification
  that casts classification as a hypothesis testing problem under nuisance parameters.
  The key idea is to estimate the classifierâ€™s receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
  across the entire nuisance parameter space, which allows us to devise cutoffs that
  are invariant under GLS. Our method effectively endows a pre-trained classifier
  with domain adaptation capabilities and returns valid prediction sets while maintaining
  high power. We demonstrate its performance on two challenging scientific problems
  in biology and astroparticle physics with data from realistic mechanistic models.
