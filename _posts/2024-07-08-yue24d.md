title: Image Restoration Through Generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Bridge
openreview: oDUJmNCV8D
abstract: Diffusion models exhibit powerful generative capabilities enabling noise
  mapping to data via reverse stochastic differential equations. However, in image
  restoration, the focus is on the mapping relationship from low-quality to high-quality
  images. Regarding this issue, we introduce the Generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Bridge
  (GOUB) model. By leveraging the natural mean-reverting property of the generalized
  OU process and further eliminating the variance of its steady-state distribution
  through the Doob’s <em>h</em>–transform, we achieve diffusion mappings from point
  to point enabling the recovery of high-quality images from low-quality ones. Moreover,
  we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence shared by various bridge models,
  all of which are special instances of GOUB and empirically demonstrate the optimality
  of our proposed models. Additionally, we present the corresponding Mean-ODE model
  adept at capturing both pixel-level details and structural perceptions. Experimental
  outcomes showcase the state-of-the-art performance achieved by both models across
  diverse tasks, including inpainting, deraining, and super-resolution. Code is available
  at https://github.com/Hammour-steak/GOUB.
