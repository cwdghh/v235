title: 'RNAFlow: RNA Structure & Sequence Design via Inverse Folding-Based Flow Matching'
openreview: jxvqvZLBuU
abstract: The growing significance of RNA engineering in diverse biological applications
  has spurred interest in developing AI methods for structure-based RNA design. While
  diffusion models have excelled in protein design, adapting them for RNA presents
  new challenges due to RNA’s conformational flexibility and the computational cost
  of fine-tuning large structure prediction models. To this end, we propose RNAFlow,
  a flow matching model for protein-conditioned RNA sequence-structure design. Its
  denoising network integrates an RNA inverse folding model and a pre-trained RosettaFold2NA
  network for generation of RNA sequences and structures. The integration of inverse
  folding in the structure denoising process allows us to simplify training by fixing
  the structure prediction network. We further enhance the inverse folding model by
  conditioning it on inferred conformational ensembles to model dynamic RNA conformations.
  Evaluation on protein-conditioned RNA structure and sequence generation tasks demonstrates
  RNAFlow’s advantage over existing RNA design methods.
