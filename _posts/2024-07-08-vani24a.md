title: 'Forget Sharpness: Perturbed Forgetting of Model Biases Within SAM Dynamics'
openreview: cU20finY8V
abstract: Despite attaining high empirical generalization, the sharpness of models
  trained with sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) do not always correlate with generalization
  error. Instead of viewing SAM as minimizing sharpness to improve generalization,
  our paper considers a new perspective based on SAM’s training dynamics. We propose
  that perturbations in SAM perform <em>perturbed forgetting</em>, where they discard
  undesirable model biases to exhibit learning signals that generalize better. We
  relate our notion of forgetting to the information bottleneck principle, use it
  to explain observations like the better generalization of smaller perturbation batches,
  and show that perturbed forgetting can exhibit a stronger correlation with generalization
  than flatness. While standard SAM targets model biases exposed by the steepest ascent
  directions, we propose a new perturbation that targets biases exposed through the
  model’s outputs. Our output bias forgetting perturbations outperform standard SAM,
  GSAM, and ASAM on ImageNet, robustness benchmarks, and transfer to CIFAR-10,100,
  while sometimes converging to sharper regions. Our results suggest that the benefits
  of SAM can be explained by alternative mechanistic principles that do not require
  flatness of the loss surface.
