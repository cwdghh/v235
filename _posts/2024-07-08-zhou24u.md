title: 'Graphon Mean Field Games with a Representative Player: Analysis and Learning
  Algorithm'
openreview: 7C4EQqtb02
abstract: We propose a discrete time graphon game formulation on continuous state
  and action spaces using a representative player to study stochastic games with heterogeneous
  interaction among agents. This formulation admits both conceptual and mathematical
  advantages, compared to a widely adopted formulation using a continuum of players.
  We prove the existence and uniqueness of the graphon equilibrium with mild assumptions,
  and show that this equilibrium can be used to construct an approximate solution
  for the finite player game, which is challenging to analyze and solve due to curse
  of dimensionality. An online oracle-free learning algorithm is developed to solve
  the equilibrium numerically, and sample complexity analysis is provided for its
  convergence.
