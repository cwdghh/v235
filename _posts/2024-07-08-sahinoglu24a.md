title: An Online Optimization Perspective on First-Order and Zero-Order Decentralized
  Nonsmooth Nonconvex Stochastic Optimization
openreview: PSzyBN7LIA
abstract: We investigate the finite-time analysis of finding ($\delta, \epsilon$)-stationary
  points for nonsmooth nonconvex objectives in decentralized stochastic optimization.
  A set of agents aim at minimizing a global function using only their local information
  by interacting over a network. We present a novel algorithm, called Multi Epoch
  Decentralized Online Learning (ME-DOL), for which we establish the sample complexity
  in various settings. First, using a recently proposed online-to-nonconvex technique,
  we show that our algorithm recovers the optimal convergence rate of smooth nonconvex
  objectives. We then extend our analysis to the nonsmooth setting, building on properties
  of randomized smoothing and Goldstein-subdifferential sets. We establish the sample
  complexity of $O(\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-3})$, which to the best of our knowledge
  is the first finite-time guarantee for decentralized nonsmooth nonconvex stochastic
  optimization in the first-order setting (without weak-convexity), matching its optimal
  centralized counterpart. We further prove the same rate for the zero-order oracle
  setting without using variance reduction.
