title: 'WebLINX: Real-World Website Navigation with Multi-Turn Dialogue'
openreview: mUSPhG4uDW
abstract: We propose the problem of conversational web navigation, where a digital
  agent controls a web browser and follows user instructions to solve real-world tasks
  in a multi-turn dialogue fashion. To support this problem, we introduce WEBLINX
  - a large-scale benchmark of 100K interactions across 2300 expert demonstrations
  of conversational web navigation. Our benchmark covers a broad range of patterns
  on over 150 real-world websites and can be used to train and evaluate agents in
  diverse scenarios. Due to the magnitude of information present, Large Language Models
  (LLMs) cannot process entire web pages in real-time. To solve this bottleneck, we
  design a retrieval-inspired model that efficiently prunes HTML pages by ranking
  relevant elements. We use the selected elements, along with screenshots and action
  history, to assess a variety of models for their ability to replicate human behavior
  when navigating the web. Our experiments span from small text-only to proprietary
  multimodal LLMs. We find that smaller finetuned decoders surpass the best zero-shot
  LLMs (including GPT-4V), but also larger finetuned multimodal models which were
  explicitly pretrained on screenshots. However, all finetuned models struggle to
  generalize to unseen websites. Our findings highlight the need for large multimodal
  models that can generalize to novel settings.
