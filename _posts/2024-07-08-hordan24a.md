title: Weisfeiler Leman for Euclidean Equivariant Machine Learning
openreview: ApRKrKZJSk
abstract: 'The $k$-Weisfeiler-Leman ($k$-WL) graph isomorphism test hierarchy is a
  common method for assessing the expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs).
  Recently, GNNs whose expressive power is equivalent to the $2$-WL test were proven
  to be universal on weighted graphs which encode $3\mathrm{D}$ point cloud data,
  yet this result is limited to invariant continuous functions on point clouds. In
  this paper, we extend this result in three ways: Firstly, we show that PPGN can
  simulate $2$-WL uniformly on all point clouds with low complexity. Secondly, we
  show that $2$-WL tests can be extended to point clouds which include both positions
  and velocities, a scenario often encountered in applications. Finally, we provide
  a general framework for proving equivariant universality and leverage it to prove
  that a simple modification of this invariant PPGN architecture can be used to obtain
  a universal equivariant architecture that can approximate all continuous equivariant
  functions uniformly. Building on our results, we develop our WeLNet architecture,
  which sets new state-of-the-art results on the N-Body dynamics task and the GEOM-QM9
  molecular conformation generation task.'
