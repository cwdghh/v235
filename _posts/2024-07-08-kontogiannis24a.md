title: The Computational Complexity of Finding Second-Order Stationary Points
openreview: t8WDBcegae
abstract: Non-convex minimization problems are universally considered hard, and even
  guaranteeing that a computed solution is locally minimizing is known to be NP-hard.
  In this general context, our paper focuses on the problem of finding stationary
  points that satisfy an approximate second-order optimality condition, which serves
  to exclude strict saddles and other non-minimizing stationary points. Our main result
  is that the problem of finding approximate second-order stationary points (SOSPs)
  is PLS-complete, i.e., of the same complexity as the problem of finding first-order
  stationary points (FOSPs), thus resolving an open question in the field. In particular,
  our results imply that, under the widely believed complexity conjecture that PLS
  $\neq$ FNP, finding approximate SOSPs in unconstrained domains is <em>easier</em>
  than in constrained domains, which is known to be NP-hard. This comes in stark contrast
  with earlier results which implied that, unless PLS = CLS, finding approximate FOSPs
  in unconstrained domains is <em>harder</em> than in constrained domains.
