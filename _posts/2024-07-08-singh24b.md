title: Finite Time Logarithmic Regret Bounds for Self-Tuning Regulation
openreview: tTtSnpH4fc
abstract: We establish the first finite-time logarithmic regret bounds for the self-tuning
  regulation problem. We introduce a modified version of the certainty equivalence
  algorithm, which we call PIECE, that clips inputs in addition to utilizing probing
  inputs for exploration. We show that it has a $C \log T$ upper bound on the regret
  after $T$ time-steps for bounded noise, and $C\log^3 T$ in the case of sub-Gaussian
  noise, unlike the LQ problem where logarithmic regret is shown to be not possible.
  The PIECE algorithm is also designed to address the critical challenge of poor initial
  transient performance of reinforcement learning algorithms for linear systems. Comparative
  simulation results illustrate the improved performance of PIECE.
