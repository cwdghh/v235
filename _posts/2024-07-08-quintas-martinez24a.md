title: Multiply-Robust Causal Change Attribution
openreview: n2eppIzHlL
abstract: Comparing two samples of data, we observe a change in the distribution of
  an outcome variable. In the presence of multiple explanatory variables, how much
  of the change can be explained by each possible cause? We develop a new estimation
  strategy that, given a causal model, combines regression and re-weighting methods
  to quantify the contribution of each causal mechanism. Our proposed methodology
  is multiply robust, meaning that it still recovers the target parameter under partial
  misspecification. We prove that our estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal.
  Moreover, it can be incorporated into existing frameworks for causal attribution,
  such as Shapley values, which will inherit the consistency and large-sample distribution
  properties. Our method demonstrates excellent performance in Monte Carlo simulations,
  and we show its usefulness in an empirical application. Our method is implemented
  as part of the Python library “DoWhy“ (Sharma & Kiciman, 2020; Blöbaum et al., 2022).
