title: Transport of Algebraic Structure to Latent Embeddings
openreview: rK6AZem0hX
abstract: Machine learning often aims to produce latent embeddings of inputs which
  lie in a larger, abstract mathematical space. For example, in the field of 3D modeling,
  subsets of Euclidean space can be embedded as vectors using implicit neural representations.
  Such subsets also have a natural algebraic structure including operations (e.g.,
  union) and corresponding laws (e.g., associativity). How can we learn to "union"
  two sets using only their latent embeddings while respecting associativity? We propose
  a general procedure for parameterizing latent space operations that are provably
  consistent with the laws on the input space. This is achieved by learning a bijection
  from the latent space to a carefully designed <em>mirrored algebra</em> which is
  constructed on Euclidean space in accordance with desired laws. We evaluate these
  <em>structural transport nets</em> for a range of mirrored algebras against baselines
  that operate directly on the latent space. Our experiments provide strong evidence
  that respecting the underlying algebraic structure of the input space is key for
  learning accurate and self-consistent operations.
