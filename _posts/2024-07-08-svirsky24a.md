title: Interpretable Deep Clustering for Tabular Data
openreview: QPy7zLfvof
abstract: Clustering is a fundamental learning task widely used as a first step in
  data analysis. For example, biologists use cluster assignments to analyze genome
  sequences, medical records, or images. Since downstream analysis is typically performed
  at the cluster level, practitioners seek reliable and interpretable clustering models.
  We propose a new deep-learning framework for general domain tabular data that predicts
  interpretable cluster assignments at the instance and cluster levels. First, we
  present a self-supervised procedure to identify the subset of the most informative
  features from each data point. Then, we design a model that predicts cluster assignments
  and a gate matrix that provides cluster-level feature selection. Overall, our model
  provides cluster assignments with an indication of the driving feature for each
  sample and each cluster. We show that the proposed method can reliably predict cluster
  assignments in biological, text, image, and physics tabular datasets. Furthermore,
  using previously proposed metrics, we verify that our model leads to interpretable
  results at a sample and cluster level. Our code is available on https://github.com/jsvir/idc.
