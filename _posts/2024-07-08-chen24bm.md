title: On the Trajectory Regularity of ODE-based Diffusion Sampling
openreview: H86WzfH5N1
abstract: Diffusion-based generative models use stochastic differential equations
  (SDEs) and their equivalent ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to establish
  a smooth connection between a complex data distribution and a tractable prior distribution.
  In this paper, we identify several intriguing trajectory properties in the ODE-based
  sampling process of diffusion models. We characterize an implicit denoising trajectory
  and discuss its vital role in forming the coupled sampling trajectory with a strong
  shape regularity, regardless of the generated content. We also describe a dynamic
  programming-based scheme to make the time schedule in sampling better fit the underlying
  trajectory structure. This simple strategy requires minimal modification to any
  given ODE-based numerical solvers and incurs negligible computational cost, while
  delivering superior performance in image generation, especially in $5\sim 10$ function
  evaluations.
