title: Fully-Dynamic Approximate Decision Trees With Worst-Case Update Time Guarantees
openreview: d5tJWH5yCi
abstract: We study the problem of maintaining a decision tree in the fully-dynamic
  setting, where the dataset is updated by an adversarial sequence of insertions and
  deletions. We present the first algorithm with strong guarantees on both the quality
  of the tree and the worst-case update time (the maximum time spent between two consecutive
  dataset updates). For instance, we can maintain a tree where each node has Gini
  gain within $\beta$ of the optimum, while guaranteeing an update time $O(d \beta^{-3}
  \log^4 n )$, where $d$ is the number of features and $n$ the maximum size of the
  dataset. This is optimal up to polylogarithmic factors, as any dynamic algorithm
  must have update time in $\Omega(d)$. Similar guarantees hold for the variance and
  information gain, for classification and regression, and even for <em>boosted</em>
  trees. This shows that many popular decision trees such as ID3 or C4.5 can be efficiently
  be made dynamic, answering an open question of Bressan, Damay and Sozio (AAAI 2023).
  We also show that, under the 3SUM conjecture or the Orthogonal Vectors Hypothesis,
  the update time must be polynomial in $1/\beta$.
