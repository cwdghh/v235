title: 'From Words to Actions: Unveiling the Theoretical Underpinnings of LLM-Driven
  Autonomous Systems'
openreview: qkhbyDqlNI
abstract: In this work, from a theoretical lens, we aim to understand why large language
  model (LLM) empowered agents are able to solve decision-making problems in the physical
  world. To this end, consider a hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) model where
  the LLM Planner and the Actor perform high-level task planning and low-level execution,
  respectively. Under this model, the LLM Planner navigates a partially observable
  Markov decision process (POMDP) by iteratively generating language-based subgoals
  via prompting. Under proper assumptions on the pretraining data, we prove that the
  pretrained LLM Planner effectively performs Bayesian aggregated imitation learning
  (BAIL) through in-context learning. Additionally, we highlight the necessity for
  exploration beyond the subgoals derived from BAIL by proving that naively executing
  the subgoals returned by LLM leads to a linear regret. As a remedy, we introduce
  an $\epsilon$-greedy exploration strategy to BAIL, which is proven to incur sublinear
  regret when the pretraining error is small. Finally, we extend our theoretical framework
  to include scenarios where the LLM Planner serves as a world model for inferring
  the transition model of the environment and to multi-agent settings, enabling coordination
  among multiple Actors.
