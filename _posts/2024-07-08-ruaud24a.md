title: Modelling Microbial Communities with Graph Neural Networks
openreview: vBJZ93tvoE
abstract: Understanding the interactions and interplay of microorganisms is a great
  challenge with many applications in medical and environmental settings. In this
  work, we model bacterial communities directly from their genomes using graph neural
  networks (GNNs). GNNs leverage the inductive bias induced by the set nature of bacteria,
  enforcing permutation invariance and granting combinatorial generalization. We propose
  to learn the dynamics implicitly by directly predicting community relative abundance
  profiles at steady state, thus escaping the need for growth curves. On two real-world
  datasets, we show for the first time generalization to unseen bacteria and different
  community structures. To investigate the prediction results more deeply, we create
  a simulation for flexible data generation and analyze effects of bacteria interaction
  strength, community size, and training data amount.
