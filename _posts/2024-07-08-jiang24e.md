title: Federated Optimization with Doubly Regularized Drift Correction
openreview: JD03zxWZzs
abstract: Federated learning is a distributed optimization paradigm that allows training
  machine learning models across decentralized devices while keeping the data localized.
  The standard method, FedAvg, suffers from client drift which can hamper performance
  and increase communication costs over centralized methods. Previous works proposed
  various strategies to mitigate drift, yet none have shown consistently improved
  communication-computation trade-offs over vanilla gradient descent across all standard
  function classes. In this work, we revisit DANE, an established method in distributed
  optimization. We show that (i) DANE can achieve the desired communication reduction
  under Hessian similarity constraints. Furthermore, (ii) we present an extension,
  DANE+, which supports arbitrary inexact local solvers and has more freedom to choose
  how to aggregate the local updates. We propose (iii) a novel method, FedRed, which
  has improved local computational complexity and retains the same communication complexity
  compared to DANE/DANE+. This is achieved by doubly regularized drift correction.
