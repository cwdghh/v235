title: All-in-one simulation-based inference
openreview: DL79HYCFFq
abstract: 'Amortized Bayesian inference trains neural networks to solve stochastic
  inference problems using model simulations, thereby making it possible to rapidly
  perform Bayesian inference for any newly observed data. However, current simulation-based
  amortized inference methods are simulation-hungry and inflexible: They require the
  specification of a fixed parametric prior, simulator, and inference tasks ahead
  of time. Here, we present a new amortized inference method—the Simformer—which overcomes
  these limitations. By training a probabilistic diffusion model with transformer
  architectures, the Simformer outperforms current state-of-the-art amortized inference
  approaches on benchmark tasks and is substantially more flexible: It can be applied
  to models with function-valued parameters, it can handle inference scenarios with
  missing or unstructured data, and it can sample arbitrary conditionals of the joint
  distribution of parameters and data, including both posterior and likelihood. We
  showcase the performance and flexibility of the Simformer on simulators from ecology,
  epidemiology, and neuroscience, and demonstrate that it opens up new possibilities
  and application domains for amortized Bayesian inference on simulation-based models.'
