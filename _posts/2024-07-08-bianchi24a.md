title: How Well Can LLMs Negotiate? NegotiationArena Platform and Analysis
openreview: CmOmaxkt8p
abstract: 'Negotiation is the basis of social interactions; humans negotiate everything
  from the price of cars to how to share common resources. With rapidly growing interest
  in using large language models (LLMs) to act as agents on behalf of human users,
  such LLM agents would also need to be able to negotiate. In this paper, we study
  how well LLMs can negotiate with each other. We develop NegotiationArena: a flexible
  framework for evaluating and probing the negotiation abilities of LLM agents. We
  implemented three types of scenarios in NegotiationArena to assess LLM’s behaviors
  in allocating shared resources (ultimatum games), aggregate resources (trading games)
  and buy/sell goods (price negotiations). Each scenario allows for multiple turns
  of flexible dialogues between LLM agents to allow for more complex negotiations.
  Interestingly, LLM agents can significantly boost their negotiation outcomes by
  employing certain behavioral tactics. For example, by pretending to be desolate
  and desperate, LLMs can improve their payoffs by 20% when negotiating against the
  standard GPT-4. We also quantify irrational negotiation behaviors exhibited by the
  LLM agents, many of which also appear in humans. Together, NegotiationArena offers
  a new environment to investigate LLM interactions, enabling new insights into LLM’s
  theory of mind, irrationality, and reasoning abilities'
