title: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention
openreview: jQ92egz5Ym
abstract: 'The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to
  obtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained hardware.
  However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade and even fail
  to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a novel IR-QLoRA for
  pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate through information retention.
  The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two technologies derived from the perspective
  of unified information: (1) statistics-based Information Calibration Quantization
  allows the quantized parameters of LLM to retain original information accurately;
  (2) finetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic
  representation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive experiments
  show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA and LLaMA2 families
  under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4-bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4% improvement on MMLU compared
  with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant performance gain requires only
  a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption, revealing the satisfactory efficiency
  of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that IR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible
  with various frameworks (e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings
  general accuracy gains. The code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora
