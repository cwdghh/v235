title: 'Second-Order Uncertainty Quantification: A Distance-Based Approach'
openreview: VJjjNrUi8j
abstract: In the past couple of years, various approaches to representing and quantifying
  different types of predictive uncertainty in machine learning, notably in the setting
  of classification, have been proposed on the basis of second-order probability distributions,
  i.e., predictions in the form of distributions on probability distributions. A completely
  conclusive solution has not yet been found, however, as shown by recent criticisms
  of commonly used uncertainty measures associated with second-order distributions,
  identifying undesirable theoretical properties of these measures. In light of these
  criticisms, we propose a set of formal criteria that meaningful uncertainty measures
  for predictive uncertainty based on second-order distributions should obey. Moreover,
  we provide a general framework for developing uncertainty measures to account for
  these criteria, and offer an instantiation based on the Wasserstein distance, for
  which we prove that all criteria are satisfied.
