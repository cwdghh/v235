title: Trustworthy Alignment of Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models via Reinforcement
  Learning
openreview: XwnABAdH5y
abstract: Trustworthiness is an essential prerequisite for the real-world application
  of large language models. In this paper, we focus on the trustworthiness of language
  models with respect to retrieval augmentation. Despite being supported with external
  evidence, retrieval-augmented generation still suffers from hallucinations, one
  primary cause of which is the conflict between contextual and parametric knowledge.
  We deem that retrieval-augmented language models have the inherent capabilities
  of supplying response according to both contextual and parametric knowledge. Inspired
  by aligning language models with human preference, we take the first step towards
  aligning retrieval-augmented language models to a status where it responds relying
  merely on the external evidence and disregards the interference of parametric knowledge.
  Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning based algorithm Trustworthy-Alignment,
  theoretically and experimentally demonstrating large language modelsâ€™ capability
  of reaching a trustworthy status without explicit supervision on how to respond.
  Our work highlights the potential of large language models on exploring its intrinsic
  abilities by its own and expands the application scenarios of alignment from fulfilling
  human preference to creating trustworthy agents.
