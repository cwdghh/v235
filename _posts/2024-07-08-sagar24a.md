title: 'Failures Are Fated, But Can Be Faded: Characterizing and Mitigating Unwanted
  Behaviors in Large-Scale Vision and Language Models'
openreview: DkqiId4AuR
abstract: In large deep neural networks that seem to perform surprisingly well on
  many tasks, we also observe a few failures related to accuracy, social biases, and
  alignment with human values, among others. Therefore, before deploying these models,
  it is crucial to characterize this failure landscape for engineers to debug and
  legislative bodies to audit models. Nevertheless, it is infeasible to exhaustively
  test for all possible combinations of factors that could lead to a modelâ€™s failure.
  In this paper, we introduce a post-hoc method that utilizes <em>deep reinforcement
  learning</em> to explore and construct the landscape of failure modes in pre-trained
  discriminative and generative models. With the aid of limited human feedback, we
  then demonstrate how to restructure the failure landscape to be more desirable by
  moving away from the discovered failure modes. We empirically show the effectiveness
  of the proposed method across common Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing,
  and Vision-Language tasks.
