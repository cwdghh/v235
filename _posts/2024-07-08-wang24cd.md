title: Quality-Diversity with Limited Resources
openreview: 64I29YeQdt
abstract: 'Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms have emerged as a powerful optimization
  paradigm with the aim of generating a set of high-quality and diverse solutions.
  To achieve such a challenging goal, QD algorithms require maintaining a large archive
  and a large population in each iteration, which brings two main issues, sample and
  resource efficiency. Most advanced QD algorithms focus on improving the sample efficiency,
  while the resource efficiency is overlooked to some extent. Particularly, the resource
  overhead during the training process has not been touched yet, hindering the wider
  application of QD algorithms. In this paper, we highlight this important research
  question, i.e., how to efficiently train QD algorithms with limited resources, and
  propose a novel and effective method called RefQD to address it. RefQD decomposes
  a neural network into representation and decision parts, and shares the representation
  part with all decision parts in the archive to reduce the resource overhead. It
  also employs a series of strategies to address the mismatch issue between the old
  decision parts and the newly updated representation part. Experiments on different
  types of tasks from small to large resource consumption demonstrate the excellent
  performance of RefQD: it not only uses significantly fewer resources (e.g., 16%
  GPU memories on QDax and 3.7% on Atari) but also achieves comparable or better performance
  compared to sample-efficient QD algorithms. Our code is available at https://github.com/lamda-bbo/RefQD.'
