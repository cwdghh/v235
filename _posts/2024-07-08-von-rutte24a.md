title: A Language Model’s Guide Through Latent Space
openreview: c0LoolDFw4
abstract: Concept guidance has emerged as a cheap and simple way to control the behavior
  of language models by probing their hidden representations for concept vectors and
  using them to perturb activations at inference time. While the focus of previous
  work has largely been on <em>truthfulness</em>, in this paper we extend this framework
  to a richer set of concepts such as <em>appropriateness</em>, <em>humor</em>, <em>creativity</em>
  and <em>quality</em>, and explore to what degree current detection and guidance
  strategies work in these challenging settings. To facilitate evaluation, we develop
  a novel metric for concept guidance that takes into account both the success of
  concept elicitation as well as the potential degradation in fluency of the guided
  model. Our extensive experiments reveal that while some concepts such as <em>truthfulness</em>
  more easily allow for guidance with current techniques, novel concepts such as <em>appropriateness</em>
  or <em>humor</em> either remain difficult to elicit, need extensive tuning to work,
  or even experience confusion. Moreover, we find that probes with optimal detection
  accuracies do not necessarily make for the optimal guides, contradicting previous
  observations for <em>truthfulness</em>. Our work warrants a deeper investigation
  into the interplay between detectability, guidability, and the nature of the concept,
  and we hope that our rich experimental test-bed for guidance research inspires stronger
  follow-up approaches.
