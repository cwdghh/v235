title: Aligned Objective for Soft-Pseudo-Label Generation in Supervised Learning
openreview: 1wzdf6NjHd
abstract: Soft pseudo-labels, generated by the softmax predictions of the trained
  networks, offer a probabilistic rather than binary form, and have been shown to
  improve the performance of deep neural networks in supervised learning. Most previous
  methods adopt classification loss to train a classifier as the soft-pseudo-label
  generator and fail to fully exploit their potential due to the misalignment with
  the target of soft-pseudo-label generation, aimed at capturing the knowledge in
  the data rather than making definitive classifications. Nevertheless, manually designing
  an effective objective function for a soft-pseudo-label generator is challenging,
  primarily because datasets typically lack ground-truth soft labels, complicating
  the evaluation of the soft pseudo-label accuracy. To deal with this problem, we
  propose a novel framework that alternately trains the predictive model and the soft-pseudo-label
  generator guided by a meta-network-parameterized objective function. The parameters
  of the objective function are optimized based on the feedback from both the performance
  of the predictive model and the soft-pseudo-label generator in the learning task.
  Additionally, the framework offers versatility across different learning tasks by
  allowing direct modifications to the task loss. Experiments on the benchmark datasets
  validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
