title: 'STEER: Assessing the Economic Rationality of Large Language Models'
openreview: nU1mtFDtMX
abstract: 'There is increasing interest in using LLMs as decision-making "agents".
  Doing so includes many degrees of freedom: which model should be used; how should
  it be prompted; should it be asked to introspect, conduct chain-of-thought reasoning,
  etc? Settling these questions—and more broadly, determining whether an LLM agent
  is reliable enough to be trusted—requires a methodology for assessing such an agent’s
  economic rationality. In this paper, we provide one. We begin by surveying the economic
  literature on rational decision making, taxonomizing a large set of fine-grained
  "elements" that an agent should exhibit, along with dependencies between them. We
  then propose a benchmark distribution that quantitatively scores an LLMs performance
  on these elements and, combined with a user-provided rubric, produces a "rationality
  report card". Finally, we describe the results of a large-scale empirical experiment
  with 14 different LLMs, characterizing the both current state of the art and the
  impact of different model sizes on models’ ability to exhibit rational behavior.'
