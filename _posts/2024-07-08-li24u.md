title: Vague Prototype-Oriented Diffusion Model for Multi-Class Anomaly Detection
openreview: FvLd8Gr7xq
abstract: Multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection aims to create a unified model
  for identifying anomalies in objects from multiple classes when only normal data
  is available. In such a challenging setting, widely used reconstruction-based networks
  persistently grapple with the "identical shortcut" problem, wherein the infiltration
  of abnormal information from the condition biases the output towards an anomalous
  distribution. In response to this critical challenge, we introduce a Vague Prototype-Oriented
  Diffusion Model (VPDM) that extracts only fundamental information from the condition
  to prevent the occurrence of the "identical shortcut" problem from the input layer.
  This model leverages prototypes that contain only vague information about the target
  as the initial condition. Subsequently, a novel conditional diffusion model is introduced
  to incrementally enhance details based on vague conditions. Finally, a Vague Prototype-Oriented
  Optimal Transport (VPOT) method is proposed to provide more accurate information
  about conditions. All these components are seamlessly integrated into a unified
  optimization objective. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated across
  diverse datasets, including the MVTec, VisA, and MPDD benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art
  results.
