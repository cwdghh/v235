title: 'Pruner-Zero: Evolving Symbolic Pruning Metric From Scratch for Large Language
  Models'
openreview: 1tRLxQzdep
abstract: 'Despite the remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) face
  deployment challenges due to their extensive size. Pruning methods drop a subset
  of weights to accelerate, but many of them require retraining, which is prohibitively
  expensive and computationally demanding. Recently, post-training pruning approaches
  introduced novel metrics, enabling the pruning of LLMs without retraining. However,
  these metrics require the involvement of human experts and tedious trial and error.
  To efficiently identify superior pruning metrics, we develop an automatic framework
  for searching symbolic pruning metrics using genetic programming. In particular,
  we devise an elaborate search space encompassing the existing pruning metrics to
  discover the potential symbolic pruning metric. We propose an opposing operation
  simplification strategy to increase the diversity of the population. In this way,
  Pruner-Zero allows auto-generation of symbolic pruning metrics. Based on the searched
  results, we explore the correlation between pruning metrics and performance after
  pruning and summarize some principles. Extensive experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA-2
  on language modeling and zero-shot tasks demonstrate that our Pruner-Zero obtains
  superior performance than SOTA post-training pruning methods. Code at: https://github.com/pprp/Pruner-Zero.'
