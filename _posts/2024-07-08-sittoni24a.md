title: Subhomogeneous Deep Equilibrium Models
openreview: YBXwr7wF7i
abstract: Implicit-depth neural networks have grown as powerful alternatives to traditional
  networks in various applications in recent years. However, these models often lack
  guarantees of existence and uniqueness, raising stability, performance, and reproducibility
  issues. In this paper, we present a new analysis of the existence and uniqueness
  of fixed points for implicit-depth neural networks based on the concept of subhomogeneous
  operators and the nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory. Compared to previous similar
  analyses, our theory allows for weaker assumptions on the parameter matrices, thus
  yielding a more flexible framework for well-defined implicit networks. We illustrate
  the performance of the resulting subhomogeneous networks on feedforward, convolutional,
  and graph neural network examples
