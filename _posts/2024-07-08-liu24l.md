title: 'ESNet: Evolution and Succession Network for High-Resolution Salient Object
  Detection'
openreview: SERrqPDvoY
abstract: Preserving details and avoiding high computational costs are the two main
  challenges for the High-Resolution Salient Object Detection (HRSOD) task. In this
  paper, we propose a two-stage HRSOD model from the perspective of evolution and
  succession, including an evolution stage with Low-resolution Location Model (LrLM)
  and a succession stage with High-resolution Refinement Model (HrRM). The evolution
  stage achieves detail-preserving salient objects localization on the low-resolution
  image through the evolution mechanisms on supervision and feature; the succession
  stage utilizes the shallow high-resolution features to complement and enhance the
  features inherited from the first stage in a lightweight manner and generate the
  final high-resolution saliency prediction. Besides, a new metric named Boundary-Detail-aware
  Mean Absolute Error (${MAE}_{{BD}}$) is designed to evaluate the ability to detect
  details in high-resolution scenes. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate
  that our network achieves superior performance at real-time speed (49 FPS) compared
  to state-of-the-art methods.
