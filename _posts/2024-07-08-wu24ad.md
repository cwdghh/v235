title: Unraveling the Impact of Heterophilic Structures on Graph Positive-Unlabeled
  Learning
openreview: NCT3w7VKjo
abstract: While Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning is vital in many real-world scenarios,
  its application to graph data still remains under-explored. We unveil that a critical
  challenge for PU learning on graph lies on the edge heterophily, which directly
  violates the $\textit{irreducibility assumption}$ for $\textit{Class-Prior Estimation}$
  (class prior is essential for building PU learning algorithms) and degenerates the
  latent label inference on unlabeled nodes during classifier training. In response
  to this challenge, we introduce a new method, named $\textit{$\underline{G}$raph
  $\underline{P}$U Learning with $\underline{L}$abel Propagation Loss}$ (GPL). Specifically,
  GPL considers learning from PU nodes along with an intermediate heterophily reduction,
  which helps mitigate the negative impact of the heterophilic structure. We formulate
  this procedure as a bilevel optimization that reduces heterophily in the inner loop
  and efficiently learns a classifier in the outer loop. Extensive experiments across
  a variety of datasets have shown that GPL significantly outperforms baseline methods,
  confirming its effectiveness and superiority.
