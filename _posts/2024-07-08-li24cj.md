title: 'Seesaw: Compensating for Nonlinear Reduction with Linear Computations for
  Private Inference'
openreview: jklD0TV5Hw
abstract: With increasingly serious data privacy concerns and strict regulations,
  privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) has emerged to securely execute machine
  learning tasks without violating privacy. Unfortunately, the computational cost
  to securely execute nonlinear computations in PPML remains significant, calling
  for new model architecture designs with fewer nonlinear operations. We propose Seesaw,
  a novel neural architecture search method tailored for PPML. Seesaw exploits a previously
  unexplored opportunity to leverage more linear computations and nonlinear result
  reuse, in order to compensate for the accuracy loss due to nonlinear reduction.
  It incorporates specifically designed pruning and search strategies, not only to
  efficiently handle the much larger design space of both linear and nonlinear operators,
  but also to achieve a better balance between the model accuracy and the online/offline
  execution latencies. Compared to the state-of-the-art design for image classification
  on ImageNet, Seesaw achieves 1.68$\times$ lower online latency and 1.55$\times$
  lower total online + offline latency at 71% iso-accuracy, or 3.65% higher accuracy
  at iso-latency of 190 seconds, while using much simpler and faster search and training
  methods.
