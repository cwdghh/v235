title: 'SPP: Sparsity-Preserved Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for Large Language
  Models'
openreview: 9Rroj9GIOQ
abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become pivotal in advancing the field
  of artificial intelligence, yet their immense sizes pose significant challenges
  for both fine-tuning and deployment. Current post-training pruning methods, while
  reducing the sizes of LLMs, often fail to maintain their original performance. To
  address these challenges, this paper introduces SPP, a <b>S</b>parsity-<b>P</b>reserved
  <b>P</b>arameter-efficient fine-tuning method. Different from existing post-training
  pruning approaches that struggle with performance retention, SPP proposes to employ
  lightweight learnable column and row matrices to optimize sparse LLM weights, <em>keeping
  the structure and sparsity of pruned pre-trained models intact</em>. By element-wise
  multiplication and residual addition, SPP ensures the consistency of model sparsity
  pattern and ratio during both training and weight-merging processes. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of SPP by applying it to the LLaMA and LLaMA-2 model families
  with recent post-training pruning methods. Our results show that SPP significantly
  enhances the performance of models with different sparsity patterns (i.e. unstructured
  and N:M sparsity), especially for those with high sparsity ratios (e.g. 75%), making
  it a promising solution for the efficient fine-tuning of sparse LLMs. Code will
  be made available at https://github.com/Lucky-Lance/SPP.
