title: Probabilistic Generating Circuits - Demystified
openreview: EqFxIbGWRU
abstract: 'Zhang et al. (ICML 2021, PLMR 139, pp. 12447–12457) introduced probabilistic
  generating circuits (PGCs) as a probabilistic model to unify probabilistic circuits
  (PCs) and determinantal point processes (DPPs). At a first glance, PGCs store a
  distribution in a very different way, they compute the probability generating polynomial
  instead of the probability mass function and it seems that this is the main reason
  why PGCs are more powerful than PCs or DPPs. However, PGCs also allow for negative
  weights, whereas classical PCs assume that all weights are nonnegative. One main
  insight of this work is that the negative weights are the cause for the power of
  PGCs and not the different representation. PGCs are PCs in disguise: we show how
  to transform any PGC on binary variables into a PC with negative weights with only
  polynomial blowup. PGCs were defined by Zhang et al. only for binary random variables.
  As our second main result, we show that there is a good reason for this: we prove
  that PGCs for categorical variables with larger image size do not support tractable
  marginalization unless NP=P. On the other hand, we show that we can model categorical
  variables with larger image size as PC with negative weights computing set-multilinear
  polynomials. These allow for tractable marginalization. In this sense, PCs with
  negative weights strictly subsume PGCs.'
