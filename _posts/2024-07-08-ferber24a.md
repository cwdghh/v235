title: 'GenCO: Generating Diverse Designs with Combinatorial Constraints'
openreview: DiyE6OOGBa
abstract: Deep generative models like GAN and VAE have shown impressive results in
  generating unconstrained objects like images. However, many design settings arising
  in industrial design, material science, computer graphics and more require that
  the generated objects satisfy hard combinatorial constraints or meet objectives
  in addition to modeling a data distribution. To address this, we propose GenCO,
  a generative framework that guarantees constraint satisfaction throughout training
  by leveraging differentiable combinatorial solvers to enforce feasibility. GenCO
  imposes the generative loss on provably feasible solutions rather than intermediate
  soft solutions, meaning that the deep generative network can focus on ensuring the
  generated objects match the data distribution without having to also capture feasibility.
  This shift enables practitioners to enforce hard constraints on the generated outputs
  during end-to-end training, enabling assessments of their feasibility and introducing
  additional combinatorial loss components to deep generative training. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of generative combinatorial tasks,
  including game level generation, map creation for path planning, and photonic device
  design, consistently demonstrating its capability to yield diverse, high-quality
  solutions that verifiably adhere to user-specified combinatorial properties.
