title: 'Position: Leverage Foundational Models for Black-Box Optimization'
openreview: ea2MgKn3sV
abstract: Undeniably, Large Language Models (LLMs) have stirred an extraordinary wave
  of innovation in the machine learning research domain, resulting in substantial
  impact across diverse fields such as reinforcement learning, robotics, and computer
  vision. Their incorporation has been rapid and transformative, marking a significant
  paradigm shift in the field of machine learning research. However, the field of
  experimental design, grounded on black-box optimization, has been much less affected
  by such a paradigm shift, even though integrating LLMs with optimization presents
  a unique landscape ripe for exploration. In this position paper, we frame the field
  of black-box optimization around sequence-based foundation models and organize their
  relationship with previous literature. We discuss the most promising ways foundational
  language models can revolutionize optimization, which include harnessing the vast
  wealth of information encapsulated in free-form text to enrich task comprehension,
  utilizing highly flexible sequence models such as Transformers to engineer superior
  optimization strategies, and enhancing performance prediction over previously unseen
  search spaces.
