title: Consistent Submodular Maximization
openreview: AlJkqMnyjL
abstract: 'Maximizing monotone submodular functions under cardinality constraints
  is a classic optimization task with several applications in data mining and machine
  learning. In this paper, we study this problem in a dynamic environment with consistency
  constraints: elements arrive in a streaming fashion, and the goal is maintaining
  a constant approximation to the optimal solution while having a stable solution
  (i.e., the number of changes between two consecutive solutions is bounded). In this
  setting, we provide algorithms with different trade-offs between consistency and
  approximation quality. We also complement our theoretical results with an experimental
  analysis showing the effectiveness of our algorithms in real-world instances.'
