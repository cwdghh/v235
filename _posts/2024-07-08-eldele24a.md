title: 'TSLANet: Rethinking Transformers for Time Series Representation Learning'
openreview: CGR3vpX63X
abstract: Time series data, characterized by its intrinsic long and short-range dependencies,
  poses a unique challenge across analytical applications. While Transformer-based
  models excel at capturing long-range dependencies, they face limitations in noise
  sensitivity, computational efficiency, and overfitting with smaller datasets. In
  response, we introduce a novel <b>T</b>ime <b>S</b>eries <b>L</b>ightweight <b>A</b>daptive
  <b>Net</b>work (<b>TSLANet</b>), as a universal convolutional model for diverse
  time series tasks. Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Spectral Block, harnessing
  Fourier analysis to enhance feature representation and to capture both long-term
  and short-term interactions while mitigating noise via adaptive thresholding. Additionally,
  we introduce an Interactive Convolution Block and leverage self-supervised learning
  to refine the capacity of TSLANet for decoding complex temporal patterns and improve
  its robustness on different datasets. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate
  that TSLANet outperforms state-of-the-art models in various tasks spanning classification,
  forecasting, and anomaly detection, showcasing its resilience and adaptability across
  a spectrum of noise levels and data sizes. The code is available at https://github.com/emadeldeen24/TSLANet.
