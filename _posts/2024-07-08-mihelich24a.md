title: 'Interplay of ROC and Precision-Recall AUCs: Theoretical Limits and Practical
  Implications in Binary Classification'
openreview: ALc7DmOTI2
abstract: In this paper, we present two key theorems that should have significant
  implications for machine learning practitioners working with binary classification
  models. The first theorem provides a formula to calculate the maximum and minimum
  Precision-Recall AUC ($AUC_{PR}$) for a fixed Receiver Operating Characteristic
  AUC ($AUC_{ROC}$), demonstrating the variability of $AUC_{PR}$ even with a high
  $AUC_{ROC}$. This is particularly relevant for imbalanced datasets, where a good
  $AUC_{ROC}$ does not necessarily imply a high $AUC_{PR}$. The second theorem inversely
  establishes the bounds of $AUC_{ROC}$ given a fixed $AUC_{PR}$. Our findings highlight
  that in certain situations, especially for imbalanced datasets, it is more informative
  to prioritize $AUC_{PR}$ over $AUC_{ROC}$. Additionally, we introduce a method to
  determine when a higher $AUC_{ROC}$ in one model implies a higher $AUC_{PR}$ in
  another and vice versa, streamlining the model evaluation process.
