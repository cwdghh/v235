title: 'Off-policy Evaluation Beyond Overlap: Sharp Partial Identification Under Smoothness'
openreview: oiY7yhyi6W
abstract: Off-policy evaluation, and the complementary problem of policy learning,
  use historical data collected under a logging policy to estimate and/or optimize
  the value of a target policy. Methods for these tasks typically assume overlap between
  the target and logging policy, enabling solutions based on importance weighting
  and/or imputation. Absent such an overlap assumption, existing work either relies
  on a well-specified model or optimizes needlessly conservative bounds. In this work,
  we develop methods for no-overlap policy evaluation without a well-specified model,
  relying instead on non-parametric assumptions on the expected outcome, with a particular
  focus on Lipschitz smoothness. Under such assumptions we are able to provide sharp
  bounds on the off-policy value, along with optimal estimators of those bounds. For
  Lipschitz smoothness, we construct a pair of linear programs that upper and lower
  bound the contribution of the no-overlap region to the off-policy value. We show
  that these programs have a concise closed form solution, and that their solutions
  converge under the Lipschitz assumption to the sharp partial identification bounds
  at a minimax optimal rate, up to log factors. We demonstrate the effectiveness our
  methods on two semi-synthetic examples, and obtain informative and valid bounds
  that are tighter than those possible without smoothness assumptions.
