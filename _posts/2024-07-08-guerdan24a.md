title: Predictive Performance Comparison of Decision Policies Under Confounding
openreview: HrzQZXzrN2
abstract: Predictive models are often introduced to decision-making tasks under the
  rationale that they improve performance over an existing decision-making policy.
  However, it is challenging to compare predictive performance against an existing
  decision-making policy that is generally under-specified and dependent on unobservable
  factors. These sources of uncertainty are often addressed in practice by making
  strong assumptions about the data-generating mechanism. In this work, we propose
  a method to compare the predictive performance of decision policies under a variety
  of modern identification approaches from the causal inference and off-policy evaluation
  literatures (e.g., instrumental variable, marginal sensitivity model, proximal variable).
  Key to our method is the insight that there are regions of uncertainty that we can
  safely ignore in the policy comparison. We develop a practical approach for finite-sample
  estimation of regret intervals under no assumptions on the parametric form of the
  status quo policy. We verify our framework theoretically and via synthetic data
  experiments. We conclude with a real-world application using our framework to support
  a pre-deployment evaluation of a proposed modification to a healthcare enrollment
  policy.
