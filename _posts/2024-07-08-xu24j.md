title: Equivariant Graph Neural Operator for Modeling 3D Dynamics
openreview: dccRCYmL5x
abstract: Modeling the complex three-dimensional (3D) dynamics of relational systems
  is an important problem in the natural sciences, with applications ranging from
  molecular simulations to particle mechanics. Machine learning methods have achieved
  good success by learning graph neural networks to model spatial interactions. However,
  these approaches do not faithfully capture temporal correlations since they only
  model next-step predictions. In this work, we propose Equivariant Graph Neural Operator
  (EGNO), a novel and principled method that directly models dynamics as trajectories
  instead of just next-step prediction. Different from existing methods, EGNO explicitly
  learns the temporal evolution of 3D dynamics where we formulate the dynamics as
  a function over time and learn neural operators to approximate it. To capture the
  temporal correlations while keeping the intrinsic SE(3)-equivariance, we develop
  equivariant temporal convolutions parameterized in the Fourier space and build EGNO
  by stacking the Fourier layers over equivariant networks. EGNO is the first operator
  learning framework that is capable of modeling solution dynamics functions over
  time while retaining 3D equivariance. Comprehensive experiments in multiple domains,
  including particle simulations, human motion capture, and molecular dynamics, demonstrate
  the significantly superior performance of EGNO against existing methods, thanks
  to the equivariant temporal modeling. Our code is available at https://github.com/MinkaiXu/egno.
