title: 'RoboDreamer: Learning Compositional World Models for Robot Imagination'
openreview: kHjOmAUfVe
abstract: Text-to-video models have demonstrated substantial potential in robotic
  decision-making, enabling the imagination of realistic plans of future actions as
  well as accurate environment simulation. However, one major issue in such models
  is generalization â€“ models are limited to synthesizing videos subject to language
  instructions similar to those seen at training time. This is heavily limiting in
  decision-making, where we seek a powerful world model to synthesize plans of unseen
  combinations of objects and actions in order to solve previously unseen tasks in
  new environments. To resolve this issue, we introduce RoboDreamer, an innovative
  approach for learning a compositional world model by factorizing the video generation.
  We leverage the natural compositionality of language to parse instructions into
  a set of lower-level primitives, which we condition a set of models on to generate
  videos. We illustrate how this factorization naturally enables compositional generalization,
  by allowing us to formulate a new natural language instruction as a combination
  of previously seen components. We further show how such a factorization enables
  us to add additional multimodal goals, allowing us to specify a video we wish to
  generate given both natural language instructions and a goal image. Our approach
  can successfully synthesize video plans on unseen goals in the RT-X, enables successful
  robot execution in simulation, and substantially outperforms monolithic baseline
  approaches to video generation.
