title: Non-clairvoyant Scheduling with Partial Predictions
openreview: jJLcXGB2uA
abstract: The non-clairvoyant scheduling problem has gained new interest within learning-augmented
  algorithms, where the decision-maker is equipped with predictions without any quality
  guarantees. In practical settings, access to predictions may be reduced to specific
  instances, due to cost or data limitations. Our investigation focuses on scenarios
  where predictions for only $B$ job sizes out of $n$ are available to the algorithm.
  We first establish near-optimal lower bounds and algorithms in the case of perfect
  predictions. Subsequently, we present a learning-augmented algorithm satisfying
  the robustness, consistency, and smoothness criteria, and revealing a novel tradeoff
  between consistency and smoothness inherent in the scenario with a restricted number
  of predictions.
