title: Neuroexplicit Diffusion Models for Inpainting of Optical Flow Fields
openreview: 3FKEtlX4aM
abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized the field of computer vision by introducing
  large scale neural networks with millions of parameters. Training these networks
  requires massive datasets and leads to intransparent models that can fail to generalize.
  At the other extreme, models designed from partial differential equations (PDEs)
  embed specialized domain knowledge into mathematical equations and usually rely
  on few manually chosen hyperparameters. This makes them transparent by construction
  and if designed and calibrated carefully, they can generalize well to unseen scenarios.
  In this paper, we show how to bring model- and data-driven approaches together by
  combining the explicit PDE-based approaches with convolutional neural networks to
  obtain the best of both worlds. We illustrate a joint architecture for the task
  of inpainting optical flow fields and show that the combination of model- and data-driven
  modeling leads to an effective architecture. Our model outperforms both fully explicit
  and fully data-driven baselines in terms of reconstruction quality, robustness and
  amount of required training data. Averaging the endpoint error across different
  mask densities, our method outperforms the explicit baselines by 11-27%, the GAN
  baseline by 47% and the Probabilisitic Diffusion baseline by 42%. With that, our
  method sets a new state of the art for inpainting of optical flow fields from random
  masks.
