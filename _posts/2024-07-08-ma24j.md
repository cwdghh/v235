title: Differentiable Distributionally Robust Optimization Layers
openreview: HUJK9dFOW6
abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing research interest in decision-focused
  learning, which embeds optimization problems as a layer in learning pipelines and
  demonstrates a superior performance than the prediction-focused approach. However,
  for distributionally robust optimization (DRO), a popular paradigm for decision-making
  under uncertainty, it is still unknown how to embed it as a layer, i.e., how to
  differentiate decisions with respect to an ambiguity set. In this paper, we develop
  such differentiable DRO layers for generic mixed-integer DRO problems with parameterized
  second-order conic ambiguity sets and discuss its extension to Wasserstein ambiguity
  sets. To differentiate the mixed-integer decisions, we propose a novel dual-view
  methodology by handling continuous and discrete parts of decisions via different
  principles. Specifically, we construct a differentiable energy-based surrogate to
  implement the dual-view methodology and use importance sampling to estimate its
  gradient. We further prove that such a surrogate enjoys the asymptotic convergency
  under regularization. As an application of the proposed differentiable DRO layers,
  we develop a novel decision-focused learning pipeline for contextual distributionally
  robust decision-making tasks and compare it with the prediction-focused approach
