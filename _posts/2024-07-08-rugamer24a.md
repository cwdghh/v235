title: Generalizing Orthogonalization for Models with Non-Linearities
openreview: p9SMltcfsu
abstract: The complexity of black-box algorithms can lead to various challenges, including
  the introduction of biases. These biases present immediate risks in the algorithms’
  application. It was, for instance, shown that neural networks can deduce racial
  information solely from a patient’s X-ray scan, a task beyond the capability of
  medical experts. If this fact is not known to the medical expert, automatic decision-making
  based on this algorithm could lead to prescribing a treatment (purely) based on
  racial information. While current methodologies allow for the "orthogonalization"
  or "normalization" of neural networks with respect to such information, existing
  approaches are grounded in linear models. Our paper advances the discourse by introducing
  corrections for non-linearities such as ReLU activations. Our approach also encompasses
  scalar and tensor-valued predictions, facilitating its integration into neural network
  architectures. Through extensive experiments, we validate our method’s effectiveness
  in safeguarding sensitive data in generalized linear models, normalizing convolutional
  neural networks for metadata, and rectifying pre-existing embeddings for undesired
  attributes.
