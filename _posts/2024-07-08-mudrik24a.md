title: 'SiBBlInGS: Similarity-driven Building-Block Inference using Graphs across
  States'
openreview: h8aTi32tul
abstract: Time series data across scientific domains are often collected under distinct
  states (e.g., tasks), wherein latent processes (e.g., biological factors) create
  complex inter- and intra-state variability. A key approach to capture this complexity
  is to uncover fundamental interpretable units within the data, Building Blocks (BBs),
  which modulate their activity and adjust their structure across observations. Existing
  methods for identifying BBs in multi-way data often overlook inter- vs. intra-state
  variability, produce uninterpretable components, or do not align with properties
  of real-world data, such as missing samples and sessions of different duration.
  Here, we present a framework for Similarity-driven Building Block Inference using
  Graphs across States (SiBBlInGS). SiBBlInGS offers a graph-based dictionary learning
  approach for discovering sparse BBs along with their temporal traces, based on co-activity
  patterns and inter- vs. intra-state relationships. Moreover, SiBBlInGS captures
  per-trial temporal variability and controlled cross-state structural BB adaptations,
  identifies state-specific vs. state-invariant components, and accommodates variability
  in the number and duration of observed sessions across states. We demonstrate SiBBlInGSâ€™s
  ability to reveal insights into complex phenomena as well as its robustness to noise
  and missing samples through several synthetic and real-world examples, including
  web search and neural data.
