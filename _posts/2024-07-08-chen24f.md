title: 'MaSS: Multi-attribute Selective Suppression for Utility-preserving Data Transformation
  from an Information-theoretic Perspective'
openreview: 61RlaY9EIn
abstract: The growing richness of large-scale datasets has been crucial in driving
  the rapid advancement and wide adoption of machine learning technologies. The massive
  collection and usage of data, however, pose an increasing risk for peopleâ€™s private
  and sensitive information due to either inadvertent mishandling or malicious exploitation.
  Besides legislative solutions, many technical approaches have been proposed towards
  data privacy protection. However, they bear various limitations such as leading
  to degraded data availability and utility, or relying on heuristics and lacking
  solid theoretical bases. To overcome these limitations, we propose a formal information-theoretic
  definition for this utility-preserving privacy protection problem, and design a
  data-driven learnable data transformation framework that is capable of selectively
  suppressing sensitive attributes from target datasets while preserving the other
  useful attributes, regardless of whether or not they are known in advance or explicitly
  annotated for preservation. We provide rigorous theoretical analyses on the operational
  bounds for our framework, and carry out comprehensive experimental evaluations using
  datasets of a variety of modalities, including facial images, voice audio clips,
  and human activity motion sensor signals. Results demonstrate the effectiveness
  and generalizability of our method under various configurations on a multitude of
  tasks. Our source code is available at this URL.
