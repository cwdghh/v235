title: 'Socialized Learning: Making Each Other Better Through Multi-Agent Collaboration'
openreview: aaeJpJw5Ur
abstract: 'Learning new knowledge frequently occurs in our dynamically changing world,
  e.g., humans culturally evolve by continuously acquiring new abilities to sustain
  their survival, leveraging collective intelligence rather than a large number of
  individual attempts. The effective learning paradigm during cultural evolution is
  termed socialized learning (SL). Consequently, a straightforward question arises:
  Can multi-agent systems acquire more new abilities like humans? In contrast to most
  existing methods that address continual learning and multi-agent collaboration,
  our emphasis lies in a more challenging problem: we prioritize the knowledge in
  the original expert classes, and as we adeptly learn new ones, the accuracy in the
  original expert classes stays superior among all in a directional manner. Inspired
  by population genetics and cognitive science, leading to unique and complete development,
  we propose Multi-Agent Socialized Collaboration (MASC), which achieves SL through
  interactions among multiple agents. Specifically, we introduce collective collaboration
  and reciprocal altruism modules, organizing collaborative behaviors, promoting information
  sharing, and facilitating learning and knowledge interaction among individuals.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-agent collaboration in an extensive empirical
  study. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/yxjdarren/SL.'
