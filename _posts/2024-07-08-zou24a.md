title: Leveraging Attractor Dynamics in Spatial Navigation for Better Language Parsing
openreview: eapFRURALQ
abstract: 'Increasing experimental evidence suggests that the human hippocampus, evolutionarily
  shaped by spatial navigation tasks, also plays an important role in language comprehension,
  indicating a shared computational mechanism for both functions. However, the specific
  relationship between the hippocampal formationâ€™s computational mechanism in spatial
  navigation and its role in language processing remains elusive. To investigate this
  question, we develop a prefrontal-hippocampal-entorhinal model (which called PHE-trinity)
  that features two key aspects: 1) the use of a modular continuous attractor neural
  network to represent syntactic structure, akin to the grid network in the entorhinal
  cortex; 2) the creation of two separate input streams, mirroring the factorized
  structure-content representation found in the hippocampal formation. We evaluate
  our model on language command parsing tasks, specifically using the SCAN dataset.
  Our findings include: 1) attractor dynamics can facilitate systematic generalization
  and efficient learning from limited data; 2) through visualization and reverse engineering,
  we unravel a potential dynamic mechanism for grid network representing syntactic
  structure. Our research takes an initial step in uncovering the dynamic mechanism
  shared by spatial navigation and language information processing.'
