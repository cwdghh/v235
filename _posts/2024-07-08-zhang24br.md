title: 'Causal Representation Learning from Multiple Distributions: A General Setting'
openreview: Pte6iiXvpf
abstract: In many problems, the measured variables (e.g., image pixels) are just mathematical
  functions of the latent causal variables (e.g., the underlying concepts or objects).
  For the purpose of making predictions in changing environments or making proper
  changes to the system, it is helpful to recover the latent causal variables $Z_i$
  and their causal relations represented by graph $\mathcal{G}_Z$. This problem has
  recently been known as causal representation learning. This paper is concerned with
  a general, completely nonparametric setting of causal representation learning from
  multiple distributions (arising from heterogeneous data or nonstationary time series),
  without assuming hard interventions behind distribution changes. We aim to develop
  general solutions in this fundamental case; as a by product, this helps see the
  unique benefit offered by other assumptions such as parametric causal models or
  hard interventions. We show that under the sparsity constraint on the recovered
  graph over the latent variables and suitable sufficient change conditions on the
  causal influences, interestingly, one can recover the moralized graph of the underlying
  directed acyclic graph, and the recovered latent variables and their relations are
  related to the underlying causal model in a specific, nontrivial way. In some cases,
  most latent variables can even be recovered up to component-wise transformations.
  Experimental results verify our theoretical claims.
