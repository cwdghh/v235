title: Incorporating probabilistic domain knowledge into deep multiple instance learning
openreview: GfNyqrwECJ
abstract: Deep learning methods, including deep multiple instance learning methods,
  have been criticized for their limited ability to incorporate domain knowledge.
  A reason that knowledge incorporation is challenging in deep learning is that the
  models usually lack a mapping between their model components and the entities of
  the domain, making it a non-trivial task to incorporate probabilistic prior information.
  In this work, we show that such a mapping between domain entities and model components
  can be defined for a multiple instance learning setting and propose a framework
  DeeMILIP that encompasses multiple strategies to exploit this mapping for prior
  knowledge incorporation. We motivate and formalize these strategies from a probabilistic
  perspective. Experiments on an immune-based diagnostics case show that our proposed
  strategies allow to learn generalizable models even in settings with weak signals,
  limited dataset size, and limited compute.
