title: 'Position: Tensor Networks are a Valuable Asset for Green AI'
openreview: mcg6jppkwb
abstract: For the first time, this position paper introduces a fundamental link between
  tensor networks (TNs) and Green AI, highlighting their synergistic potential to
  enhance both the inclusivity and sustainability of AI research. We argue that TNs
  are valuable for Green AI due to their strong mathematical backbone and inherent
  logarithmic compression potential. We undertake a comprehensive review of the ongoing
  discussions on Green AI, emphasizing the importance of sustainability and inclusivity
  in AI research to demonstrate the significance of establishing the link between
  Green AI and TNs. To support our position, we first provide a comprehensive overview
  of efficiency metrics proposed in Green AI literature and then evaluate examples
  of TNs in the fields of kernel machines and deep learning using the proposed efficiency
  metrics. This position paper aims to incentivize meaningful, constructive discussions
  by bridging fundamental principles of Green AI and TNs. We advocate for researchers
  to seriously evaluate the integration of TNs into their research projects, and in
  alignment with the link established in this paper, we support prior calls encouraging
  researchers to treat Green AI principles as a research priority.
