title: Inferring Change Points in High-Dimensional Linear Regression via Approximate
  Message Passing
openreview: 1JgCpZS17T
abstract: We consider the problem of localizing change points in high-dimensional
  linear regression. We propose an Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm for
  estimating both the signals and the change point locations. Assuming Gaussian covariates,
  we give an exact asymptotic characterization of its estimation performance in the
  limit where the number of samples grows proportionally to the signal dimension.
  Our algorithm can be tailored to exploit any prior information on the signal, noise,
  and change points. It also enables uncertainty quantification in the form of an
  efficiently computable approximate posterior distribution, whose asymptotic form
  we characterize exactly. We validate our theory via numerical experiments, and demonstrate
  the favorable performance of our estimators on both synthetic data and images.
