title: Zero-Shot ECG Classification with Multimodal Learning and Test-time Clinical
  Knowledge Enhancement
openreview: ZvJ2lQQKjz
abstract: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) are non-invasive diagnostic tools crucial for
  detecting cardiac arrhythmic diseases in clinical practice. While ECG Self-supervised
  Learning (eSSL) methods show promise in representation learning from unannotated
  ECG data, they often overlook the clinical knowledge that can be found in reports.
  This oversight and the requirement for annotated samples for downstream tasks limit
  eSSLâ€™s versatility. In this work, we address these issues with the <b>M</b>ultimodal
  <b>E</b>CG <b>R</b>epresentation <b>L</b>earning (<b>MERL</b>) framework. Through
  multimodal learning on ECG records and associated reports, MERL is capable of performing
  zero-shot ECG classification with text prompts, eliminating the need for training
  data in downstream tasks. At test time, we propose the <b>C</b>linical <b>K</b>nowledge
  <b>E</b>nhanced <b>P</b>rompt <b>E</b>ngineering (<b>CKEPE</b>) approach, which
  uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to exploit external expert-verified clinical knowledge
  databases, generating more descriptive prompts and reducing hallucinations in LLM-generated
  content to boost zero-shot classification. Based on MERL, we perform the first benchmark
  across six public ECG datasets, showing the superior performance of MERL compared
  against eSSL methods. Notably, MERL achieves an average AUC score of 75.2% in zero-shot
  classification (<b>without training data</b>), 3.2% higher than linear probed eSSL
  methods with 10% annotated training data, averaged across all six datasets.
