title: 'OLLIE: Imitation Learning from Offline Pretraining to Online Finetuning'
openreview: eG42XBhV9a
abstract: In this paper, we study offline-to-online Imitation Learning (IL) that pretrains
  an imitation policy from static demonstration data, followed by fast finetuning
  with minimal environmental interaction. We find the naive combination of existing
  offline IL and online IL methods tends to behave poorly in this context, because
  the initial discriminator (often used in online IL) operates randomly and discordantly
  against the policy initialization, leading to misguided policy optimization and
  <em>unlearning</em> of pretraining knowledge. To overcome this challenge, we propose
  a principled offline-to-online IL method, named OLLIE, that simultaneously learns
  a near-expert policy initialization along with an <em>aligned discriminator initialization</em>,
  which can be seamlessly integrated into online IL, achieving smooth and fast finetuning.
  Empirically, OLLIE consistently and significantly outperforms the baseline methods
  in <b>20</b> challenging tasks, from continuous control to vision-based domains,
  in terms of performance, demonstration efficiency, and convergence speed. This work
  may serve as a foundation for further exploration of pretraining and finetuning
  in the context of IL.
