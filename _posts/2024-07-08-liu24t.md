title: Bidirectional Reciprocative Information Communication for Few-Shot Semantic
  Segmentation
openreview: uRz9GZN17X
abstract: Existing few-shot semantic segmentation methods typically rely on a one-way
  flow of category information from support to query, ignoring the impact of intra-class
  diversity. To address this, drawing inspiration from cybernetics, we introduce a
  Query Feedback Branch (QFB) to propagate query information back to support, generating
  a query-related support prototype that is more aligned with the query. Subsequently,
  a Query Amplifier Branch (QAB) is employed to amplify target objects in the query
  using the acquired support prototype. To further improve the model, we propose a
  Query Rectification Module (QRM), which utilizes the prediction disparity in the
  query before and after support activation to identify challenging positive and negative
  samples from ambiguous regions for query self-rectification. Furthermore, we integrate
  the QFB, QAB, and QRM into a feedback and rectification layer and incorporate it
  into an iterative pipeline. This configuration enables the progressive enhancement
  of bidirectional reciprocative flow of category information between query and support,
  effectively providing query-adaptive support information and addressing the intra-class
  diversity problem. Extensive experiments conducted on both PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i
  datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at https://github.com/LIUYUANWEI98/IFRNet
