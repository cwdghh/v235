title: 'How Uniform Random Weights Induce Non-uniform Bias: Typical Interpolating
  Neural Networks Generalize with Narrow Teachers'
openreview: 3eHNvPHL9Z
abstract: 'A main theoretical puzzle is why over-parameterized Neural Networks (NNs)
  generalize well when trained to zero loss (i.e., so they interpolate the data).
  Usually, the NN is trained with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or one of its
  variants. However, recent empirical work examined the generalization of a random
  NN that interpolates the data: the NN was sampled from a seemingly uniform prior
  over the parameters, conditioned on that the NN perfectly classifying the training
  set. Interestingly, such a NN sample typically generalized as well as SGD-trained
  NNs. We prove that such a random NN interpolator typically generalizes well if there
  exists an underlying narrow “teacher NN" that agrees with the labels. Specifically,
  we show that such a ‘flat’ prior over the NN parametrization induces a rich prior
  over the NN functions, due to the redundancy in the NN structure. In particular,
  this creates a bias towards simpler functions, which require less relevant parameters
  to represent — enabling learning with a sample complexity approximately proportional
  to the complexity of the teacher (roughly, the number of non-redundant parameters),
  rather than the student’s.'
