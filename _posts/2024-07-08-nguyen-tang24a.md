title: On The Statistical Complexity of Offline Decision-Making
openreview: dYDPcx78tm
abstract: We study the statistical complexity of offline decision-making with function
  approximation, establishing (near) minimax-optimal rates for stochastic contextual
  bandits and Markov decision processes. The performance limits are captured by the
  pseudo-dimension of the (value) function class and a new characterization of the
  behavior policy that <em>strictly</em> subsumes all the previous notions of data
  coverage in the offline decision-making literature. In addition, we seek to understand
  the benefits of using offline data in online decision-making and show nearly minimax-optimal
  rates in a wide range of regimes.
