title: Explaining Probabilistic Models with Distributional Values
openreview: 37xFIeYgE0
abstract: A large branch of explainable machine learning is grounded in cooperative
  game theory. However, research indicates that game-theoretic explanations may mislead
  or be hard to interpret. We argue that often there is a critical mismatch between
  what one wishes to explain (e.g. the output of a classifier) and what current methods
  such as SHAP explain (e.g. the scalar probability of a class). This paper addresses
  such gap for probabilistic models by generalising cooperative games and value operators.
  We introduce the <em>distributional values</em>, random variables that track changes
  in the model output (e.g. flipping of the predicted class) and derive their analytic
  expressions for games with Gaussian, Bernoulli and Categorical payoffs. We further
  establish several characterising properties, and show that our framework provides
  fine-grained and insightful explanations with case studies on vision and language
  models.
