title: Optimal Coresets for Low-Dimensional Geometric Median
openreview: 8iWDWQKxJ1
abstract: We investigate coresets for approximating the cost with respect to median
  queries. In this problem, we are given a set of points $P\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and
  median queries are $\sum_{p\in P} ||p-c||$ for any point $c\in \mathbb{R}^d$. Our
  goal is to compute a small weighted summary $S\subset P$ such that the cost of any
  median query is approximated within a multiplicative $(1\pm\varepsilon)$ factor.
  We provide matching upper and lower bounds on the number of points contained in
  $S$ of the order $\tilde{\Theta}\left(\varepsilon^{-d/(d+1)}\right)$.
