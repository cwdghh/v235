title: Evaluating and Analyzing Relationship Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language
  Models
openreview: xpSlt67vxQ
abstract: 'The issue of hallucinations is a prevalent concern in existing Large Vision-Language
  Models (LVLMs). Previous efforts have primarily focused on investigating object
  hallucinations, which can be easily alleviated by introducing object detectors.
  However, these efforts neglect hallucinations in inter-object relationships, which
  is essential for visual comprehension. In this work, we introduce R-Bench, a novel
  benchmark for evaluating Vision Relationship Hallucination. R-Bench features image-level
  questions that focus on the existence of relationships and instance-level questions
  that assess local visual comprehension. We identify three types of relationship
  co-occurrences that lead to hallucinations: relationship-relationship, subject-relationship,
  and relationship-object. The visual instruction tuning dataset’s long-tail distribution
  significantly impacts LVLMs’ understanding of visual relationships. Additionally,
  our analysis reveals that current LVLMs tend to overlook visual content, overly
  rely on the common sense knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs), and struggle
  with spatial relationship reasoning based on contextual information.'
