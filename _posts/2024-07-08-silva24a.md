title: Embarrassingly Parallel GFlowNets
openreview: KJhLpzqNri
abstract: GFlowNets are a promising alternative to MCMC sampling for discrete compositional
  random variables. Training GFlowNets requires repeated evaluations of the unnormalized
  target distribution, or reward function. However, for large-scale posterior sampling,
  this may be prohibitive since it incurs traversing the data several times. Moreover,
  if the data are distributed across clients, employing standard GFlowNets leads to
  intensive client-server communication. To alleviate both these issues, we propose
  <em>embarrassingly parallel</em> GFlowNet (EP-GFlowNet). EP-GFlowNet is a provably
  correct divide-and-conquer method to sample from product distributions of the form
  $R(\cdot) \propto R_1(\cdot) ... R_N(\cdot)$ â€” e.g., in parallel or federated Bayes,
  where each $R_n$ is a local posterior defined on a data partition. First, in parallel,
  we train a local GFlowNet targeting each $R_n$ and send the resulting models to
  the server. Then, the server learns a global GFlowNet by enforcing our newly proposed
  <em>aggregating balance</em> condition, requiring a single communication step. Importantly,
  EP-GFlowNets can also be applied to multi-objective optimization and model reuse.
  Our experiments illustrate the effectiveness of EP-GFlowNets on multiple tasks,
  including parallel Bayesian phylogenetics, multi-objective multiset and sequence
  generation, and federated Bayesian structure learning.
