title: Pursuing Overall Welfare in Federated Learning through Sequential Decision
  Making
openreview: foPMkomvk1
abstract: 'In traditional federated learning, a single global model cannot perform
  equally well for all clients. Therefore, the need to achieve the <em>client-level
  fairness</em> in federated system has been emphasized, which can be realized by
  modifying the static aggregation scheme for updating the global model to an adaptive
  one, in response to the local signals of the participating clients. Our work reveals
  that existing fairness-aware aggregation strategies can be unified into an online
  convex optimization framework, in other words, a central serverâ€™s <em>sequential
  decision making</em> process. To enhance the decision making capability, we propose
  simple and intuitive improvements for suboptimal designs within existing methods,
  presenting $\texttt{AAggFF}$. Considering practical requirements, we further subdivide
  our method tailored for the <em>cross-device</em> and the <em>cross-silo</em> settings,
  respectively. Theoretical analyses guarantee sublinear regret upper bounds for both
  settings: $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log{K}})$ for the cross-device setting, and $\mathcal{O}(K
  \log{T})$ for the cross-silo setting, with $K$ clients and $T$ federation rounds.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that the federated system equipped with $\texttt{AAggFF}$
  achieves better degree of client-level fairness than existing methods in both practical
  settings.'
