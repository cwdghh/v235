title: Locally Estimated Global Perturbations are Better than Local Perturbations
  for Federated Sharpness-aware Minimization
openreview: 6axTFAlzRV
abstract: In federated learning (FL), the multi-step update and data heterogeneity
  among clients often lead to a loss landscape with sharper minima, degenerating the
  performance of the resulted global model. Prevalent federated approaches incorporate
  sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) into local training to mitigate this problem.
  However, the local loss landscapes may not accurately reflect the flatness of global
  loss landscape in heterogeneous environments; as a result, minimizing local sharpness
  and calculating perturbations on client data might not align the efficacy of SAM
  in FL with centralized training. To overcome this challenge, we propose FedLESAM,
  a novel algorithm that locally estimates the direction of global perturbation on
  client side as the difference between global models received in the previous active
  and current rounds. Besides the improved quality, FedLESAM also speed up federated
  SAM-based approaches since it only performs once backpropagation in each iteration.
  Theoretically, we prove a slightly tighter bound than its original FedSAM by ensuring
  consistent perturbation. Empirically, we conduct comprehensive experiments on four
  federated benchmark datasets under three partition strategies to demonstrate the
  superior performance and efficiency of FedLESAM.
