title: Enhancing Implicit Shape Generators Using Topological Regularizations
openreview: XBNhJQU84y
abstract: A fundamental problem in learning 3D shapes generative models is that when
  the generative model is simply fitted to the training data, the resulting synthetic
  3D models can present various artifacts. Many of these artifacts are topological
  in nature, e.g., broken legs, unrealistic thin structures, and small holes. In this
  paper, we introduce a principled approach that utilizes topological regularization
  losses on an implicit shape generator to rectify topological artifacts. The objectives
  are two-fold. The first is to align the persistent diagram (PD) distribution of
  the training shapes with that of synthetic shapes. The second ensures that the PDs
  are smooth among adjacent synthetic shapes. We show how to achieve these two objectives
  using two simple but effective formulations. Specifically, distribution alignment
  is achieved to learn a generative model of PDs and align this generator with PDs
  of synthetic shapes. We show how to handle discrete and continuous variabilities
  of PDs by using a shape-regularization term when performing PD alignment. Moreover,
  we enforce the smoothness of the PDs using a smoothness loss on the PD generator,
  which further improves the behavior of PD distribution alignment. Experimental results
  on ShapeNet show that our approach leads to much better generalization behavior
  than state-of-the-art implicit shape generators.
