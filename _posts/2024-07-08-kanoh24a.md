title: Neural Tangent Kernels for Axis-Aligned Tree Ensembles
openreview: YxmcEfcgp3
abstract: 'While axis-aligned rules are known to induce an important inductive bias
  in machine learning models such as typical hard decision tree ensembles, theoretical
  understanding of the learning behavior is largely unrevealed due to the discrete
  nature of rules. To address this issue, we impose the axis-aligned constraint on
  soft trees, which relax the splitting process of decision trees and are trained
  using a gradient method, and present their Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), which enables
  us to analytically describe the training behavior. We study two cases: imposing
  the axis-aligned constraint throughout the entire training process, and only at
  the initial state. Moreover, we extend the NTK framework to handle various tree
  architectures simultaneously, and prove that any axis-aligned non-oblivious tree
  ensemble can be transformed into axis-aligned oblivious tree ensembles with the
  same NTK. One can search for suitable tree architecture via Multiple Kernel Learning
  (MKL), and our numerical experiments show a variety of suitable features depending
  on the type of constraints. Our NTK analysis highlights both the theoretical and
  practical impacts of the axis-aligned constraint in tree ensemble learning.'
