title: 'Position: Machine Learning-powered Assessments of the EU Digital Services
  Act Aid Quantify Policy Impacts on Online Harms'
openreview: hdpv6mall8
abstract: While machine learning shows promise in automated knowledge generation,
  current techniques such as large language models and micro-targeted influence operations
  can be exploited for harmful purposes like the proliferation of disinformation.
  The European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA) is an exemplary policy response
  addressing these harms generated by online platforms. In this regard, it necessitates
  a comprehensive evaluation of its impact on curbing the harmful downstream effects
  of these opaque practices. Despite their harmful applications, we argue that machine
  learning techniques offer immense, yet under-exploited, potential for unraveling
  the impacts of regulations like the DSA. Following an analysis that reveals possible
  limitations in the DSA’s provisions, we call for resolute efforts to address methodological
  barriers around appropriate data access, isolating marginal regulatory effects,
  and facilitating generalization across different contexts. Given the identified
  advantages of data-driven approaches to regulatory delivery, we advocate for machine
  learning research to help quantify the policy impacts on online harms.
