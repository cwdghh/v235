title: Spectral Preconditioning for Gradient Methods on Graded Non-convex Functions
openreview: NvBJOcmti6
abstract: The performance of optimization methods is often tied to the spectrum of
  the objective Hessian. Yet, conventional assumptions, such as smoothness, do often
  not enable us to make finely-grained convergence statementsâ€”particularly not for
  non-convex problems. Striving for a more intricate characterization of complexity,
  we introduce a unique concept termed graded non-convexity. This allows to partition
  the class of non-convex problems into a nested chain of subclasses. Interestingly,
  many traditional non-convex objectives, including partially convex problems, matrix
  factorizations, and neural networks, fall within these subclasses. As a second contribution,
  we propose gradient methods with spectral preconditioning, which employ inexact
  top eigenvectors of the Hessian to address the ill-conditioning of the problem,
  contingent on the grade. Our analysis reveals that these new methods provide provably
  superior convergence rates compared to basic gradient descent on applicable problem
  classes, particularly when large gaps exist between the top eigenvalues of the Hessian.
  Our theory is validated by numerical experiments executed on multiple practical
  machine learning problems.
