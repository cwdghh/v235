title: 'Position: An Inner Interpretability Framework for AI Inspired by Lessons from
  Cognitive Neuroscience'
openreview: 66KmnMhGU5
abstract: 'Inner Interpretability is a promising emerging field tasked with uncovering
  the inner mechanisms of AI systems, though how to develop these mechanistic theories
  is still much debated. Moreover, recent critiques raise issues that question its
  usefulness to advance the broader goals of AI. However, it has been overlooked that
  these issues resemble those that have been grappled with in another field: Cognitive
  Neuroscience. Here we draw the relevant connections and highlight lessons that can
  be transferred productively between fields. Based on these, we propose a general
  conceptual framework and give concrete methodological strategies for building mechanistic
  explanations in AI inner interpretability research. With this conceptual framework,
  Inner Interpretability can fend off critiques and position itself on a productive
  path to explain AI systems.'
