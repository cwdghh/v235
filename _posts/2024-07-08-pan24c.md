title: "$S^2$IP-LLM: Semantic Space Informed Prompt Learning with LLM for Time Series
  Forecasting"
openreview: qwQVV5R8Y7
abstract: Recently, there has been a growing interest in leveraging pre-trained large
  language models (LLMs) for various time series applications. However, the semantic
  space of LLMs, established through the pre-training, is still underexplored and
  may help yield more distinctive and informative representations to facilitate time
  series forecasting. To this end, we propose Semantic Space Informed Prompt learning
  with LLM ($S^2$IP-LLM) to align the pre-trained semantic space with time series
  embedding space and perform time series forecasting based on learned prompts from
  the joint space. We first design a tokenization module tailored for cross-modality
  alignment, which explicitly concatenates patches of decomposed time series components
  to create embeddings that effectively encode the temporal dynamics. Next, we leverage
  the pre-trained word token embeddings to derive semantic anchors and align selected
  anchors with time series embeddings by maximizing the cosine similarity in the joint
  space. This way, $S^2$IP-LLM can retrieve relevant semantic anchors as prompts to
  provide strong indicators (context) for time series that exhibit different temporal
  dynamics. With thorough empirical studies on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate
  that the proposed $S^2$IP-LLM can achieve superior forecasting performance over
  state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our ablation studies and visualizations
  verify the necessity of prompt learning informed by semantic space.
