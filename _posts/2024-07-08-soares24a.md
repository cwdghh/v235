title: Probabilistic Modeling of Interpersonal Coordination Processes
openreview: 4zOZ0yKhm6
abstract: We develop a novel probabilistic model for interpersonal coordination as
  a latent phenomenon explaining statistical temporal influence between multiple components
  in a system. For example, the state of one person can influence that of another
  at a later time, as indicated by their observed behaviors. We characterize coordination
  as the degree to which the distributions for such states at one time point are merged
  for the next salient time point. We evaluate our model in the context of three-person
  teams executing a virtual search and rescue (SAR) mission. We first use synthetic
  data to confirm that our technical definition of coordination is consistent with
  expectations and that we can recover generated coordination despite noise. We then
  show that captured coordination can be predictive of team performance on real data.
  Here we use speech vocalics and semantics to infer coordination for 36 teams carrying
  out two successive SAR missions. In two different datasets, we find that coordination
  is generally predictive of team score for the second mission, but not for the first,
  where teams are largely learning to play the game. In addition, we found that including
  a semantic modality improves prediction in some scenarios. This shows that our intuitive
  technical definition can capture useful explanatory aspects of team behavior.
