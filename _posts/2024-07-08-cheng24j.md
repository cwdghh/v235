title: 'RICE: Breaking Through the Training Bottlenecks of Reinforcement Learning
  with Explanation'
openreview: PKJqsZD5nQ
abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is playing an increasingly important role
  in real-world applications. However, obtaining an optimally performing DRL agent
  for complex tasks, especially with sparse rewards, remains a significant challenge.
  The training of a DRL agent can be often trapped in a bottleneck without further
  progress. In this paper, we propose RICE, an innovative refining scheme for reinforcement
  learning that incorporates explanation methods to break through the training bottlenecks.
  The high-level idea of RICE is to construct a new initial state distribution that
  combines both the default initial states and critical states identified through
  explanation methods, thereby encouraging the agent to explore from the mixed initial
  states. Through careful design, we can theoretically guarantee that our refining
  scheme has a tighter sub-optimality bound. We evaluate RICE in various popular RL
  environments and real-world applications. The results demonstrate that RICE significantly
  outperforms existing refining schemes in enhancing agent performance.
