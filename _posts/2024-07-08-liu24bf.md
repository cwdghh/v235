title: New Sample Complexity Bounds for Sample Average Approximation in Heavy-Tailed
  Stochastic Programming
openreview: 2hWd4CVhXz
abstract: This paper studies sample average approximation (SAA) and its simple regularized
  variation in solving convex or strongly convex stochastic programming problems.
  Under heavy-tailed assumptions and comparable regularity conditions as in the typical
  SAA literature, we show — perhaps for the first time — that the sample complexity
  can be completely free from any complexity measure (e.g., logarithm of the covering
  number) of the feasible region. As a result, our new bounds can be more advantageous
  than the state-of-the-art in terms of the dependence on the problem dimensionality.
