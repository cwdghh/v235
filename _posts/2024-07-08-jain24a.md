title: 'Position: Scarce Resource Allocations That Rely On Machine Learning Should
  Be Randomized'
openreview: 44qxX6Ty6F
abstract: Contrary to traditional deterministic notions of algorithmic fairness, this
  paper argues that fairly allocating scarce resources using machine learning often
  requires randomness. We address why, when, and how to randomize by offering a set
  of stochastic procedures that more adequately account for all of the claims individuals
  have to allocations of social goods or opportunities and effectively balances their
  interests.
