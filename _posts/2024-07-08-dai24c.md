title: High-Order Contrastive Learning with Fine-grained Comparative Levels for Sparse
  Ordinal Tensor Completion
openreview: PDO2Oc1cS1
abstract: Contrastive learning is a powerful paradigm for representation learning
  with prominent success in computer vision and NLP, but how to extend its success
  to high-dimensional tensors remains a challenge. This is because tensor data often
  exhibit high-order mode-interactions that are hard to profile and with negative
  samples growing combinatorially faster than second-order contrastive learning; furthermore,
  many real-world tensors have ordinal entries that necessitate more delicate comparative
  levels. To solve the challenge, we propose High-Order Contrastive Tensor Completion
  (HOCTC), an innovative network to extend contrastive learning to sparse ordinal
  tensor data. HOCTC employs a novel attention-based strategy with query-expansion
  to capture high-order mode interactions even in case of very limited tokens, which
  transcends beyond second-order learning scenarios. Besides, it extends two-level
  comparisons (positive-vs-negative) to fine-grained contrast-levels using ordinal
  tensor entries as a natural guidance. Efficient sampling scheme is proposed to enforce
  such delicate comparative structures, generating comprehensive self-supervised signals
  for high-order representation learning. Extensive experiments show that HOCTC has
  promising results in sparse tensor completion in traffic/recommender applications.
