title: Predicting Dose-Response Curves with Deep Neural Networks
openreview: MDAg5Q7IsI
abstract: Dose-response curves characterize the relationship between the concentration
  of drugs and their inhibitory effect on the growth of specific types of cells. The
  predominant Hill-equation model of an ideal enzymatic inhibition unduly simplifies
  the biochemical reality of many drugs; and for these drugs the widely-used drug
  performance indicator of the half-inhibitory concentration $IC_{50}$ can lead to
  poor therapeutic recommendations and poor selections of promising drug candidates.
  We develop a neural model that uses an embedding of the interaction between drug
  molecules and the tissue transcriptome to estimate the entire dose-response curve
  rather than a scalar aggregate. We find that, compared to the prior state of the
  art, this model excels at interpolating and extrapolating the inhibitory effect
  of untried concentrations. Unlike prevalent parametric models, it it able to accurately
  predict dose-response curves of drugs on previously unseen tumor tissues as well
  as of previously untested drug molecules on established tumor cell lines.
