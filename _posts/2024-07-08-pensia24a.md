title: A Subquadratic Time Algorithm for Robust Sparse Mean Estimation
openreview: WSi4IiMaCx
abstract: We study the algorithmic problem of sparse mean estimation in the presence
  of adversarial outliers. Specifically, the algorithm observes a <em>corrupted</em>
  set of samples from $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\mathbf{I}_d)$, where the unknown mean $\mu
  \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is constrained to be $k$-sparse. A series of prior works has developed
  efficient algorithms for robust sparse mean estimation with sample complexity $\mathrm{poly}(k,\log
  d, 1/\epsilon)$ and runtime $d^2 \mathrm{poly}(k,\log d,1/\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon$
  is the fraction of contamination. In particular, the fastest runtime of existing
  algorithms is quadratic in the dimension, which can be prohibitive in high dimensions.
  This quadratic barrier in the runtime stems from the reliance of these algorithms
  on the sample covariance matrix, which is of size $d^2$. Our main contribution is
  an algorithm for robust sparse mean estimation which runs in <em>subquadratic</em>
  time using $\mathrm{poly}(k,\log d,1/\epsilon)$ samples. Our results build on algorithmic
  advances in detecting weak correlations, a generalized version of the light-bulb
  problem by Valiant (2015).
