title: One-Shot Strategic Classification Under Unknown Costs
openreview: OURP5Z58jt
abstract: The goal of strategic classification is to learn decision rules which are
  robust to strategic input manipulation. Earlier works assume that these responses
  are known; while some recent works handle unknown responses, they exclusively study
  online settings with repeated model deployments. But there are many domains – particularly
  in public policy, a common motivating use case – where multiple deployments are
  infeasible, or where even one bad round is unacceptable. To address this gap, we
  initiate the formal study of <em>one-shot</em> strategic classification under unknown
  responses, which requires committing to a single classifier once. Focusing on uncertainty
  in the users’ cost function, we begin by proving that for a broad class of costs,
  even a small mis-estimation of the true cost can entail trivial accuracy in the
  worst case. In light of this, we frame the task as a minimax problem, aiming to
  minimize worst-case risk over an uncertainty set of costs. We design efficient algorithms
  for both the full-batch and stochastic settings, which we prove converge (offline)
  to the minimax solution at the rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-\frac{1}{2}})$.
  Our analysis reveals important structure stemming from strategic responses, particularly
  the value of <em>dual norm regularization</em> with respect to the cost function.
