title: Matrix Information Theory for Self-Supervised Learning
openreview: wleAlsklEh
abstract: The maximum entropy encoding framework provides a unified perspective for
  many non-contrastive learning methods like SimSiam, Barlow Twins, and MEC. Inspired
  by this framework, we introduce Matrix-SSL, a novel approach that leverages matrix
  information theory to interpret the maximum entropy encoding loss as matrix uniformity
  loss. Furthermore, Matrix-SSL enhances the maximum entropy encoding method by seamlessly
  incorporating matrix alignment loss, directly aligning covariance matrices in different
  branches. Experimental results reveal that Matrix-SSL outperforms state-of-the-art
  methods on the ImageNet dataset under linear evaluation settings and on MS-COCO
  for transfer learning tasks. Specifically, when performing transfer learning tasks
  on MS-COCO, our method outperforms previous SOTA methods such as MoCo v2 and BYOL
  up to 3.3% with only 400 epochs compared to 800 epochs pre-training. We also try
  to introduce representation learning into the language modeling regime by fine-tuning
  a 7B model using matrix cross-entropy loss, with a margin of 3.1% on the GSM8K dataset
  over the standard cross-entropy loss.
