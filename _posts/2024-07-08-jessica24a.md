title: Finite Volume Features, Global Geometry Representations, and Residual Training
  for Deep Learning-based CFD Simulation
openreview: WzD4a5ufN8
abstract: 'Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation is an irreplaceable modelling
  step in many engineering designs, but it is often computationally expensive. Some
  graph neural network (GNN)-based CFD methods have been proposed. However, the current
  methods inherit the weakness of traditional numerical simulators, as well as ignore
  the cell characteristics in the mesh used in the finite volume method, a common
  method in practical CFD applications. Specifically, the input nodes in these GNN
  methods have very limited information about any object immersed in the simulation
  domain and its surrounding environment. Also, the cell characteristics of the mesh
  such as cell volume, face surface area, and face centroid are not included in the
  message-passing operations in the GNN methods. To address these weaknesses, this
  work proposes two novel geometric representations: Shortest Vector (SV) and Directional
  Integrated Distance (DID). Extracted from the mesh, the SV and DID provide global
  geometry perspective to each input node, thus removing the need to collect this
  information through message-passing. This work also introduces the use of Finite
  Volume Features (FVF) in the graph convolutions as node and edge attributes, enabling
  its message-passing operations to adjust to different nodes. Finally, this work
  is the first to demonstrate how residual training, with the availability of low-resolution
  data, can be adopted to improve the flow field prediction accuracy. Experimental
  results on two datasets with five different state-of-the-art GNN methods for CFD
  indicate that SV, DID, FVF and residual training can effectively reduce the predictive
  error of current GNN-based methods by as much as 41%. Our codes and datasets are
  available at https://github.com/toggled/FvFGeo.'
