title: Infinite-Horizon Distributionally Robust Regret-Optimal Control
openreview: h3SGdpI4Ta
abstract: We study the infinite-horizon distributionally robust (DR) control of linear
  systems with quadratic costs, where disturbances have unknown, possibly time-correlated
  distribution within a Wasserstein-2 ambiguity set. We aim to minimize the worst-case
  expected regretâ€”the excess cost of a causal policy compared to a non-causal one
  with access to future disturbance. Though the optimal policy lacks a finite-order
  state-space realization (i.e., it is non-rational), it can be characterized by a
  finite-dimensional parameter. Leveraging this, we develop an efficient frequency-domain
  algorithm to compute this optimal control policy and present a convex optimization
  method to construct a near-optimal state-space controller that approximates the
  optimal non-rational controller in the $\mathit{H}_\infty$-norm. This approach avoids
  solving a computationally expensive semi-definite program (SDP) that scales with
  the time horizon in the finite-horizon setting.
