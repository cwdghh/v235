title: 'FRAG: Frequency Adapting Group for Diffusion Video Editing'
openreview: OnEaBGU3LO
abstract: 'In video editing, the hallmark of a quality edit lies in its consistent
  and unobtrusive adjustment. Modification, when integrated, must be smooth and subtle,
  preserving the natural flow and aligning seamlessly with the original vision. Therefore,
  our primary focus is on overcoming the current challenges in high quality edit to
  ensure that each edit enhances the final product without disrupting its intended
  essence. However, quality deterioration such as blurring and flickering is routinely
  observed in recent diffusion video editing systems. We confirm that this deterioration
  often stems from high-frequency leak: the diffusion model fails to accurately synthesize
  high-frequency components during denoising process. To this end, we devise Frequency
  Adapting Group (FRAG) which enhances the video quality in terms of consistency and
  fidelity by introducing a novel receptive field branch to preserve high-frequency
  components during the denoising process. FRAG is performed in a model-agnostic manner
  without additional training and validates the effectiveness on video editing benchmarks
  (i.e., TGVE, DAVIS).'
