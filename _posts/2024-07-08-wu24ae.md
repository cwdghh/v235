title: Mitigating Label Noise on Graphs via Topological Sample Selection
openreview: BRIcZiK5Fr
abstract: 'Despite the success of the carefully-annotated benchmarks, the effectiveness
  of existing graph neural networks (GNNs) can be considerably impaired in practice
  when the real-world graph data is noisily labeled. Previous explorations in sample
  selection have been demonstrated as an effective way for robust learning with noisy
  labels, however, the conventional studies focus on i.i.d data, and when moving to
  non-iid graph data and GNNs, two notable challenges remain: (1) nodes located near
  topological class boundaries are very informative for classification but cannot
  be successfully distinguished by the heuristic sample selection. (2) there is no
  available measure that considers the graph topological information to promote sample
  selection in a graph. To address this dilemma, we propose a $\textit{Topological
  Sample Selection}$ (TSS) method that boosts the informative sample selection process
  in a graph by utilising topological information. We theoretically prove that our
  procedure minimizes an upper bound of the expected risk under target clean distribution,
  and experimentally show the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art
  baselines.'
