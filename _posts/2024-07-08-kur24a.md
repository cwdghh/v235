title: Minimum Norm Interpolation Meets The Local Theory of Banach Spaces
openreview: G4b32bKnBy
abstract: Minimum-norm interpolators have recently gained attention primarily as an
  analyzable model to shed light on the double descent phenomenon observed for neural
  networks. The majority of the work has focused on analyzing interpolators in Hilbert
  spaces, where typically an effectively low-rank structure of the feature covariance
  prevents a large bias. More recently, tight vanishing bounds have also been shown
  for isotropic high-dimensional data for $\ell_p$-spaces with $p\in[1,2)$, leveraging
  sparse structure of the ground truth. However, these proofs are tailored to specific
  settings and hard to generalize. This paper takes a first step towards establishing
  a general framework that connects generalization properties of the interpolators
  to well-known concepts from high-dimensional geometry, specifically, from the local
  theory of Banach spaces. In particular, we show that under $2$-uniform convexity,
  the bias of the minimal norm solution is bounded by the Gaussian complexity of the
  class. We then prove a “reverse” Efron-Stein lower bound on the expected conditional
  variance of the minimal norm solution under cotype $2$. Finally, we prove that this
  bound is sharp for $\ell_p$-linear regression under sub-Gaussian covariates.
