title: 'No Double Descent in Principal Component Regression: A High-Dimensional Analysis'
openreview: M4ejBhNNrn
abstract: Understanding the generalization properties of large-scale models necessitates
  incorporating realistic data assumptions into the analysis. Therefore, we consider
  Principal Component Regression (PCR)—combining principal component analysis and
  linear regression—on data from a low-dimensional manifold. We present an analysis
  of PCR when the data is sampled from a spiked covariance model, obtaining fundamental
  asymptotic guarantees for the generalization risk of this model. Our analysis is
  based on random matrix theory and allows us to provide guarantees for high-dimensional
  data. We additionally present an analysis of the distribution shift between training
  and test data. The results allow us to disentangle the effects of (1) the number
  of parameters, (2) the data-generating model and, (3) model misspecification on
  the generalization risk. The use of PCR effectively regularizes the model and prevents
  the interpolation peak of the double descent. Our theoretical findings are empirically
  validated in simulation, demonstrating their practical relevance.
