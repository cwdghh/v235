title: Assessing Large Language Models on Climate Information
openreview: ScIHQoTUjT
abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) rise in popularity, it is necessary to assess
  their capability in critically relevant domains. We present a comprehensive evaluation
  framework, grounded in science communication research, to assess LLM responses to
  questions about climate change. Our framework emphasizes both presentational and
  epistemological adequacy, offering a fine-grained analysis of LLM generations spanning
  8 dimensions and 30 issues. Our evaluation task is a real-world example of a growing
  number of challenging problems where AI can complement and lift human performance.
  We introduce a novel protocol for scalable oversight that relies on AI Assistance
  and raters with relevant education. We evaluate several recent LLMs on a set of
  diverse climate questions. Our results point to a significant gap between surface
  and epistemological qualities of LLMs in the realm of climate communication.
