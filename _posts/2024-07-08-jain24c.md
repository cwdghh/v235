title: 'R2E: Turning any Github Repository into a Programming Agent Environment'
openreview: kXHgEYFyf3
abstract: While Large Language Modelsâ€™ (LLMs) coding capabilities have advanced rapidly,
  corresponding evaluation benchmarks on real-world programming setups are yet to
  catch up. Building a scalable and interactive testbed for evaluating general-purpose
  AI coding agents for real-world code has been challenging, particularly due to a
  lack of high-quality test suites available. In this paper, we present Repository
  to Environment (R2E), a framework that can turn any GitHub repository into a test
  environment to evaluate the performance of code-generating systems, both static
  and interactive. R2E is powered by a synergistic combination of program analysis
  and LLMs to construct equivalence test harnesses for any GitHub function. We instantiate
  our framework to build the first large-scale benchmark, R2E-Eval1, for building
  realistic environments for AI coding assistants. Our results demonstrate that even
  when SOTA models cannot generate correct solutions with advanced prompting techniques,
  they can effectively use environment feedback highlighting the need to move from
  static functional coding to interactive programming paradigm. We hope that our framework
  (and the instantiated benchmark) can motivate research directions by providing web-scale
  open-ended coding environments. R2E code is available at https://r2e.dev/
