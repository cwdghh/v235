title: Learning a Diffusion Model Policy from Rewards via Q-Score Matching
openreview: 35ahHydjXo
abstract: 'Diffusion models have become a popular choice for representing actor policies
  in behavior cloning and offline reinforcement learning. This is due to their natural
  ability to optimize an expressive class of distributions over a continuous space.
  However, previous works fail to exploit the score-based structure of diffusion models,
  and instead utilize a simple behavior cloning term to train the actor, limiting
  their ability in the actor-critic setting. In this paper, we present a theoretical
  framework linking the structure of diffusion model policies to a learned Q-function,
  by linking the structure between the score of the policy to the action gradient
  of the Q-function. We focus on off-policy reinforcement learning and propose a new
  policy update method from this theory, which we denote Q-score matching. Notably,
  this algorithm only needs to differentiate through the denoising model rather than
  the entire diffusion model evaluation, and converged policies through Q-score matching
  are implicitly multi-modal and explorative in continuous domains. We conduct experiments
  in simulated environments to demonstrate the viability of our proposed method and
  compare to popular baselines. Source code is available from the project website:
