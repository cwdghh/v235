title: Stability and Multigroup Fairness in Ranking with Uncertain Predictions
openreview: YiblhkVl2w
abstract: 'Rankings are ubiquitous across many applications, from search engines to
  hiring committees. In practice, many rankings are derived from the output of predictors.
  However, when predictors trained for classification tasks have intrinsic uncertainty,
  it is not obvious how this uncertainty should be represented in the derived rankings.
  Our work considers ranking functions: maps from individual predictions for a classification
  task to distributions over rankings. We focus on two aspects of ranking functions:
  stability to perturbations in predictions and fairness towards both individuals
  and subgroups. Not only is stability an important requirement for its own sake,
  but — as we show — it composes harmoniously with individual fairness in the sense
  of Dwork et al. (2012). While deterministic ranking functions cannot be stable aside
  from trivial scenarios, we show that the recently proposed uncertainty aware (UA)
  ranking functions of Singh et al. (2021) are stable. Our main result is that UA
  rankings also achieve group fairness through successful composition with multiaccurate
  or multicalibrated predictors. Our work demonstrates that UA rankings naturally
  interpolate between group and individual level fairness guarantees, while simultaneously
  satisfying stability guarantees important whenever machine-learned predictions are
  used.'
