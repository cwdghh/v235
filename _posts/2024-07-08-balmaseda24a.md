title: 'Combinatorial Approximations for Cluster Deletion: Simpler, Faster, and Better'
openreview: FpbKoIPHxb
abstract: Cluster deletion is an NP-hard graph clustering objective with applications
  in computational biology and social network analysis, where the goal is to delete
  a minimum number of edges to partition a graph into cliques. We first provide a
  tighter analysis of two previous approximation algorithms, improving their approximation
  guarantees from 4 to 3. Moreover, we show that both algorithms can be derandomized
  in a surprisingly simple way, by greedily taking a vertex of maximum degree in an
  auxiliary graph and forming a cluster around it. One of these algorithms relies
  on solving a linear program. Our final contribution is to design a new and purely
  combinatorial approach for doing so that is far more scalable in theory and practice.
