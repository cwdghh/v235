title: 'Position: Social Environment Design Should be Further Developed for AI-based
  Policy-Making'
openreview: S6a6gHvMWx
abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds promise as a technology that can be used
  to improve government and economic policy-making. This paper proposes a new research
  agenda towards this end by introducing <b>Social Environment Design</b>, a general
  framework for the use of AI in automated policy-making that connects with the Reinforcement
  Learning, EconCS, and Computational Social Choice communities. The framework seeks
  to capture general economic environments, includes voting on policy objectives,
  and gives a direction for the systematic analysis of government and economic policy
  through AI simulation. We highlight key open problems for future research in AI-based
  policymaking. By solving these challenges, we hope to achieve various social welfare
  objectives, thereby promoting more ethical and responsible decision making.
