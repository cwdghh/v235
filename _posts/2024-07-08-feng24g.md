title: 'Prediction Accuracy of Learning in Games : Follow-the-Regularized-Leader meets
  Heisenberg'
openreview: Y0sH9HGMwq
abstract: We investigate the accuracy of prediction in deterministic learning dynamics
  of zero-sum games with random initializations, specifically focusing on observer
  uncertainty and its relationship to the evolution of covariances. Zero-sum games
  are a prominent field of interest in machine learning due to their various applications.
  Concurrently, the accuracy of prediction in dynamical systems from mechanics has
  long been a classic subject of investigation since the discovery of the Heisenberg
  Uncertainty Principle. This principle employs covariance and standard deviation
  of particle states to measure prediction accuracy. In this study, we bring these
  two approaches together to analyze the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) algorithm
  in two-player zero-sum games. We provide growth rates of covariance information
  for continuous-time FTRL, as well as its two canonical discretization methods (Euler
  and Symplectic). A Heisenberg-type inequality is established for FTRL. Our analysis
  and experiments also show that employing Symplectic discretization enhances the
  accuracy of prediction in learning dynamics.
