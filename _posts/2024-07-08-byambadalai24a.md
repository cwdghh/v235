title: 'Estimating Distributional Treatment Effects in Randomized Experiments: Machine
  Learning for Variance Reduction'
openreview: RDofzHLuX4
abstract: We propose a novel regression adjustment method designed for estimating
  distributional treatment effect parameters in randomized experiments. Randomized
  experiments have been extensively used to estimate treatment effects in various
  scientific fields. However, to gain deeper insights, it is essential to estimate
  distributional treatment effects rather than relying solely on average effects.
  Our approach incorporates pre-treatment covariates into a distributional regression
  framework, utilizing machine learning techniques to improve the precision of distributional
  treatment effect estimators. The proposed approach can be readily implemented with
  off-the-shelf machine learning methods and remains valid as long as the nuisance
  components are reasonably well estimated. Also, we establish the asymptotic properties
  of the proposed estimator and present a uniformly valid inference method. Through
  simulation results and real data analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating
  machine learning techniques in reducing the variance of distributional treatment
  effect estimators in finite samples.
