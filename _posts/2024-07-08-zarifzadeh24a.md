title: Low-Cost High-Power Membership Inference Attacks
openreview: sT7UJh5CTc
abstract: Membership inference attacks aim to detect if a particular data point was
  used in training a model. We design a novel statistical test to perform robust membership
  inference attacks (RMIA) with low computational overhead. We achieve this by a fine-grained
  modeling of the null hypothesis in our likelihood ratio tests, and effectively leveraging
  both reference models and reference population data samples. RMIA has superior test
  power compared with prior methods, throughout the TPR-FPR curve (even at extremely
  low FPR, as low as 0). Under computational constraints, where only a limited number
  of pre-trained reference models (as few as 1) are available, and also when we vary
  other elements of the attack (e.g., data distribution), our method performs exceptionally
  well, unlike prior attacks that approach random guessing. RMIA lays the groundwork
  for practical yet accurate data privacy risk assessment in machine learning.
