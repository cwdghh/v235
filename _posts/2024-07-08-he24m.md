title: 'SFC: Achieve Accurate Fast Convolution under Low-precision Arithmetic'
openreview: fgBWtOw66T
abstract: Fast convolution algorithms, including Winograd and FFT, can efficiently
  accelerate convolution operations in deep models. However, these algorithms depend
  on high-precision arithmetic to maintain inference accuracy, which conflicts with
  the model quantization. To resolve this conflict and further improve the efficiency
  of quantized convolution, we proposes SFC, a new algebra transform for fast convolution
  by extending the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) with symbolic computing, in which
  only additions are required to perform the transformation at specific transform
  points, avoiding the calculation of irrational number and reducing the requirement
  for precision. Additionally, we enhance convolution efficiency by introducing correction
  terms to convert invalid circular convolution outputs of the Fourier method into
  effective ones. The numerical error analysis is presented for the first time in
  this type of work and proves that our algorithms can provide a 3.68× multiplication
  reduction for 3×3 convolution, while the Winograd algorithm only achieves a 2.25×
  reduction with similarly low numerical errors. Experiments carried out on benchmarks
  and FPGA show that our new algorithms can further improve the computation efficiency
  of quantized models while maintaining accuracy, surpassing both the quantization-alone
  method and existing works on fast convolution quantization.
