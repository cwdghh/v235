title: 'An Image is Worth Multiple Words: Discovering Object Level Concepts using
  Multi-Concept Prompt Learning'
openreview: F3x6uYILgL
abstract: 'Textural Inversion, a prompt learning method, learns a singular text embedding
  for a new "word" to represent image style and appearance, allowing it to be integrated
  into natural language sentences to generate novel synthesised images. However, identifying
  multiple unknown object-level concepts within one scene remains a complex challenge.
  While recent methods have resorted to cropping or masking individual images to learn
  multiple concepts, these techniques often require prior knowledge of new concepts
  and are labour-intensive. To address this challenge, we introduce <em>Multi-Concept
  Prompt Learning (MCPL)</em>, where multiple unknown "words" are simultaneously learned
  from a single sentence-image pair, without any imagery annotations. To enhance the
  accuracy of word-concept correlation and refine attention mask boundaries, we propose
  three regularisation techniques: <em>Attention Masking</em>, <em>Prompts Contrastive
  Loss</em>, and <em>Bind Adjective</em>. Extensive quantitative comparisons with
  both real-world categories and biomedical images demonstrate that our method can
  learn new semantically disentangled concepts. Our approach emphasises learning solely
  from textual embeddings, using less than 10% of the storage space compared to others.
