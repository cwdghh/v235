title: Accelerating PDE Data Generation via Differential Operator Action in Solution
  Space
openreview: Fv9GLw0LkO
abstract: Recent advancements in data-driven approaches, such as Neural Operator (NO),
  have demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing the solving time of Partial Differential
  Equations (PDEs). However, one major challenge faced by these approaches is the
  requirement for a large amount of high-precision training data, which needs significant
  computational costs during the generation process. To address this challenge, we
  propose a novel PDE dataset generation algorithm, namely <b>Diff</b>erential <b>O</b>perator
  <b>A</b>ction in <b>S</b>olution space (<b>DiffOAS</b>), which speeds up the data
  generation process and enhances the precision of the generated data simultaneously.
  Specifically, DiffOAS obtains a few basic PDE solutions and then combines them to
  get solutions. It applies differential operators on these solutions, a process we
  call ’operator action’, to efficiently generate precise PDE data points. Theoretical
  analysis shows that the time complexity of DiffOAS method is one order lower than
  the existing generation method. Experimental results show that DiffOAS accelerates
  the generation of large-scale datasets with 10,000 instances by 300 times. Even
  with just 5% of the generation time, NO trained on the data generated by DiffOAS
  exhibits comparable performance to that using the existing generation method, which
  highlights the efficiency of DiffOAS.
