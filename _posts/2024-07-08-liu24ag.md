title: Multi-Source Conformal Inference Under Distribution Shift
openreview: qmUbSAgz08
abstract: Recent years have experienced increasing utilization of complex machine
  learning models across multiple sources of data to inform more generalizable decision-making.
  However, distribution shifts across data sources and privacy concerns related to
  sharing individual-level data, coupled with a lack of uncertainty quantification
  from machine learning predictions, make it challenging to achieve valid inferences
  in multi-source environments. In this paper, we consider the problem of obtaining
  distribution-free prediction intervals for a target population, leveraging multiple
  potentially biased data sources. We derive the efficient influence functions for
  the quantiles of unobserved outcomes in the target and source populations, and show
  that one can incorporate machine learning prediction algorithms in the estimation
  of nuisance functions while still achieving parametric rates of convergence to nominal
  coverage probabilities. Moreover, when conditional outcome invariance is violated,
  we propose a data-adaptive strategy to upweight informative data sources for efficiency
  gain and downweight non-informative data sources for bias reduction. We highlight
  the robustness and efficiency of our proposals for a variety of conformal scores
  and data-generating mechanisms via extensive synthetic experiments. Hospital length
  of stay prediction intervals for pediatric patients undergoing a high-risk cardiac
  surgical procedure between 2016-2022 in the U.S. illustrate the utility of our methodology.
