title: 'HelmFluid: Learning Helmholtz Dynamics for Interpretable Fluid Prediction'
openreview: lHJFfDFbm6
abstract: Fluid prediction is a long-standing challenge due to the intrinsic high-dimensional
  non-linear dynamics. Previous methods usually utilize the non-linear modeling capability
  of deep models to directly estimate velocity fields for future prediction. However,
  skipping over inherent physical properties but directly learning superficial velocity
  fields will overwhelm the model from generating precise or physics-reliable results.
  In this paper, we propose the HelmFluid toward an accurate and interpretable predictor
  for fluid. Inspired by the Helmholtz theorem, we design a HelmDynamics block to
  learn Helmholtz dynamics, which decomposes fluid dynamics into more solvable curl-free
  and divergence-free parts, physically corresponding to potential and stream functions
  of fluid. By embedding the HelmDynamics block into a Multiscale Multihead Integral
  Architecture, HelmFluid can integrate learned Helmholtz dynamics along temporal
  dimension in multiple spatial scales to yield future fluid. Compared with previous
  velocity estimating methods, HelmFluid is faithfully derived from Helmholtz theorem
  and ravels out complex fluid dynamics with physically interpretable evidence. Experimentally,
  HelmFluid achieves consistent state-of-the-art in both numerical simulated and real-world
  observed benchmarks, even for scenarios with complex boundaries.
