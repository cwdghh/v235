title: Minimally Modifying a Markov Game to Achieve Any Nash Equilibrium and Value
openreview: ZtMqsSkIHX
abstract: We study the game modification problem, where a benevolent game designer
  or a malevolent adversary modifies the reward function of a zero-sum Markov game
  so that a target deterministic or stochastic policy profile becomes the unique Markov
  perfect Nash equilibrium and has a value within a target range, in a way that minimizes
  the modification cost. We characterize the set of policy profiles that can be installed
  as the unique equilibrium of a game and establish sufficient and necessary conditions
  for successful installation. We propose an efficient algorithm that solves a convex
  optimization problem with linear constraints and then performs random perturbation
  to obtain a modification plan with a near-optimal cost.
