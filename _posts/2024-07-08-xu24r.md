title: Robust Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning under Model Misspecification
openreview: pkUl39b0in
abstract: To solve safety-critical decision-making problems, Inverse Constrained Reinforcement
  Learning (ICRL) infers constraints from expert demonstrations and seeks to imitate
  expert preference by utilizing these constraints. While prior ICRL research commonly
  overlooks the discrepancy between the training and deploying environments, we demonstrate
  that such a discrepancy can significantly compromise the reliability of the inferred
  constraints and thus induce unsafe movements. Motivated by this finding, we propose
  the Robust Constraint Inference (RCI) problem and an Adaptively Robust ICRL (AR-ICRL)
  algorithm to solve RCI efficiently. Specifically, we model the impact of misspecified
  dynamics with an opponent policy and learn a robust policy to facilitate safe control
  in a Markov Game. Subsequently, we adjust our constraint model to align the learned
  policies to expert demonstrations, accommodating both soft and hard optimality in
  our behavioral models. Empirical results demonstrate the significance of robust
  constraints and the effectiveness of the proposed AR-ICRL algorithm under continuous
  and discrete domains. The code is available at https://github.com/Jasonxu1225/AR-ICRL.
