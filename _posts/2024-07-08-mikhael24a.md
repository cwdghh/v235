title: 'CLIPZyme: Reaction-Conditioned Virtual Screening of Enzymes'
openreview: 0mYAK6Yhhm
abstract: Computational screening of naturally occurring proteins has the potential
  to identify efficient catalysts among the hundreds of millions of sequences that
  remain uncharacterized. Current experimental methods remain time, cost and labor
  intensive, limiting the number of enzymes they can reasonably screen. In this work,
  we propose a computational framework for in-silico enzyme screening. Through a contrastive
  objective, we train CLIPZyme to encode and align representations of enzyme structures
  and reaction pairs. With no standard computational baseline, we compare CLIPZyme
  to existing EC (enzyme commission) predictors applied to virtual enzyme screening
  and show improved performance in scenarios where limited information on the reaction
  is available (BEDROC$_{85}$ of 44.69%). Additionally, we evaluate combining EC predictors
  with CLIPZyme and show its generalization capacity on both unseen reactions and
  protein clusters.
