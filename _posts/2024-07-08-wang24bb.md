title: 'Pi-DUAL: Using privileged information to distinguish clean from noisy labels'
openreview: 9oAXix8da9
abstract: Label noise is a pervasive problem in deep learning that often compromises
  the generalization performance of trained models. Recently, leveraging privileged
  information (PI) – information available only during training but not at test time
  – has emerged as an effective approach to mitigate this issue. Yet, existing PI-based
  methods have failed to consistently outperform their no-PI counterparts in terms
  of preventing overfitting to label noise. To address this deficiency, we introduce
  Pi-DUAL, an architecture designed to harness PI to distinguish clean from wrong
  labels. Pi-DUAL decomposes the output logits into a prediction term, based on conventional
  input features, and a noise-fitting term influenced solely by PI. A gating mechanism
  steered by PI adaptively shifts focus between these terms, allowing the model to
  implicitly separate the learning paths of clean and wrong labels. Empirically, Pi-DUAL
  achieves significant performance improvements on key PI benchmarks (e.g., +6.8%
  on ImageNet-PI), establishing a new state-of-the-art test set accuracy. Additionally,
  Pi-DUAL is a potent method for identifying noisy samples post-training, outperforming
  other strong methods at this task. Overall, Pi-DUAL is a simple, scalable and practical
  approach for mitigating the effects of label noise in a variety of real-world scenarios
  with PI.
