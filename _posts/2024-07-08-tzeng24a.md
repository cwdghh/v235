title: Matroid Semi-Bandits in Sublinear Time
openreview: MwQ53xAIPs
abstract: 'We study the matroid semi-bandits problem, where at each round the learner
  plays a subset of $K$ arms from a feasible set, and the goal is to maximize the
  expected cumulative linear rewards. Existing algorithms have per-round time complexity
  at least $\Omega(K)$, which becomes expensive when $K$ is large. To address this
  computational issue, we propose FasterCUCB whose sampling rule takes time sublinear
  in $K$ for common classes of matroids: $\mathcal{O}(D\text{ polylog}(K)\text{ polylog}(T))$
  for uniform matroids, partition matroids, and graphical matroids, and $\mathcal{O}(D\sqrt{K}\text{
  polylog}(T))$ for transversal matroids. Here, $D$ is the maximum number of elements
  in any feasible subset of arms, and $T$ is the horizon. Our technique is based on
  dynamic maintenance of an approximate maximum-weight basis over inner-product weights.
  Although the introduction of an approximate maximum-weight basis presents a challenge
  in regret analysis, we can still guarantee an upper bound on regret as tight as
  CUCB in the sense that it matches the gap-dependent lower bound by Kveton et al.
  (2014a) asymptotically.'
