title: 'Saliency strikes back: How filtering out high frequencies improves white-box
  explanations'
openreview: eC1OOpOGZW
abstract: Attribution methods correspond to a class of explainability methods (XAI)
  that aim to assess how individual inputs contribute to a model’s decision-making
  process. We have identified a significant limitation in one type of attribution
  methods, known as “white-box" methods. Although highly efficient, as we will show,
  these methods rely on a gradient signal that is often contaminated by high-frequency
  artifacts. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new approach called "FORGrad".
  This simple method effectively filters out these high-frequency artifacts using
  optimal cut-off frequencies tailored to the unique characteristics of each model
  architecture. Our findings show that FORGrad <em>consistently enhances</em> the
  performance of already existing white-box methods, enabling them to compete effectively
  with more accurate yet computationally demanding "black-box" methods. We anticipate
  that our research will foster broader adoption of simpler and more efficient white-box
  methods for explainability, offering a better balance between faithfulness and computational
  efficiency.
