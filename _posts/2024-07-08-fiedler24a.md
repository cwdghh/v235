title: On Statistical Learning Theory for Distributional Inputs
openreview: LGDYsBslWi
abstract: Kernel-based statistical learning on distributional inputs appears in many
  relevant applications, from medical diagnostics to causal inference, and poses intriguing
  theoretical questions. While this learning scenario received considerable attention
  from the machine learning community recently, many gaps in the theory remain. In
  particular, most works consider only the distributional regression setting, and
  focus on the regularized least-squares algorithm for this problem. In this work,
  we start to fill these gaps. We prove two oracle inequalities for kernel machines
  in general distributional learning scenarios, as well as a generalization result
  based on algorithmic stability. Our main results are formulated in great generality,
  utilizing general Hilbertian embeddings, which makes them applicable to a wide array
  of approaches to distributional learning. Additionally, we specialize our results
  to the cases of kernel mean embeddings and of the recently introduced Hilbertian
  embeddings based on sliced Wasserstein distances, providing concrete instances of
  the general setup. Our results considerably enlarge the scope of theoretically grounded
  distributional learning, and provide many interesting avenues for future work.
