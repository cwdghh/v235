title: 'Get More with LESS: Synthesizing Recurrence with KV Cache Compression for
  Efficient LLM Inference'
openreview: uhHDhVKFMW
abstract: Many computational factors limit broader deployment of large language models.
  In this paper, we focus on a memory bottleneck imposed by the key-value (KV) cache,
  a computational shortcut that requires storing previous KV pairs during decoding.
  While existing KV cache methods approach this problem by pruning or evicting large
  swaths of relatively less important KV pairs to dramatically reduce the memory footprint
  of the cache, they can have limited success in tasks that require recollecting a
  majority of previous tokens. To alleviate this issue, we propose LESS, a simple
  integration of a (nearly free) constant sized cache with eviction-based cache methods,
  such that all tokens can be queried at later decoding steps. Its ability to retain
  information throughout time shows merit on a variety of tasks where we demonstrate
  LESS can help reduce the performance gap from caching everything, sometimes even
  matching it, all while being efficient. Relevant code can be found at https://github.com/hdong920/LESS.
