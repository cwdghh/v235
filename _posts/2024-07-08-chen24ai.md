title: 'CaRiNG: Learning Temporal Causal Representation under Non-Invertible Generation
  Process'
openreview: sLZzFTMWSt
abstract: Identifying the underlying time-delayed latent causal processes in sequential
  data is vital for grasping temporal dynamics and making downstream reasoning. While
  some recent methods can robustly identify these latent causal variables, they rely
  on strict assumptions about the invertible generation process from latent variables
  to observed data. However, these assumptions are often hard to satisfy in real-world
  applications containing information loss. For instance, the visual perception process
  translates a 3D space into 2D images, or the phenomenon of persistence of vision
  incorporates historical data into current perceptions. To address this challenge,
  we establish an identifiability theory that allows for the recovery of independent
  latent components even when they come from a nonlinear and non-invertible mix. Using
  this theory as a foundation, we propose a principled approach, CaRiNG, to learn
  the Causal Representation of Non-invertible Generative temporal data with identifiability
  guarantees. Specifically, we utilize temporal context to recover lost latent information
  and apply the conditions in our theory to guide the training process. Through experiments
  conducted on synthetic datasets, we validate that our CaRiNG method reliably identifies
  the causal process, even when the generation process is non-invertible. Moreover,
  we demonstrate that our approach considerably improves temporal understanding and
  reasoning in practical applications.
