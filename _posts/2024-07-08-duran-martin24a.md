title: Outlier-robust Kalman Filtering through Generalised Bayes
openreview: D2MNVeVh5J
abstract: We derive a novel, provably robust, efficient, and closed-form Bayesian
  update rule for online filtering in state-space models in the presence of outliers
  and misspecified measurement models. Our method combines generalised Bayesian inference
  with filtering methods such as the extended and ensemble Kalman filter. We use the
  former to show robustness and the latter to ensure computational efficiency in the
  case of nonlinear models. Our method matches or outperforms other robust filtering
  methods (such as those based on variational Bayes) at a much lower computational
  cost. We show this empirically on a range of filtering problems with outlier measurements,
  such as object tracking, state estimation in high-dimensional chaotic systems, and
  online learning of neural networks.
