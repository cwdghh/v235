title: 'Sparse Model Inversion: Efficient Inversion of Vision Transformers for Data-Free
  Applications'
openreview: T0lFfO8HaK
abstract: 'Model inversion, which aims to reconstruct the original training data from
  pre-trained discriminative models, is especially useful when the original training
  data is unavailable due to privacy, usage rights, or size constraints. However,
  existing dense inversion methods attempt to reconstruct the entire image area, making
  them extremely inefficient when inverting high-resolution images from large-scale
  Vision Transformers (ViTs). We further identify two underlying causes of this inefficiency:
  the redundant inversion of noisy backgrounds and the unintended inversion of spurious
  correlations—a phenomenon we term “hallucination” in model inversion. To address
  these limitations, we propose a novel sparse model inversion strategy, as a plug-and-play
  extension to speed up existing dense inversion methods with no need for modifying
  their original loss functions. Specifically, we selectively invert semantic foregrounds
  while stopping the inversion of noisy backgrounds and potential spurious correlations.
  Through both theoretical and empirical studies, we validate the efficacy of our
  approach in achieving significant inversion acceleration (up to $\times$3.79) while
  maintaining comparable or even enhanced downstream performance in data-free model
  quantization and data-free knowledge transfer. Code is available at https://github.com/Egg-Hu/SMI.'
