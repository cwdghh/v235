title: Latent variable model for high-dimensional point process with structured missingness
openreview: g1Gf0hoPSz
abstract: Longitudinal data are important in numerous fields, such as healthcare,
  sociology and seismology, but real-world datasets present notable challenges for
  practitioners because they can be high-dimensional, contain structured missingness
  patterns, and measurement time points can be governed by an unknown stochastic process.
  While various solutions have been suggested, the majority of them have been designed
  to account for only one of these challenges. In this work, we propose a flexible
  and efficient latent-variable model that is capable of addressing all these limitations.
  Our approach utilizes Gaussian processes to capture correlations between samples
  and their associated missingness masks as well as to model the underlying point
  process. We construct our model as a variational autoencoder together with deep
  neural network parameterised decoder and encoder models, and develop a scalable
  amortised variational inference approach for efficient model training. We demonstrate
  competitive performance using both simulated and real datasets.
