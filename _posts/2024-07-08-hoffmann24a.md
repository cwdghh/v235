title: 'Eureka-Moments in Transformers: Multi-Step Tasks Reveal Softmax Induced Optimization
  Problems'
openreview: HssOwuZiaB
abstract: In this work, we study rapid improvements of the training loss in transformers
  when being confronted with multi-step decision tasks. We found that transformers
  struggle to learn the intermediate task and both training and validation loss saturate
  for hundreds of epochs. When transformers finally learn the intermediate task, they
  do this rapidly and unexpectedly. We call these abrupt improvements Eureka-moments,
  since the transformer appears to suddenly learn a previously incomprehensible concept.
  We designed synthetic tasks to study the problem in detail, but the leaps in performance
  can be observed also for language modeling and in-context learning (ICL). We suspect
  that these abrupt transitions are caused by the multi-step nature of these tasks.
  Indeed, we find connections and show that ways to improve on the synthetic multi-step
  tasks can be used to improve the training of language modeling and ICL. Using the
  synthetic data we trace the problem back to the Softmax function in the self-attention
  block of transformers and show ways to alleviate the problem. These fixes reduce
  the required number of training steps, lead to higher likelihood to learn the intermediate
  task, to higher final accuracy and training becomes more robust to hyper-parameters.
