title: Faster Streaming and Scalable Algorithms for Finding Directed Dense Subgraphs
  in Large Graphs
openreview: 6h6ovHcC9G
abstract: Finding dense subgraphs is a fundamental algorithmic tool in data mining,
  community detection, and clustering. In this problem, the aim is to find an induced
  subgraph whose edge-to-vertex ratio is maximized. We show how to find a $(2+\epsilon)$
  approximation of the directed densest subgraph on randomized streams in a single
  pass while using $O(n \cdot {\rm poly} \log n)$ memory on $n$-vertex graphs. In
  contrast, the approach by Bahmani et al. (VLDB 2012) uses $O(\log n)$ passes and
  by Esfandiari et al. (2015) makes one pass but uses $O(n^{3/2})$ memory; both algorithms
  also apply to arbitrary-ordered streams. Our techniques extend to Massively Parallel
  Computation (MPC), yielding quadratic improvement over state-of-the-art by Bahmani
  et al. (VLDB 2012 and WAW 2014). We empirically show that the quality of our output
  is essentially the same as that of Bahmani et al. (VLDB 2012) while being $2$ times
  faster on large graphs, even on non-randomly ordered streams.
