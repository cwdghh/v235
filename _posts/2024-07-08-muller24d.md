title: 'Position: Optimization in SciML Should Employ the Function Space Geometry'
openreview: MOrvoYrlOg
abstract: We provide an infinite-dimensional view on optimization problems encountered
  in scientific machine learning (SciML) and advocate for the paradigm first optimize,
  then discretize for their solution. This amounts to first choosing an appropriate
  infinite-dimensional algorithm which is then discretized in a second step. To illustrate
  this point, we discuss recently proposed state-of-the-art algorithms for SciML applications
  and see that they can be derived within this framework. Hence, this perspective
  allows for a principled guide for the design of optimization algorithms for SciML.
  As the infinite-dimensional viewpoint is presently underdeveloped we formalize it
  here to foster the development of novel optimization algorithms.
