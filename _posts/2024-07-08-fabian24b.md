title: 'DiracDiffusion: Denoising and Incremental Reconstruction with Assured Data-Consistency'
openreview: ibwxzYCep9
abstract: Diffusion models have established new state of the art in a multitude of
  computer vision tasks, including image restoration. Diffusion-based inverse problem
  solvers generate reconstructions of exceptional visual quality from heavily corrupted
  measurements. However, in what is widely known as the perception-distortion trade-off,
  the price of perceptually appealing reconstructions is often paid in declined distortion
  metrics, such as PSNR. Distortion metrics measure faithfulness to the observation,
  a crucial requirement in inverse problems. In this work, we propose a novel framework
  for inverse problem solving, namely we assume that the observation comes from a
  stochastic degradation process that gradually degrades and noises the original clean
  image. We learn to reverse the degradation process in order to recover the clean
  image. Our technique maintains consistency with the original measurement throughout
  the reverse process, and allows for great flexibility in trading off perceptual
  quality for improved distortion metrics and sampling speedup via early-stopping.
  We demonstrate the efficiency of our method on different high-resolution datasets
  and inverse problems, achieving great improvements over other state-of-the-art diffusion-based
  methods with respect to both perceptual and distortion metrics.
