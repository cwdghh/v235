title: 'Coprocessor Actor Critic: A Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Approach For
  Adaptive Brain Stimulation'
openreview: t3SEfoTaYQ
abstract: Adaptive brain stimulation can treat neurological conditions such as Parkinsonâ€™s
  disease and post-stroke motor deficits by influencing abnormal neural activity.
  Because of patient heterogeneity, each patient requires a unique stimulation policy
  to achieve optimal neural responses. Model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL) holds
  promise in learning effective policies for a variety of similar control tasks, but
  is limited in domains like brain stimulation by a need for numerous costly environment
  interactions. In this work we introduce Coprocessor Actor Critic, a novel, model-based
  reinforcement learning (MBRL) approach for learning neural coprocessor policies
  for brain stimulation. Our key insight is that coprocessor policy learning is a
  combination of learning how to act optimally in the world and learning how to induce
  optimal actions in the world through stimulation of an injured brain. We show that
  our approach overcomes the limitations of traditional MFRL methods in terms of sample
  efficiency and task success and outperforms baseline MBRL approaches in a neurologically
  realistic model of an injured brain.
