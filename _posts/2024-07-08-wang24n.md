title: Diagnosing the Compositional Knowledge of Vision Language Models from a Game-Theoretic
  View
openreview: PzjDsfYwLC
abstract: Compositional reasoning capabilities are usually considered as fundamental
  skills to characterize human perception. Recent studies show that current Vision
  Language Models (VLMs) surprisingly lack sufficient knowledge with respect to such
  capabilities. To this end, we propose to thoroughly diagnose the composition representations
  encoded by VLMs, systematically revealing the potential cause for this weakness.
  Specifically, we propose evaluation methods from a novel game-theoretic view to
  assess the vulnerability of VLMs on different aspects of compositional understanding,
  e.g., relations and attributes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate and validate
  several insights to understand the incapabilities of VLMs on compositional reasoning,
  which provide useful and reliable guidance for future studies. The deliverables
  will be updated here.
