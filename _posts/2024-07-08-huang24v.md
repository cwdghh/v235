title: Overcoming Data and Model heterogeneities in Decentralized Federated Learning
  via Synthetic Anchors
openreview: mNzkumTSVL
abstract: 'Conventional Federated Learning (FL) involves collaborative training of
  a global model while maintaining user data privacy. One of its branches, decentralized
  FL, is a serverless network that allows clients to own and optimize different local
  models separately, which results in saving management and communication resources.
  Despite the promising advancements in decentralized FL, it may reduce model generalizability
  due to lacking a global model. In this scenario, managing data and model heterogeneity
  among clients becomes a crucial problem, which poses a unique challenge that must
  be overcome: <em>How can every client’s local model learn generalizable representation
  in a decentralized manner?</em> To address this challenge, we propose a novel <b>De</b>centralized
  FL technique by introducing <b>S</b>ynthetic <b>A</b>nchors, dubbed as DeSA. Based
  on the theory of domain adaptation and Knowledge Distillation (KD), we theoretically
  and empirically show that synthesizing global anchors based on raw data distribution
  facilitates mutual knowledge transfer. We further design two effective regularization
  terms for local training: <em>1) REG loss</em> that regularizes the distribution
  of the client’s latent embedding with the anchors and <em>2) KD loss</em> that enables
  clients to learn from others. Through extensive experiments on diverse client data
  distributions, we showcase the effectiveness of DeSA in enhancing both inter- and
  intra-domain accuracy of each client. The implementation of DeSA can be found at:
