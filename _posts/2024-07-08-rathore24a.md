title: 'Challenges in Training PINNs: A Loss Landscape Perspective'
openreview: mJGiFr8jLa
abstract: This paper explores challenges in training Physics-Informed Neural Networks
  (PINNs), emphasizing the role of the loss landscape in the training process. We
  examine difficulties in minimizing the PINN loss function, particularly due to ill-conditioning
  caused by differential operators in the residual term. We compare gradient-based
  optimizers Adam, L-BFGS, and their combination Adam+L-BFGS, showing the superiority
  of Adam+L-BFGS, and introduce a novel second-order optimizer, NysNewton-CG (NNCG),
  which significantly improves PINN performance. Theoretically, our work elucidates
  the connection between ill-conditioned differential operators and ill-conditioning
  in the PINN loss and shows the benefits of combining first- and second-order optimization
  methods. Our work presents valuable insights and more powerful optimization strategies
  for training PINNs, which could improve the utility of PINNs for solving difficult
  partial differential equations.
