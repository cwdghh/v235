title: Reward Shaping for Reinforcement Learning with An Assistant Reward Agent
openreview: a3XFF0PGLU
abstract: 'Reward shaping is a promising approach to tackle the sparse-reward challenge
  of reinforcement learning by reconstructing more informative and dense rewards.
  This paper introduces a novel dual-agent reward shaping framework, composed of two
  synergistic agents: a policy agent to learn the optimal behavior and a reward agent
  to generate auxiliary reward signals. The proposed method operates as a self-learning
  approach, without reliance on expert knowledge or hand-crafted functions. By restructuring
  the rewards to capture future-oriented information, our framework effectively enhances
  the sample efficiency and convergence stability. Furthermore, the auxiliary reward
  signals facilitate the exploration of the environment in the early stage and the
  exploitation of the policy agent in the late stage, achieving a self-adaptive balance.
  We evaluate our framework on continuous control tasks with sparse and delayed rewards,
  demonstrating its robustness and superiority over existing methods.'
