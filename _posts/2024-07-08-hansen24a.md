title: Interpreting Equivariant Representations
openreview: vFk9fqXLst
abstract: 'Latent representations are extensively used for tasks like visualization,
  interpolation, or feature extraction in deep learning models. This paper demonstrates
  the importance of considering the inductive bias imposed by an equivariant model
  when using latent representations as neglecting these biases can lead to decreased
  performance in downstream tasks. We propose principles for choosing invariant projections
  of latent representations and show their effectiveness in two examples: A permutation
  equivariant variational auto-encoder for molecular graph generation, where an invariant
  projection can be designed to maintain information without loss, and for a rotation-equivariant
  representation in image classification, where random invariant projections proves
  to retain a high degree of information. In both cases, the analysis of invariant
  latent representations proves superior to their equivariant counterparts. Finally,
  we illustrate that the phenomena documented here for equivariant neural networks
  have counterparts in standard neural networks where invariance is encouraged via
  augmentation.'
