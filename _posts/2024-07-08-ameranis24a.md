title: Fast Algorithms for Hypergraph PageRank with Applications to Semi-Supervised
  Learning
openreview: sfQH4JJ4We
abstract: A fundamental approach to semi-supervised learning is to leverage the structure
  of the sample space to diffuse label information from annotated examples to unlabeled
  points. Traditional methods model the input data points as a graph and rely on fast
  algorithms for solving Laplacian systems of equations, such as those defining PageRank.
  However, previous work has demonstrated that graph-based models fail to capture
  higher-order relations, such as group membership, which are better modeled by hypergraphs.
  Unfortunately, the scalable application of hypergraph models has been hampered by
  the non-linearity of the hypergraph Laplacian. In this paper, we present highly
  scalable algorithms for hypergraph primitives, such as hypergraph PageRank vectors
  and hypergraph Laplacian systems, over general families of hypergraphs. In addition
  to giving strong theoretical guarantees, we empirically showcase the speed of our
  algorithms on benchmark instances of semi-supervised learning on categorical data.
  We exploit their generality to improve semi-supervised manifold clustering via hypergraph
  models. By providing significant speed-ups on fundamental hypergraph tasks, our
  algorithms enable the deployment of hypergraph models on a massive scale.
