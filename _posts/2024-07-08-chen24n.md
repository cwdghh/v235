title: Probabilistic Forecasting with Stochastic Interpolants and Föllmer Processes
openreview: UQYXZdca92
abstract: We propose a framework for probabilistic forecasting of dynamical systems
  based on generative modeling. Given observations of the system state over time,
  we formulate the forecasting problem as sampling from the conditional distribution
  of the future system state given its current state. To this end, we leverage the
  framework of stochastic interpolants, which facilitates the construction of a generative
  model between an arbitrary base distribution and the target. We design a fictitious,
  non-physical stochastic dynamics that takes as initial condition the current system
  state and produces as output a sample from the target conditional distribution in
  finite time and without bias. This process therefore maps a point mass centered
  at the current state onto a probabilistic ensemble of forecasts. We prove that the
  drift coefficient entering the stochastic differential equation (SDE) achieving
  this task is non-singular, and that it can be learned efficiently by square loss
  regression over the time-series data. We show that the drift and the diffusion coefficients
  of this SDE can be adjusted after training, and that a specific choice that minimizes
  the impact of the estimation error gives a Föllmer process. We highlight the utility
  of our approach on several complex, high-dimensional forecasting problems, including
  stochastically forced Navier-Stokes and video prediction on the KTH and CLEVRER
  datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/interpolants/forecasting.
