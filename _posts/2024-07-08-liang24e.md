title: Realistic Unsupervised CLIP Fine-tuning with Universal Entropy Optimization
openreview: XxCfToC9pJ
abstract: The emergence of vision-language models, such as CLIP, has spurred a significant
  research effort towards their application for downstream supervised learning tasks.
  Although some previous studies have explored the unsupervised fine-tuning of CLIP,
  they often rely on prior knowledge in the form of class names associated with ground
  truth labels. This paper explores a realistic unsupervised fine-tuning scenario,
  considering the presence of out-of-distribution samples from unknown classes within
  the unlabeled data. In particular, we focus on simultaneously enhancing out-of-distribution
  detection and the recognition of instances associated with known classes. To tackle
  this problem, we present a simple, efficient, and effective approach called Universal
  Entropy Optimization (UEO). UEO leverages sample-level confidence to approximately
  minimize the conditional entropy of confident instances and maximize the marginal
  entropy of less confident instances. Apart from optimizing the textual prompt, UEO
  incorporates optimization of channel-wise affine transformations within the visual
  branch of CLIP. Extensive experiments across 15 domains and 4 different types of
  prior knowledge validate the effectiveness of UEO compared to baseline methods.
