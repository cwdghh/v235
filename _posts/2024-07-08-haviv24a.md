title: 'Wasserstein Wormhole: Scalable Optimal Transport Distance with Transformer'
openreview: Su0qe33cWA
abstract: Optimal transport (OT) and the related Wasserstein metric ($W$) are powerful
  and ubiquitous tools for comparing distributions. However, computing pairwise Wasserstein
  distances rapidly becomes intractable as cohort size grows. An attractive alternative
  would be to find an embedding space in which pairwise Euclidean distances map to
  OT distances, akin to standard multidimensional scaling (MDS). We present Wasserstein
  Wormhole, a transformer-based autoencoder that embeds empirical distributions into
  a latent space wherein Euclidean distances approximate OT distances. Extending MDS
  theory, we show that our objective function implies a bound on the error incurred
  when embedding non-Euclidean distances. Empirically, distances between Wormhole
  embeddings closely match Wasserstein distances, enabling linear time computation
  of OT distances. Along with an encoder that maps distributions to embeddings, Wasserstein
  Wormhole includes a decoder that maps embeddings back to distributions, allowing
  for operations in the embedding space to generalize to OT spaces, such as Wasserstein
  barycenter estimation and OT interpolation. By lending scalability and interpretability
  to OT approaches, Wasserstein Wormhole unlocks new avenues for data analysis in
  the fields of computational geometry and single-cell biology.
