title: 'Feature Contamination: Neural Networks Learn Uncorrelated Features and Fail
  to Generalize'
openreview: Ljhrv1Wmbr
abstract: 'Learning representations that generalize under distribution shifts is critical
  for building robust machine learning models. However, despite significant efforts
  in recent years, algorithmic advances in this direction have been limited. In this
  work, we seek to understand the fundamental difficulty of out-of-distribution generalization
  with deep neural networks. We first empirically show that perhaps surprisingly,
  even allowing a neural network to explicitly fit the representations obtained from
  a teacher network that can generalize out-of-distribution is insufficient for the
  generalization of the student network. Then, by a theoretical study of two-layer
  ReLU networks optimized by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) under a structured
  feature model, we identify a fundamental yet unexplored feature learning proclivity
  of neural networks, feature contamination: neural networks can learn uncorrelated
  features together with predictive features, resulting in generalization failure
  under distribution shifts. Notably, this mechanism essentially differs from the
  prevailing narrative in the literature that attributes the generalization failure
  to spurious correlations. Overall, our results offer new insights into the non-linear
  feature learning dynamics of neural networks and highlight the necessity of considering
  inductive biases in out-of-distribution generalization.'
