title: 'DeCoOp: Robust Prompt Tuning with Out-of-Distribution Detection'
openreview: MoTUdh9ZCc
abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated impressive
  zero-shot capabilities for various downstream tasks. Their performance can be further
  enhanced through few-shot prompt tuning methods. However, current studies evaluate
  the performance of learned prompts separately on base and new classes. This evaluation
  lacks practicality for real-world applications since downstream tasks cannot determine
  whether the data belongs to base or new classes in advance. In this paper, we explore
  a problem setting called <b><em>O</em>*pen-world </b>P<b>rompt </b>T<b>uning<em>
  (OPT), which involves tuning prompts on base classes and evaluating on a combination
  of base and new classes. By introducing </em></b>De<b>composed </b>P<b>rompt </b>T<b>uning<em>
  framework (DePT), we theoretically demonstrate that OPT can be solved by incorporating
  out-of-distribution detection into prompt tuning, thereby enhancing the base-to-new
  discriminability. Based on DePT, we present a novel prompt tuning approach, namely,
  </em></b>De<b>composed </b>Co<b>ntext </b>Op*<em>timization</em> (DeCoOp), which
  introduces new-class detectors and sub-classifiers to further enhance the base-class
  and new-class discriminability. Experimental results on 11 benchmark datasets validate
  the effectiveness of DePT and demonstrate that DeCoOp outperforms current state-of-the-art
  methods, providing a significant 2% average accuracy improvement.
