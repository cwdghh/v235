title: Towards Interpretable Deep Local Learning with Successive Gradient Reconciliation
openreview: 1ZJLNLZIpk
abstract: Relieving the reliance of neural network training on a global back-propagation
  (BP) has emerged as a notable research topic due to the biological implausibility
  and huge memory consumption caused by BP. Among the existing solutions, local learning
  optimizes gradient-isolated modules of a neural network with local errors and has
  been proved to be effective even on large-scale datasets. However, the reconciliation
  among local errors has never been investigated. In this paper, we first theoretically
  study non-greedy layer-wise training and show that the convergence cannot be assured
  when the local gradient in a module w.r.t. its input is not reconciled with the
  local gradient in the previous module w.r.t. its output. Inspired by the theoretical
  result, we further propose a local training strategy that successively regularizes
  the gradient reconciliation between neighboring modules without breaking gradient
  isolation or introducing any learnable parameters. Our method can be integrated
  into both local-BP and BP-free settings. In experiments, we achieve significant
  performance improvements compared to previous methods. Particularly, our method
  for CNN and Transformer architectures on ImageNet is able to attain a competitive
  performance with global BP, saving more than 40% memory consumption.
