title: Sequential Kernel Goodness-of-fit Testing
openreview: bmeUeCUMHA
abstract: Goodness-of-fit testing, a classical statistical tool, has been extensively
  explored in the batch setting, where the sample size is predetermined. However,
  practitioners often prefer methods that adapt to the complexity of a problem rather
  than fixing the sample size beforehand. Classical batch tests are generally unsuitable
  for streaming data, as valid inference after data peeking requires multiple testing
  corrections, resulting in reduced statistical power. To address this issue, we delve
  into the design of consistent sequential goodness-of-fit tests. Following the principle
  of <em>testing by betting</em>, we reframe this task as selecting a sequence of
  payoff functions that maximize the wealth of a fictitious bettor, betting against
  the null in a repeated game. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the adaptability
  of our sequential test across varying difficulty levels of problems while maintaining
  control over type-I errors.
