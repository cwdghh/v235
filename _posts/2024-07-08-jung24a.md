title: Unsupervised Episode Generation for Graph Meta-learning
openreview: 9zdTOOgutk
abstract: 'We propose Unsupervised Episode Generation method called <b>Neighbors as
  Queries (NaQ)</b> to solve the Few-Shot Node-Classification (FSNC) task by <em>unsupervised
  Graph Meta-learning</em>. Doing so enables full utilization of the information of
  all nodes in a graph, which is not possible in current supervised meta-learning
  methods for FSNC due to the label-scarcity problem. In addition, unlike unsupervised
  Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) methods that overlook the downstream task to be
  solved at the training phase resulting in vulnerability to class imbalance of a
  graph, we adopt the episodic learning framework that allows the model to be aware
  of the downstream task format, i.e., FSNC. The proposed NaQ is a simple but effective
  <em>unsupervised</em> episode generation method that randomly samples nodes from
  a graph to make a support set, followed by similarity-based sampling of nodes to
  make the corresponding query set. Since NaQ is <em>model-agnostic</em>, any existing
  supervised graph meta-learning methods can be trained in an unsupervised manner,
  while not sacrificing much of their performance or sometimes even improving them.
  Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed unsupervised
  episode generation method for graph meta-learning towards the FSNC task. Our code
  is available at: https://github.com/JhngJng/NaQ-PyTorch.'
