title: How Flawed Is ECE? An Analysis via Logit Smoothing
openreview: 3McL91pE6x
abstract: 'Informally, a model is calibrated if its predictions are correct with a
  probability that matches the confidence of the prediction. By far the most common
  method in the literature for measuring calibration is the expected calibration error
  (ECE). Recent work, however, has pointed out drawbacks of ECE, such as the fact
  that it is discontinuous in the space of predictors. In this work, we ask: how fundamental
  are these issues, and what are their impacts on existing results? Towards this end,
  we completely characterize the discontinuities of ECE with respect to general probability
  measures on Polish spaces. We then use the nature of these discontinuities to motivate
  a novel <em>continuous, easily estimated</em> miscalibration metric, which we term
  <em>Logit-Smoothed ECE (LS-ECE)</em>. By comparing the ECE and LS-ECE of pre-trained
  image classification models, we show in initial experiments that binned ECE closely
  tracks LS-ECE, indicating that the theoretical pathologies of ECE may be avoidable
  in practice.'
