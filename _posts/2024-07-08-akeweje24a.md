title: Learning Mixtures of Gaussian Processes through Random Projection
openreview: J5Yg7HMy39
abstract: We propose an ensemble clustering framework to uncover latent cluster labels
  in functional data generated from a Gaussian process mixture. Our method exploits
  the fact that the projection coefficients of the functional data onto any given
  projection function follow a univariate Gaussian mixture model (GMM). By conducting
  multiple one-dimensional projections and learning a univariate GMM for each, we
  create an ensemble of GMMs. Each GMM serves as a base clustering, and applying ensemble
  clustering yields a consensus clustering. Our approach significantly reduces computational
  complexity compared to state-of-the-art methods, and we provide theoretical guarantees
  on the identifiability and learnability of Gaussian process mixtures. Extensive
  experiments on synthetic and real datasets confirm the superiority of our method
  over existing techniques.
