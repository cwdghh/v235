title: Why do Variational Autoencoders Really Promote Disentanglement?
openreview: Ao9UUaScAU
abstract: Despite not being designed for this purpose, the use of variational autoencoders
  (VAEs) has proven remarkably effective for disentangled representation learning
  (DRL). Recent research attributes this success to certain characteristics of the
  loss function that prevent latent space rotation, or hypothesize about the orthogonality
  properties of the decoder by drawing parallels with principal component analysis
  (PCA). This hypothesis, however, has only been tested experimentally for linear
  VAEs, and the theoretical justification still remains an open problem. Moreover,
  since real-world VAEs are often inherently non-linear due to the use of neural architectures,
  understanding DRL capabilities of real-world VAEs remains a critical task. Our work
  takes a step towards understanding disentanglement in real-world VAEs to theoretically
  establish how the orthogonality properties of the decoder promotes disentanglement
  in practical applications. Complementary to our theoretical contributions, our experimental
  results corroborate our analysis. Code is available at https://github.com/criticalml-uw/Disentanglement-in-VAE.
