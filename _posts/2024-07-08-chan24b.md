title: Scribble-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Prototype-based Feature Augmentation
openreview: Q8uJyOwOsd
abstract: Scribble-supervised semantic segmentation presents a cost-effective training
  method that utilizes annotations generated through scribbling. It is valued in attaining
  high performance while minimizing annotation costs, which has made it highly regarded
  among researchers. Scribble supervision propagates information from labeled pixels
  to the surrounding unlabeled pixels, enabling semantic segmentation for the entire
  image. However, existing methods often ignore the features of classified pixels
  during feature propagation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a
  prototype-based feature augmentation method that leverages feature prototypes to
  augment scribble supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
  achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset in scribble-supervised
  semantic segmentation tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/TranquilChan/PFA.
