title: Diffusion Models Encode the Intrinsic Dimension of Data Manifolds
openreview: a0XiA6v256
abstract: In this work, we provide a mathematical proof that diffusion models encode
  data manifolds by approximating their normal bundles. Based on this observation
  we propose a novel method for extracting the intrinsic dimension of the data manifold
  from a trained diffusion model. Our insights are based on the fact that a diffusion
  model approximates the score function i.e. the gradient of the log density of a
  noise-corrupted version of the target distribution for varying levels of corruption.
  We prove that as the level of corruption decreases, the score function points towards
  the manifold, as this direction becomes the direction of maximal likelihood increase.
  Therefore, at low noise levels, the diffusion model provides us with an approximation
  of the manifold’s normal bundle, allowing for an estimation of the manifold’s intrinsic
  dimension. To the best of our knowledge our method is the first estimator of intrinsic
  dimension based on diffusion models and it outperforms well established estimators
  in controlled experiments on both Euclidean and image data.
