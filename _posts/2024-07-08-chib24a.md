title: 'MS-TIP: Imputation Aware Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction'
openreview: s4Hy0L4mml
abstract: Pedestrian trajectory prediction aims to predict future trajectories based
  on observed trajectories. Current state-of-the-art methods often assume that the
  observed sequences of agents are complete, which is a strong assumption that overlooks
  inherent uncertainties. Understanding pedestrian behavior when dealing with missing
  values in the observed sequence is crucial for enhancing the performance of predictive
  models. In this work, we propose the MultiScale hypergraph for Trajectory Imputation
  and Prediction (MS-TIP), a novel approach that simultaneously addresses the imputation
  of missing observations and the prediction of future trajectories. Specifically,
  we leverage transformers with diagonal masked self-attention to impute incomplete
  observations. Further, our approach promotes complex interaction modeling through
  multi-scale hypergraphs, optimizing our trajectory prediction module to capture
  different types of interactions. With the inclusion of scenic attention, we learn
  contextual scene information, instead of sole reliance on coordinates. Additionally,
  our approach utilizes an intermediate control point and refinement module to infer
  future trajectories accurately. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of MS-TIP
  in precisely predicting pedestrian future trajectories. Code is publicly available
