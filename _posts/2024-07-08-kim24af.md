title: 'Transformers Learn Nonlinear Features In Context: Nonconvex Mean-field Dynamics
  on the Attention Landscape'
openreview: xm2lU7tteQ
abstract: Large language models based on the Transformer architecture have demonstrated
  impressive capabilities to learn in context. However, existing theoretical studies
  on how this phenomenon arises are limited to the dynamics of a single layer of attention
  trained on linear regression tasks. In this paper, we study the optimization of
  a Transformer consisting of a fully connected layer followed by a linear attention
  layer. The MLP acts as a common nonlinear representation or feature map, greatly
  enhancing the power of in-context learning. We prove in the mean-field and two-timescale
  limit that the infinite-dimensional loss landscape for the distribution of parameters,
  while highly nonconvex, becomes quite benign. We also analyze the second-order stability
  of mean-field dynamics and show that Wasserstein gradient flow almost always avoids
  saddle points. Furthermore, we establish novel methods for obtaining concrete improvement
  rates both away from and near critical points. This represents the first saddle
  point analysis of mean-field dynamics in general and the techniques are of independent
  interest.
