title: Graph Geometry-Preserving Autoencoders
openreview: acTLXagzqd
abstract: When using an autoencoder to learn the low-dimensional manifold of high-dimensional
  data, it is crucial to find the latent representations that preserve the geometry
  of the data manifold. However, most existing studies assume a Euclidean nature for
  the high-dimensional data space, which is arbitrary and often does not precisely
  reflect the underlying semantic or domain-specific attributes of the data. In this
  paper, we propose a novel autoencoder regularization framework based on the premise
  that the geometry of the data manifold can often be better captured with a well-designed
  similarity graph associated with data points. Given such a graph, we utilize a Riemannian
  geometric distortion measure as a regularizer to preserve the geometry derived from
  the graph Laplacian and make it suitable for larger-scale autoencoder training.
  Through extensive experiments, we show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
  geometry-preserving and graph-based autoencoders with respect to learning accurate
  latent structures that preserve the graph geometry, and is particularly effective
  in learning dynamics in the latent space. Code is available at https://github.com/JungbinLim/GGAE-public.
