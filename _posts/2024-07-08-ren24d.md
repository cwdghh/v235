title: Rejuvenating image-GPT as Strong Visual Representation Learners
openreview: mzGtunvpJH
abstract: 'This paper enhances image-GPT (iGPT), one of the pioneering works that
  introduce autoregressive pretraining to predict the next pixels for visual representation
  learning. Two simple yet essential changes are made. First, we shift the prediction
  target from raw pixels to semantic tokens, enabling a higher-level understanding
  of visual content. Second, we supplement the autoregressive modeling by instructing
  the model to predict not only the next tokens but also the visible tokens. This
  pipeline is particularly effective when semantic tokens are encoded by discriminatively
  trained models, such as CLIP. We introduce this novel approach as D-iGPT. Extensive
  experiments showcase that D-iGPT excels as a strong learner of visual representations:
  A notable achievement is its compelling performance on the ImageNet-1K dataset â€”
  by training on publicly available datasets, D-iGPT unprecedentedly achieves <b>90.0%</b>
  top-1 accuracy with a vanilla ViT-H. Additionally, D-iGPT shows strong generalization
  on the downstream task. Code is available at https://github.com/OliverRensu/D-iGPT.'
