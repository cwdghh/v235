title: Neural Image Compression with Text-guided Encoding for both Pixel-level and
  Perceptual Fidelity
openreview: u8TZ9gm4im
abstract: Recent advances in text-guided image compression have shown great potential
  to enhance the perceptual quality of reconstructed images. These methods, however,
  tend to have significantly degraded pixel-wise fidelity, limiting their practicality.
  To fill this gap, we develop a new text-guided image compression algorithm that
  achieves both high perceptual and pixel-wise fidelity. In particular, we propose
  a compression framework that leverages text information mainly by text-adaptive
  encoding and training with joint image-text loss. By doing so, we avoid decoding
  based on text-guided generative models—known for high generative diversity—and effectively
  utilize the semantic information of text at a global level. Experimental results
  on various datasets show that our method can achieve high pixel-level and perceptual
  quality, with either human- or machine-generated captions. In particular, our method
  outperforms all baselines in terms of LPIPS, with some room for even more improvements
  when we use more carefully generated captions.
