title: Neural Jump-Diffusion Temporal Point Processes
openreview: d1P6GtRzuV
abstract: We present a novel perspective on temporal point processes (TPPs) by reformulating
  their intensity processes as solutions to stochastic differential equations (SDEs).
  In particular, we first prove the equivalent SDE formulations of several classical
  TPPs, including Poisson processes, Hawkes processes, and self-correcting processes.
  Based on these proofs, we introduce a unified TPP framework called Neural Jump-Diffusion
  Temporal Point Process (NJDTPP), whose intensity process is governed by a neural
  jump-diffusion SDE (NJDSDE) where the drift, diffusion, and jump coefficient functions
  are parameterized by neural networks. Compared to previous works, NJDTPP exhibits
  model flexibility in capturing intensity dynamics without relying on any specific
  functional form, and provides theoretical guarantees regarding the existence and
  uniqueness of the solution to the proposed NJDSDE. Experiments on both synthetic
  and real-world datasets demonstrate that NJDTPP is capable of capturing the dynamics
  of intensity processes in different scenarios and significantly outperforms the
  state-of-the-art TPP models in prediction tasks.
