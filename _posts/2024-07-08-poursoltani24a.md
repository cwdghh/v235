title: Robust Data-driven Prescriptiveness Optimization
openreview: bNgAdyv7ZP
abstract: The abundance of data has led to the emergence of a variety of optimization
  techniques that attempt to leverage available side information to provide more anticipative
  decisions. The wide range of methods and contexts of application have motivated
  the design of a universal unitless measure of performance known as the coefficient
  of prescriptiveness. This coefficient was designed to quantify both the quality
  of contextual decisions compared to a reference one and the prescriptive power of
  side information. To identify policies that maximize the former in a data-driven
  context, this paper introduces a distributionally robust contextual optimization
  model where the coefficient of prescriptiveness substitutes for the classical empirical
  risk minimization objective. We present a bisection algorithm to solve this model,
  which relies on solving a series of linear programs when the distributional ambiguity
  set has an appropriate nested form and polyhedral structure. Studying a contextual
  shortest path problem, we evaluate the robustness of the resulting policies against
  alternative methods when the out-of-sample dataset is subject to varying amounts
  of distribution shift.
