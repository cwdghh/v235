title: Risk-Sensitive Reward-Free Reinforcement Learning with CVaR
openreview: XGq30hC5MW
abstract: 'Exploration is a crucial phase in reinforcement learning (RL). The reward-free
  RL paradigm, as explored by (Jin et al., 2020), offers an efficient method to design
  exploration algorithms for risk-neutral RL across various reward functions with
  a single exploration phase. However, as RL applications in safety critical settings
  grow, thereâ€™s an increasing need for risk-sensitive RL, which considers potential
  risks in decision-making. Yet, efficient exploration strategies for risk-sensitive
  RL remain underdeveloped. This study presents a novel risk-sensitive reward-free
  framework based on Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), designed to effectively address
  CVaR RL for any given reward function through a single exploration phase. We introduce
  the CVaR-RF-UCRL algorithm, which is shown to be $(\epsilon,p)$-PAC, with a sample
  complexity upper bounded by $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{S^2AH^4}{\epsilon^2\tau^2}\right)$
  with $\tau$ being the risk tolerance parameter. We also prove a $\Omega\left(\frac{S^2AH^2}{\epsilon^2\tau}\right)$
  lower bound for any CVaR-RF exploration algorithm, demonstrating the near-optimality
  of our algorithm. Additionally, we propose the planning algorithms: CVaR-VI and
  its more practical variant, CVaR-VI-DISC. The effectiveness and practicality of
  our CVaR reward-free approach are further validated through numerical experiments.'
