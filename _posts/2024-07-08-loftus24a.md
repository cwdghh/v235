title: 'Position: The Causal Revolution Needs Scientific Pragmatism'
openreview: dBMLtuKH01
abstract: Causal models and methods have great promise, but their progress has been
  stalled. Proposals using causality get squeezed between two opposing worldviews.
  Scientific perfectionism–an insistence on only using “correct” models–slows the
  adoption of causal methods in knowledge generating applications. Pushing in the
  opposite direction, the academic discipline of computer science prefers algorithms
  with no or few assumptions, and technologies based on automation and scalability
  are often selected for economic and business applications. We argue that these system-centric
  inductive biases should be replaced with a human-centric philosophy we refer to
  as scientific pragmatism. The machine learning community must strike the right balance
  to make space for the causal revolution to prosper.
