title: Stacking Deep Set Networks and Pooling by Quantiles
openreview: Lgq1E92h1U
abstract: We propose Stacked Deep Sets and Quantile Pooling for learning tasks on
  set data. We introduce Quantile Pooling, a novel permutation-invariant pooling operation
  that synergizes max and average pooling. Just like max pooling, quantile pooling
  emphasizes the most salient features of the data. Like average pooling, it captures
  the overall distribution and subtle features of the data. Like both, it is lightweight
  and fast. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a variety of tasks,
  showing that quantile pooling can outperform both max and average pooling in each
  of their respective strengths. We also introduce a variant of deep set networks
  that is more expressive and universal. While Quantile Pooling balances robustness
  and sensitivity, Stacked Deep Sets enhances learning with depth.
