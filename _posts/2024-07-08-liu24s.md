title: 'DIDI: Diffusion-Guided Diversity for Offline Behavioral Generation'
openreview: 8296yUBoXr
abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach called DIffusion-guided DIversity
  (DIDI) for offline behavioral generation. The goal of DIDI is to learn a diverse
  set of skills from a mixture of label-free offline data. We achieve this by leveraging
  diffusion probabilistic models as priors to guide the learning process and regularize
  the policy. By optimizing a joint objective that incorporates diversity and diffusion-guided
  regularization, we encourage the emergence of diverse behaviors while maintaining
  the similarity to the offline data. Experimental results in four decision-making
  domains (Push, Kitchen, Humanoid, and D4RL tasks) show that DIDI is effective in
  discovering diverse and discriminative skills. We also introduce skill stitching
  and skill interpolation, which highlight the generalist nature of the learned skill
  space. Further, by incorporating an extrinsic reward function, DIDI enables reward-guided
  behavior generation, facilitating the learning of diverse and optimal behaviors
  from sub-optimal data.
