title: 'DiffAug: Enhance Unsupervised Contrastive Learning with Domain-Knowledge-Free
  Diffusion-based Data Augmentation'
openreview: s0UDX7Kswl
abstract: Unsupervised Contrastive learning has gained prominence in fields such as
  vision, and biology, leveraging predefined positive/negative samples for representation
  learning. Data augmentation, categorized into hand-designed and model-based methods,
  has been identified as a crucial component for enhancing contrastive learning. However,
  hand-designed methods require human expertise in domain-specific data while sometimes
  distorting the meaning of the data. In contrast, generative model-based approaches
  usually require supervised or large-scale external data, which has become a bottleneck
  constraining model training in many domains. To address the problems presented above,
  this paper proposes DiffAug, a novel unsupervised contrastive learning technique
  with diffusion mode-based positive data generation. DiffAug consists of a semantic
  encoder and a conditional diffusion model; the conditional diffusion model generates
  new positive samples conditioned on the semantic encoding to serve the training
  of unsupervised contrast learning. With the help of iterative training of the semantic
  encoder and diffusion model, DiffAug improves the representation ability in an uninterrupted
  and unsupervised manner. Experimental evaluations show that DiffAug outperforms
  hand-designed and SOTA model-based augmentation methods on DNA sequence, visual,
  and bio-feature datasets. The code for review is released at DiffAug CODE.
