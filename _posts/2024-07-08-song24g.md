title: Unveiling the Dynamics of Information Interplay in Supervised Learning
openreview: 5hfvLBgnNE
abstract: In this paper, we use matrix information theory as an analytical tool to
  analyze the dynamics of the information interplay between data representations and
  classification head vectors in the supervised learning process. Specifically, inspired
  by the theory of Neural Collapse, we introduce matrix mutual information ratio (MIR)
  and matrix entropy difference ratio (HDR) to assess the interactions of data representation
  and class classification heads in supervised learning, and we determine the theoretical
  optimal values for MIR and HDR when Neural Collapse happens. Our experiments show
  that MIR and HDR can effectively explain many phenomena occurring in neural networks,
  for example, the standard supervised training dynamics, linear mode connectivity,
  and the performance of label smoothing and pruning. Additionally, we use MIR and
  HDR to gain insights into the dynamics of grokking, which is an intriguing phenomenon
  observed in supervised training, where the model demonstrates generalization capabilities
  long after it has learned to fit the training data. Furthermore, we introduce MIR
  and HDR as loss terms in supervised and semi-supervised learning to optimize the
  information interactions among samples and classification heads. The empirical results
  provide evidence of the methodâ€™s effectiveness, demonstrating that the utilization
  of MIR and HDR not only aids in comprehending the dynamics throughout the training
  process but can also enhances the training procedure itself.
