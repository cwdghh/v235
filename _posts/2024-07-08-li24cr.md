title: 'DecisionNCE: Embodied Multimodal Representations via Implicit Preference Learning'
openreview: 1sesUtOIH5
abstract: 'Multimodal pretraining is an effective strategy for the trinity of goals
  of representation learning in autonomous robots: $1)$ extracting both local and
  global task progressions; $2)$ enforcing temporal consistency of visual representation;
  $3)$ capturing trajectory-level language grounding. Most existing methods approach
  these via separate objectives, which often reach sub-optimal solutions. In this
  paper, we propose a universal unified objective that can simultaneously extract
  meaningful task progression information from image sequences and seamlessly align
  them with language instructions. We discover that via implicit preferences, where
  a visual trajectory inherently aligns better with its corresponding language instruction
  than mismatched pairs, the popular Bradley-Terry model can transform into representation
  learning through proper reward reparameterizations. The resulted framework, DecisionNCE,
  mirrors an InfoNCE-style objective but is distinctively tailored for decision-making
  tasks, providing an embodied representation learning framework that elegantly extracts
  both local and global task progression features, with temporal consistency enforced
  through implicit time contrastive learning, while ensuring trajectory-level instruction
  grounding via multimodal joint encoding. Evaluation on both simulated and real robots
  demonstrates that DecisionNCE effectively facilitates diverse downstream policy
  learning tasks, offering a versatile solution for unified representation and reward
  learning. Project Page: https://2toinf.github.io/DecisionNCE/'
