title: Enhancing Sufficient Dimension Reduction via Hellinger Correlation
openreview: DN7uk4gQ7C
abstract: In this work, we develop a new theory and method for sufficient dimension
  reduction (SDR) in single-index models, where SDR is a sub-field of supervised dimension
  reduction based on conditional independence. Our work is primarily motivated by
  the recent introduction of the Hellinger correlation as a dependency measure. Utilizing
  this measure, we have developed a method capable of effectively detecting the dimension
  reduction subspace, complete with theoretical justification. Through extensive numerical
  experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances and
  outperforms existing SDR methods. This improvement is largely attributed to our
  proposed methodâ€™s deeper understanding of data dependencies and the refinement of
  existing SDR techniques.
