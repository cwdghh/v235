title: Data-Efficient Molecular Generation with Hierarchical Textual Inversion
openreview: 8KeD4mEh3j
abstract: Developing an effective molecular generation framework even with a limited
  number of molecules is often important for its practical deployment, e.g., drug
  discovery, since acquiring task-related molecular data requires expensive and time-consuming
  experimental costs. To tackle this issue, we introduce Hierarchical Textual Inversion
  for Molecular Generation (HI-Mol), a novel data-efficient molecular generation method.
  HI-Mol is inspired by the importance of hierarchical information, e.g., both coarse-
  and fine-grained features, in understanding the molecule distribution. We propose
  to use multi-level embeddings to reflect such hierarchical features based on the
  adoption of the recent textual inversion technique in the visual domain, which achieves
  data-efficient image generation. Compared to the conventional textual inversion
  method in the image domain using a single-level token embedding, our multi-level
  token embeddings allow the model to effectively learn the underlying low-shot molecule
  distribution. We then generate molecules based on the interpolation of the multi-level
  token embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of HI-Mol with
  notable data-efficiency. For instance, on QM9, HI-Mol outperforms the prior state-of-the-art
  method with 50x less training data. We also show the effectiveness of molecules
  generated by HI-Mol in low-shot molecular property prediction. Code is available
