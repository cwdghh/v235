title: A Bayesian Approach to Online Planning
openreview: NS8z5FinYl
abstract: The combination of Monte Carlo tree search and neural networks has revolutionized
  online planning. As neural network approximations are often imperfect, we ask whether
  uncertainty estimates about the network outputs could be used to improve planning.
  We develop a Bayesian planning approach that facilitates such uncertainty quantification,
  inspired by classical ideas from the meta-reasoning literature. We propose a Thompson
  sampling based algorithm for searching the tree of possible actions, for which we
  prove the first (to our knowledge) finite time Bayesian regret bound, and propose
  an efficient implementation for a restricted family of posterior distributions.
  In addition we propose a variant of the Bayes-UCB method applied to trees. Empirically,
  we demonstrate that on the ProcGen Maze and Leaper environments, when the uncertainty
  estimates are accurate but the neural network output is inaccurate, our Bayesian
  approach searches the tree much more effectively. In addition, we investigate whether
  popular uncertainty estimation methods are accurate enough to yield significant
  gains in planning.
