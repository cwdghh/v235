title: An Interpretable Evaluation of Entropy-based Novelty of Generative Models
openreview: wUgTnf918v
abstract: 'The massive developments of generative model frameworks require principled
  methods for the evaluation of a model’s novelty compared to a reference dataset.
  While the literature has extensively studied the evaluation of the quality, diversity,
  and generalizability of generative models, the assessment of a model’s novelty compared
  to a reference model has not been adequately explored in the machine learning community.
  In this work, we focus on the novelty assessment for multi-modal distributions and
  attempt to address the following differential clustering task: Given samples of
  a generative model $P_\mathcal{G}$ and a reference model $P_\mathrm{ref}$, how can
  we discover the sample types expressed by $P_\mathcal{G}$ more frequently than in
  $P_\mathrm{ref}$? We introduce a spectral approach to the differential clustering
  task and propose the Kernel-based Entropic Novelty (KEN) score to quantify the mode-based
  novelty of $P_\mathcal{G}$ with respect to $P_\mathrm{ref}$. We analyze the KEN
  score for mixture distributions with well-separable components and develop a kernel-based
  method to compute the KEN score from empirical data. We support the KEN framework
  by presenting numerical results on synthetic and real image datasets, indicating
  the framework’s effectiveness in detecting novel modes and comparing generative
  models. The paper’s code is available at: github.com/buyeah1109/KEN.'
