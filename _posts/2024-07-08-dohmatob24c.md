title: 'Precise Accuracy / Robustness Tradeoffs in Regression: Case of General Norms'
openreview: btYeH65fI3
abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of test-time adversarial attacks
  on linear regression models and determine the optimal level of robustness that any
  model can reach while maintaining a given level of standard predictive performance
  (accuracy). Through quantitative estimates, we uncover fundamental tradeoffs between
  adversarial robustness and accuracy in different regimes. We obtain a precise characterization
  which distinguishes between regimes where robustness is achievable without hurting
  standard accuracy and regimes where a tradeoff might be unavoidable. Our findings
  are empirically confirmed with simple experiments that represent a variety of settings.
  This work covers feature covariance matrices and attack norms of any nature, extending
  previous works in this area.
