title: Sliced Wasserstein with Random-Path Projecting Directions
openreview: XyxuhLtFA2
abstract: Slicing distribution selection has been used as an effective technique to
  improve the performance of parameter estimators based on minimizing sliced Wasserstein
  distance in applications. Previous works either utilize expensive optimization to
  select the slicing distribution or use slicing distributions that require expensive
  sampling methods. In this work, we propose an optimization-free slicing distribution
  that provides a fast sampling for the Monte Carlo estimation of expectation. In
  particular, we introduce the random-path projecting direction (RPD) which is constructed
  by leveraging the normalized difference between two random vectors following the
  two input measures. From the RPD, we derive the random-path slicing distribution
  (RPSD) and two variants of sliced Wasserstein, i.e., the Random-Path Projection
  Sliced Wasserstein (RPSW) and the Importance Weighted Random-Path Projection Sliced
  Wasserstein (IWRPSW). We then discuss the topological, statistical, and computational
  properties of RPSW and IWRPSW. Finally, we showcase the favorable performance of
  RPSW and IWRPSW in gradient flow and the training of denoising diffusion generative
  models on images.
