title: 'SyCoCa: Symmetrizing Contrastive Captioners with Attentive Masking for Multimodal
  Alignment'
openreview: jWHU4b7Yk6
abstract: Multimodal alignment between language and vision is the fundamental topic
  in current vision-language model research. Contrastive Captioners (CoCa), as a representative
  method, integrates Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) and Image Caption
  (IC) into a unified framework, resulting in impressive results. CLIP imposes a bidirectional
  constraints on global representations of entire images and sentences. Although IC
  conducts an unidirectional image-to-text generation on local representation, it
  lacks any constraint on local text-to-image reconstruction, which limits the ability
  to understand images at a fine-grained level when aligned with texts. To achieve
  multimodal alignment from both global and local perspectives, this paper proposes
  Symmetrizing Contrastive Captioners (SyCoCa), which introduces bidirectional interactions
  on images and texts across the global and local representation levels. Specifically,
  we expand a Text-Guided Masked Image Modeling (TG-MIM) head based on ITC and IC
  heads. The improved SyCoCa further leverages textual cues to reconstruct contextual
  images and visual cues to predict textual contents. When implementing bidirectional
  local interactions, the local contents of images tend to be cluttered or unrelated
  to their textual descriptions. Thus, we employ an attentive masking strategy to
  select effective image patches for interaction. Extensive experiments on five vision-language
  tasks, including image-text retrieval, image-captioning, visual question answering,
  and zero-shot/finetuned image classification, validate the effectiveness of our
  proposed method.
