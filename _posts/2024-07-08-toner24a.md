title: An Analysis of Linear Time Series Forecasting Models
openreview: xl82CcbYaT
abstract: Despite their simplicity, linear models perform well at time series forecasting,
  even when pitted against deeper and more expensive models. A number of variations
  to the linear model have been proposed, often including some form of feature normalisation
  that improves model generalisation. In this paper we analyse the sets of functions
  expressible using these linear model architectures. In so doing we show that several
  popular variants of linear models for time series forecasting are equivalent and
  functionally indistinguishable from standard, unconstrained linear regression. We
  characterise the model classes for each linear variant. We demonstrate that each
  model can be reinterpreted as unconstrained linear regression over a suitably augmented
  feature set, and therefore admit closed-form solutions when using a mean-squared
  loss function. We provide experimental evidence that the models under inspection
  learn nearly identical solutions, and finally demonstrate that the simpler closed
  form solutions are superior forecasters across 72% dataset-horizon settings.
