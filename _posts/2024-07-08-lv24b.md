title: Contamination-Resilient Anomaly Detection via Adversarial Learning on Partially-Observed
  Normal and Anomalous Data
openreview: 6PTiCmGcNx
abstract: Many existing anomaly detection methods assume the availability of a large-scale
  normal dataset. But for many applications, limited by resources, removing all anomalous
  samples from a large un-labeled dataset is unrealistic, resulting in contaminated
  datasets. To detect anomalies accurately under such scenarios, from the probabilistic
  perspective, the key question becomes how to learn the normal-data distribution
  from a contaminated dataset. To this end, we propose to collect two additional small
  datasets that are comprised of partially-observed normal and anomaly samples, and
  then use them to help learn the distribution under an adversarial learning scheme.
  We prove that under some mild conditions, the proposed method is able to learn the
  correct normal-data distribution. Then, we consider the overfitting issue caused
  by the small size of the two additional datasets, and a correctness-guaranteed flipping
  mechanism is further developed to alleviate it. Theoretical results under incomplete
  observed anomaly types are also presented. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
  that our method outperforms representative baselines when detecting anomalies under
  contaminated datasets.
