title: 'ExCP: Extreme LLM Checkpoint Compression via Weight-Momentum Joint Shrinking'
openreview: hlvKd7Vdxm
abstract: Large language models (LLM) have recently attracted significant attention
  in the field of artificial intelligence. However, the training process of these
  models poses significant challenges in terms of computational and storage capacities,
  thus compressing checkpoints has become an urgent problem. In this paper, we propose
  a novel Extreme Checkpoint Compression (ExCP) framework, which significantly reduces
  the required storage of training checkpoints while achieving nearly lossless performance.
  We first calculate the residuals of adjacent checkpoints to obtain the essential
  but sparse information for higher compression ratio. To further excavate the redundancy
  parameters in checkpoints, we then propose a weight-momentum joint shrinking method
  to utilize another important information during the model optimization, i.e., momentum.
  In particular, we exploit the information of both model and optimizer to discard
  as many parameters as possible while preserving critical information to ensure optimal
  performance. Furthermore, we utilize non-uniform quantization to further compress
  the storage of checkpoints. We extensively evaluate our proposed ExCP framework
  on several models ranging from 410M to 7B parameters and demonstrate significant
  storage reduction while maintaining strong performance. For instance, we achieve
  approximately $70\times$ compression for the Pythia-410M model, with the final performance
  being as accurate as the original model on various downstream tasks. Codes will
  be available at https://github.com/Gaffey/ExCP.
