title: 'CATS: Enhancing Multivariate Time Series Forecasting by Constructing Auxiliary
  Time Series as Exogenous Variables'
openreview: 1lDAGDe0UR
abstract: For Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF), recent deep learning applications
  show that univariate models frequently outperform multivariate ones. To address
  the deficiency in multivariate models, we introduce a method to Construct Auxiliary
  Time Series (CATS) that functions like a 2D temporal-contextual attention mechanism,
  which generates Auxiliary Time Series (ATS) from Original Time Series (OTS) to effectively
  represent and incorporate inter-series relationships for forecasting. Key principles
  of ATS—continuity, sparsity, and variability—are identified and implemented through
  different modules. Even with a basic 2-layer MLP as the core predictor, CATS achieves
  state-of-the-art, significantly reducing complexity and parameters compared to previous
  multivariate models, marking it as an efficient and transferable MTSF solution.
