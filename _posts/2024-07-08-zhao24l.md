title: Quantum Implicit Neural Representations
openreview: 50vc4HBuKU
abstract: Implicit neural representations have emerged as a powerful paradigm to represent
  signals such as images and sounds. This approach aims to utilize neural networks
  to parameterize the implicit function of the signal. However, when representing
  implicit functions, traditional neural networks such as ReLU-based multilayer perceptrons
  face challenges in accurately modeling high-frequency components of signals. Recent
  research has begun to explore the use of Fourier Neural Networks (FNNs) to overcome
  this limitation. In this paper, we propose Quantum Implicit Representation Network
  (QIREN), a novel quantum generalization of FNNs. Furthermore, through theoretical
  analysis, we demonstrate that QIREN possesses a quantum advantage over classical
  FNNs. Lastly, we conducted experiments in signal representation, image superresolution,
  and image generation tasks to show the superior performance of QIREN compared to
  state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Our work not only incorporates quantum advantages
  into implicit neural representations but also uncovers a promising application direction
  for Quantum Neural Networks.
