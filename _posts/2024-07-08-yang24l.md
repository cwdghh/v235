title: Small-loss Adaptive Regret for Online Convex Optimization
openreview: gDQuupz8mm
abstract: To deal with changing environments, adaptive regret has been proposed to
  minimize the regret over every interval. Previous studies have established a small-loss
  adaptive regret bound for general convex functions under the smoothness condition,
  offering the advantage of being much tighter than minimax rates for benign problems.
  However, it remains unclear whether similar bounds are attainable for other types
  of convex functions, such as exp-concave and strongly convex functions. In this
  paper, we first propose a novel algorithm that achieves a small-loss adaptive regret
  bound for exp-concave and smooth function. Subsequently, to address the limitation
  that existing algorithms can only handle one type of convex functions, we further
  design a universal algorithm capable of delivering small-loss adaptive regret bounds
  for general convex, exp-concave, and strongly convex functions simultaneously. That
  is challenging because the universal algorithm follows the meta-expert framework,
  and we need to ensure that upper bounds for both meta-regret and expert-regret are
  of small-loss types. Moreover, we provide a novel analysis demonstrating that our
  algorithms are also equipped with minimax adaptive regret bounds when functions
  are non-smooth.
