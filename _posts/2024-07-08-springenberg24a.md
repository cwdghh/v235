title: Offline Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning Scales to Large Models
openreview: tl2qmO5kpD
abstract: 'We show that offline actor-critic reinforcement learning can scale to large
  models - such as transformers - and follows similar scaling laws as supervised learning.
  We find that offline actor-critic algorithms can outperform strong, supervised,
  behavioral cloning baselines for multi-task training on a large dataset; containing
  both sub-optimal and expert behavior on 132 continuous control tasks. We introduce
  a Perceiver-based actor-critic model and elucidate the key features needed to make
  offline RL work with self- and cross-attention modules. Overall, we find that: i)
  simple offline actor critic algorithms are a natural choice for gradually moving
  away from the currently predominant paradigm of behavioral cloning, and ii) via
  offline RL it is possible to learn multi-task policies that master many domains
  simultaneously, including real robotics tasks, from sub-optimal demonstrations or
  self-generated data.'
