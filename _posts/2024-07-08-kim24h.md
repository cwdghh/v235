title: 'ODIM: Outlier Detection via Likelihood of Under-Fitted Generative Models'
openreview: R8nbccD7kv
abstract: The unsupervised outlier detection (UOD) problem refers to a task to identify
  inliers given training data which contain outliers as well as inliers, without any
  labeled information about inliers and outliers. It has been widely recognized that
  using fully-trained likelihood-based deep generative models (DGMs) often results
  in poor performance in distinguishing inliers from outliers. In this study, we claim
  that the likelihood itself could serve as powerful evidence for identifying inliers
  in UOD tasks, provided that DGMs are carefully under-fitted. Our approach begins
  with a novel observation called the inlier-memorization (IM) effect–when training
  a deep generative model with data including outliers, the model initially memorizes
  inliers before outliers. Based on this finding, we develop a new method called the
  outlier detection via the IM effect (ODIM). Remarkably, the ODIM requires only a
  few updates, making it computationally efficient–at least tens of times faster than
  other deep-learning-based algorithms. Also, the ODIM filters out outliers excellently,
  regardless of the data type, including tabular, image, and text data. To validate
  the superiority and efficiency of our method, we provide extensive empirical analyses
  on close to 60 datasets.
