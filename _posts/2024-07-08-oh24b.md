title: 'Sign Gradient Descent-based Neuronal Dynamics: ANN-to-SNN Conversion Beyond
  ReLU Network'
openreview: kfpe7Dg23G
abstract: Spiking neural network (SNN) is studied in multidisciplinary domains to
  (i) enable order-of-magnitudes energy-efficient AI inference, and (ii) computationally
  simulate neuroscientific mechanisms. The lack of discrete theory obstructs the practical
  application of SNN by limiting its performance and nonlinearity support. We present
  a new optimization-theoretic perspective of the discrete dynamics of spiking neuron.
  We prove that a discrete dynamical system of simple integrate-and-fire models approximates
  the subgradient method over unconstrained optimization problems. We practically
  extend our theory to introduce a novel sign gradient descent (signGD)-based neuronal
  dynamics that can (i) approximate diverse nonlinearities beyond ReLU, and (ii) advance
  ANN-to-SNN conversion performance in low time-steps. Experiments on large-scale
  datasets show that our technique achieve (i) state-of-the-art performance in ANN-to-SNN
  conversion, and (ii) is first to convert new DNN architectures, e.g., ConvNext,
  MLP-Mixer, and ResMLP. We publicly share our source code at www.github.com/snuhcs/snn_signgd
