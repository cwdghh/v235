title: 'NeuralIndicator: Implicit Surface Reconstruction from Neural Indicator Priors'
openreview: 7ckuC9C2FZ
abstract: The neural implicit surface reconstruction from unorganized points is still
  challenging, especially when the point clouds are incomplete and/or noisy with complex
  topology structure. Unlike previous approaches performing neural implicit surface
  learning relying on local shape priors, this paper proposes to utilize global shape
  priors to regularize the neural implicit function learning for more reliable surface
  reconstruction. To this end, we first introduce a differentiable module to generate
  a smooth indicator function, which globally encodes both the indicative prior and
  local SDFs of the entire input point cloud. Benefit from this, we propose a new
  framework, called NeuralIndicator, to jointly learn both the smooth indicator function
  and neural implicit function simultaneously, using the global shape prior encoded
  by smooth indicator function to effectively regularize the neural implicit function
  learning, towards reliable and high-fidelity surface reconstruction from unorganized
  points without any normal information. Extensive evaluations on synthetic and real-scan
  datasets show that our approach consistently outperforms previous approaches, especially
  when point clouds are incomplete and/or noisy with complex topology structure.
