title: 'Position: Cracking the Code of Cascading Disparity Towards Marginalized Communities'
openreview: XDz9leJ9iK
abstract: The rise of foundation models holds immense promise for advancing AI, but
  this progress may amplify existing risks and inequalities, leaving marginalized
  communities behind. In this position paper, we discuss that disparities towards
  marginalized communities – performance, representation, privacy, robustness, interpretability
  and safety – are not isolated concerns but rather interconnected elements of a cascading
  disparity phenomenon. We contrast foundation models with traditional models and
  highlight the potential for exacerbated disparity against marginalized communities.
  Moreover, we emphasize the unique threat of cascading impacts in foundation models,
  where interconnected disparities can trigger long-lasting negative consequences,
  specifically to the people on the margin. We define marginalized communities within
  the machine learning context and explore the multifaceted nature of disparities.
  We analyze the sources of these disparities, tracing them from data creation, training
  and deployment procedures to highlight the complex technical and socio-technical
  landscape. To mitigate the pressing crisis, we conclude with a set of calls to action
  to mitigate disparity at its source.
