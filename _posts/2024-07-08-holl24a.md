title: "$\\bfΦ_\\textrmFlow$: Differentiable Simulations for PyTorch, TensorFlow and
  Jax"
openreview: 4oD0tRrUOX
abstract: Differentiable processes have proven an invaluable tool for machine learning
  (ML) in scientific and engineering settings, but most ML libraries are not primarily
  designed for such applications. We present $\Phi_\textrm{Flow}$, a Python toolkit
  that seamlessly integrates with PyTorch, TensorFlow, Jax and NumPy, simplifying
  the process of writing differentiable simulation code at every step. $\Phi_\textrm{Flow}$
  provides many essential features that go beyond the capabilities of the base libraries,
  such as differential operators, boundary conditions, the ability to write dimensionality-agnostic
  code, floating-point precision management, fully differentiable preconditioned (sparse)
  linear solves, automatic matrix generation via function tracing, integration of
  SciPy optimizers, simulation vectorization, and visualization tools. At the same
  time, $\Phi_\textrm{Flow}$ inherits all important traits of the base ML libraries,
  such as GPU / TPU support, just-in-time compilation, and automatic differentiation.
  Put together, these features drastically simplify scientific code like PDE or ODE
  solvers on grids or unstructured meshes, and $\Phi_\textrm{Flow}$ even includes
  out-of-the-box support for fluid simulations. $\Phi_\textrm{Flow}$ has been used
  in various publications and as a ground-truth solver in multiple scientific data
  sets.
