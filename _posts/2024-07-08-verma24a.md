title: Topological Neural Networks go Persistent, Equivariant, and Continuous
openreview: ELFZWG9C7l
abstract: Topological Neural Networks (TNNs) incorporate higher-order relational information
  beyond pairwise interactions, enabling richer representations than Graph Neural
  Networks (GNNs). Concurrently, topological descriptors based on persistent homology
  (PH) are being increasingly employed to augment the GNNs. We investigate the benefits
  of integrating these two paradigms. Specifically, we introduce <em>TopNets</em>
  as a broad framework that subsumes and unifies various methods in the intersection
  of GNNs/TNNs and PH such as (generalizations of) RePHINE and TOGL. TopNets can also
  be readily adapted to handle (symmetries in) geometric complexes, extending the
  scope of TNNs and PH to spatial settings. Theoretically, we show that PH descriptors
  can provably enhance the expressivity of simplicial message-passing networks. Empirically,
  (continuous and $E(n)$-equivariant extensions of) TopNets achieve strong performance
  across diverse tasks, including antibody design, molecular dynamics simulation,
  and drug property prediction.
