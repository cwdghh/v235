title: Asymptotically Optimal and Computationally Efficient Average Treatment Effect
  Estimation in A/B testing
openreview: eqIGoEoI10
abstract: Motivated by practical applications in clinical trials and online platforms,
  we study A/B testing with the aim of estimating a confidence interval (CI) for the
  average treatment effect (ATE) using the minimum expected sample size. This CI should
  have a width at most $\epsilon$ while ensuring that the probability of the CI not
  containing the true ATE is at most $\delta$. To answer this, we first establish
  a lower bound on the expected sample size needed for any adaptive policy which constructs
  a CI of ATE with desired properties. Specifically, we prove that the lower bound
  is based on the solution to a max-min non-convex optimization problem for small
  $\delta$. Tailoring the “plug-in” approach for the ATE problem, we construct an
  adaptive policy that is asymptotically optimal, i.e., matches the lower bound on
  the expected sample size for small $\delta$. Interestingly, we find that, for small
  $\epsilon$ and $\delta$, the asymptotically optimal fraction of treatment assignment
  for A and B is proportional to the standard deviation of the outcome distributions
  of treatments A and B, respectively. However, as the proposed approach can be computationally
  intensive, we propose an alternative adaptive policy. This new policy, informed
  by insights from our lower bound analysis, is computationally efficient while remaining
  asymptotically optimal for small values of $\epsilon$ and $\delta$. Numerical comparisons
  demonstrate that both policies perform similarly across practical values of $\epsilon$
  and $\delta$, offering efficient solutions for A/B testing.
