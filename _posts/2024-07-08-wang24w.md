title: 'EvGGS: A Collaborative Learning Framework for Event-based Generalizable Gaussian
  Splatting'
openreview: isUSVgS7W1
abstract: Event cameras offer promising advantages such as high dynamic range and
  low latency, making them well-suited for challenging lighting conditions and fast-moving
  scenarios. However, reconstructing 3D scenes from raw event streams is difficult
  because event data is sparse and does not carry absolute color information. To release
  its potential in 3D reconstruction, we propose the first event-based generalizable
  3D reconstruction framework, which reconstructs scenes as 3D Gaussians from only
  event input in a feedforward manner and can generalize to unseen cases without any
  retraining. This framework includes a depth estimation module, an intensity reconstruction
  module, and a Gaussian regression module. These submodules connect in a cascading
  manner, and we collaboratively train them with a designed joint loss to make them
  mutually promote. To facilitate related studies, we build a novel event-based 3D
  dataset with various material objects and calibrated labels of greyscale images,
  depth maps, camera poses, and silhouettes. Experiments show models that have jointly
  trained significantly outperform those trained individually. Our approach performs
  better than all baselines in reconstruction quality, and depth/intensity predictions
  with satisfactory rendering speed.
