title: Training Greedy Policy for Proposal Batch Selection in Expensive Multi-Objective
  Combinatorial Optimization
openreview: jP8mf34iCW
abstract: Active learning is increasingly adopted for expensive multi-objective combinatorial
  optimization problems, but it involves a challenging subset selection problem, optimizing
  the batch acquisition score that quantifies the goodness of a batch for evaluation.
  Due to the excessively large search space of the subset selection problem, prior
  methods optimize the batch acquisition on the latent space, which has discrepancies
  with the actual space, or optimize individual acquisition scores without considering
  the dependencies among candidates in a batch instead of directly optimizing the
  batch acquisition. To manage the vast search space, a simple and effective approach
  is the greedy method, which decomposes the problem into smaller subproblems, yet
  it has difficulty in parallelization since each subproblem depends on the outcome
  from the previous ones. To this end, we introduce a novel greedy-style subset selection
  algorithm that optimizes batch acquisition directly on the combinatorial space by
  sequential greedy sampling from the greedy policy, specifically trained to address
  all greedy subproblems concurrently. Notably, our experiments on the red fluorescent
  proteins design task show that our proposed method achieves the baseline performance
  in 1.69x fewer queries, demonstrating its efficiency.
