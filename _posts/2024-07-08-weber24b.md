title: Learning to Compile Programs to Neural Networks
openreview: rJti61Uere
abstract: A <em>neural surrogate</em> is a neural network that mimics the behavior
  of a program. Neural surrogates of programs have been used to automatically tune
  program inputs, adapt programs to new settings, and accelerate computations. Neural
  surrogates have traditionally been developed by training on input-output examples
  for a single program. Language models present another approach wherein a model is
  trained on a single, large dataset then directly consumes program text, to act as
  a neural surrogate of the program. Having the language model as both the neural
  surrogate generator and the neural surrogate, however, poses a tradeoff of limited
  accuracy or excessive resource consumption. We present <em>neural surrogate compilation</em>,
  a technique for producing neural surrogates directly from program text without coupling
  neural surrogate generation and execution. We implement neural surrogate compilers
  using hypernetworks trained on a dataset of C programs and find they produce neural
  surrogates that are $1.91$-$9.50\times$ as data-efficient and train in $4.31$-$7.28\times$
  fewer epochs than neural surrogates trained from scratch.
