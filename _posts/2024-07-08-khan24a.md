title: Debating with More Persuasive LLMs Leads to More Truthful Answers
openreview: iLCZtl7FTa
abstract: 'Common methods for aligning large language models (LLMs) with desired behaviour
  heavily rely on human-labelled data. However, as models grow increasingly sophisticated,
  they will surpass human expertise, and the role of human evaluation will evolve
  into non-experts overseeing experts. In anticipation of this, we ask: can weaker
  models assess the correctness of stronger models? We investigate this question in
  an analogous setting, where stronger models (experts) possess the necessary information
  to answer questions and weaker models (non-experts) lack this information. The method
  we evaluate is <em>debate</em>, where two LLM experts each argue for a different
  answer, and a non-expert selects the answer. We find that debate consistently helps
  both non-expert models and humans answer questions, achieving 76% and 88% accuracy
  respectively (naive baselines obtain 48% and 60%). Furthermore, optimising expert
  debaters for persuasiveness in an unsupervised manner improves non-expert ability
  to identify the truth in debates. Our results provide encouraging empirical evidence
  for the viability of aligning models with debate in the absence of ground truth.'
