title: 'Causal-IQA: Towards the Generalization of Image Quality Assessment Based on
  Causal Inference'
openreview: gKPkipJ3gm
abstract: 'Due to the high cost of Image Quality Assessment (IQA) datasets, achieving
  robust generalization remains challenging for prevalent deep learning-based IQA
  methods. To address this, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end blind IQA method:
  Causal-IQA. Specifically, we first analyze the causal mechanisms in IQA tasks and
  construct a causal graph to understand the interplay and confounding effects between
  distortion types, image contents, and subjective human ratings. Then, through shifting
  the focus from correlations to causality, Causal-IQA aims to improve the estimation
  accuracy of image quality scores by mitigating the confounding effects using a causality-based
  optimization strategy. This optimization strategy is implemented on the sample subsets
  constructed by a Counterfactual Division process based on the Backdoor Criterion.
  Extensive experiments illustrate the superiority of Causal-IQA.'
