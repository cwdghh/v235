title: Simplicity Bias via Global Convergence of Sharpness Minimization
openreview: VUTyzH63Xa
abstract: The remarkable generalization ability of neural networks is usually attributed
  to the implicit bias of SGD, which often yields models with lower complexity using
  simpler (e.g. linear) and low-rank features. Recent works have provided empirical
  and theoretical evidence for the bias of particular variants of SGD (such as label
  noise SGD) toward flatter regions of the loss landscape. Despite the folklore intuition
  that flat solutions are ’simple’, the connection with the simplicity of the final
  trained model (e.g. low-rank) is not well understood. In this work, we take a step
  toward bridging this gap by studying the simplicity structure that arises from minimizers
  of the sharpness for a class of two-layer neural networks. We show that, for any
  high dimensional training data and certain activations, with small enough step size,
  label noise SGD always converges to a network that replicates a single linear feature
  across all neurons; thereby implying a simple rank one feature matrix. To obtain
  this result, our main technical contribution is to show that label noise SGD always
  minimizes the sharpness on the manifold of models with zero loss for two-layer networks.
  Along the way, we discover a novel property — a local geodesic convexity — of the
  trace of Hessian of the loss at approximate stationary points on the manifold of
  zero loss, which links sharpness to the geometry of the manifold. This tool may
  be of independent interest.
