title: Efficient Contrastive Learning for Fast and Accurate Inference on Graphs
openreview: vsy21Xodrt
abstract: Graph contrastive learning has made remarkable advances in settings where
  there is a scarcity of task-specific labels. Despite these advances, the significant
  computational overhead for representation inference incurred by existing methods
  that rely on intensive message passing makes them unsuitable for latency-constrained
  applications. In this paper, we present GraphECL, a simple and efficient contrastive
  learning method for fast inference on graphs. GraphECL does away with the need for
  expensive message passing during inference. Specifically, it introduces a novel
  coupling of the MLP and GNN models, where the former learns to computationally efficiently
  mimic the computations performed by the latter. We provide a theoretical analysis
  showing why MLP can capture essential structural information in neighbors well enough
  to match the performance of GNN in downstream tasks. The extensive experiments on
  widely used real-world benchmarks that show that GraphECL achieves superior performance
  and inference efficiency compared to state-of-the-art graph constrastive learning
  (GCL) methods on homophilous and heterophilous graphs.
