title: 'REST: Efficient and Accelerated EEG Seizure Analysis through Residual State
  Updates'
openreview: 9GbAea74O6
abstract: EEG-based seizure detection models face challenges in terms of inference
  speed and memory efficiency, limiting their real-time implementation in clinical
  devices. This paper introduces a novel graph-based residual state update mechanism
  (REST) for real-time EEG signal analysis in applications such as epileptic seizure
  detection. By leveraging a combination of graph neural networks and recurrent structures,
  REST efficiently captures both non-Euclidean geometry and temporal dependencies
  within EEG data. Our model demonstrates high accuracy in both seizure detection
  and classification tasks. Notably, REST achieves a remarkable 9-fold acceleration
  in inference speed compared to state-of-the-art models, while simultaneously demanding
  substantially less memory than the smallest model employed for this task. These
  attributes position REST as a promising candidate for real-time implementation in
  clinical devices, such as Responsive Neurostimulation or seizure alert systems.
