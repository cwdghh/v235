title: Potential Based Diffusion Motion Planning
openreview: Qb68Rs0p9f
abstract: Effective motion planning in high dimensional spaces is a long-standing
  open problem in robotics. One class of traditional motion planning algorithms corresponds
  to potential-based motion planning. An advantage of potential based motion planning
  is composability â€“ different motion constraints can easily combined by adding corresponding
  potentials. However, constructing motion paths from potentials requires solving
  a global optimization across configuration space potential landscape, which is often
  prone to local minima. We propose a new approach towards learning potential based
  motion planning, where we train a neural network to capture and learn an easily
  optimizable potentials over motion planning trajectories. We illustrate the effectiveness
  of such approach, significantly outperforming both classical and recent learned
  motion planning approaches and avoiding issues with local minima. We further illustrate
  its inherent composability, enabling us to generalize to a multitude of different
  motion constraints. Project website at https://energy-based-model.github.io/potential-motion-plan.
