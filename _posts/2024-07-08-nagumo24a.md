title: Density Ratio Estimation with Doubly Strong Robustness
openreview: PykISfqvet
abstract: We develop two density ratio estimation (DRE) methods with robustness to
  outliers. These are based on the divergence with a weight function to weaken the
  adverse effects of outliers. One is based on the Unnormalized Kullback-Leibler divergence,
  called Weighted DRE, and its optimization is a convex problem. The other is based
  on the γ-divergence, called γ-DRE, which improves a normalizing term problem of
  Weighted DRE. Its optimization is a DC (Difference of Convex functions) problem
  and needs more computation than a convex problem. These methods have doubly strong
  robustness, which means robustness to the heavy contamination of both the reference
  and target distributions. Numerical experiments show that our proposals are more
  robust than the previous methods.
