title: A Fixed-Point Approach for Causal Generative Modeling
openreview: JpzIGzru5F
abstract: We propose a novel formalism for describing Structural Causal Models (SCMs)
  as fixed-point problems on causally ordered variables, eliminating the need for
  Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and establish the weakest known conditions for their
  unique recovery given the topological ordering (TO). Based on this, we design a
  two-stage causal generative model that first infers in a zero-shot manner a valid
  TO from observations, and then learns the generative SCM on the ordered variables.
  To infer TOs, we propose to amortize the learning of TOs on synthetically generated
  datasets by sequentially predicting the leaves of graphs seen during training. To
  learn SCMs, we design a transformer-based architecture that exploits a new attention
  mechanism enabling the modeling of causal structures, and show that this parameterization
  is consistent with our formalism. Finally, we conduct an extensive evaluation of
  each method individually, and show that when combined, our model outperforms various
  baselines on generated out-of-distribution problems.
