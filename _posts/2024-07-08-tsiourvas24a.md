title: 'Overcoming the Optimizer’s Curse: Obtaining Realistic Prescriptions from Neural
  Networks'
openreview: zB6VQzDmK8
abstract: We study the problem of obtaining optimal and realistic prescriptions when
  using ReLU networks for data-driven decision-making. In this setting, the network
  is used to predict a quantity of interest and then is optimized to retrieve the
  decisions that maximize the quantity (e.g. find the best prices that maximize revenue).
  However, optimizing over-parameterized models often produces unrealistic prescriptions,
  far from the data manifold. This phenomenon is known as the Optimizer’s Curse. To
  tackle this problem, we model the requirement for the resulting decisions to align
  with the data manifold as a tractable optimization constraint. This is achieved
  by reformulating the highly nonlinear Local Outlier Factor (LOF) metric as a single
  linear or quadratic constraint. To solve the problem efficiently for large networks,
  we propose an adaptive sampling algorithm that reduces the initial hard-to-solve
  optimization problem into a small number of significantly easier-to-solve problems
  by restricting the decision space to realistic polytopes, i.e. polytopes of the
  decision space that contain at least one realistic data point. Experiments on publicly
  available networks demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of our approach.
