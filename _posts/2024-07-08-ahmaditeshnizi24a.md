title: 'OptiMUS: Scalable Optimization Modeling with (MI)LP Solvers and Large Language
  Models'
openreview: YT1dtdLvSN
abstract: Optimization problems are pervasive in sectors from manufacturing and distribution
  to healthcare. However, most such problems are still solved heuristically by hand
  rather than optimally by state-of-the-art solvers because the expertise required
  to formulate and solve these problems limits the widespread adoption of optimization
  tools and techniques. This paper introduces OptiMUS, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based
  agent designed to formulate and solve (mixed integer) linear programming problems
  from their natural language descriptions. OptiMUS can develop mathematical models,
  write and debug solver code, evaluate the generated solutions, and improve its model
  and code based on these evaluations. OptiMUS utilizes a modular structure to process
  problems, allowing it to handle problems with long descriptions and complex data
  without long prompts. Experiments demonstrate that OptiMUS outperforms existing
  state-of-the-art methods on easy datasets by more than $20$% and on hard datasets
  (including a new dataset, NLP4LP, released with this paper that features long and
  complex problems) by more than $30$%. The implementation and the datasets are available
  at https://github.com/teshnizi/OptiMUS.
