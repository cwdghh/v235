title: A Space Group Symmetry Informed Network for O(3) Equivariant Crystal Tensor
  Prediction
openreview: BOFjRnJ9mX
abstract: We consider the prediction of general tensor properties of crystalline materials,
  including dielectric, piezoelectric, and elastic tensors. A key challenge here is
  how to make the predictions satisfy the unique tensor equivariance to both O(3)
  and crystal space groups. To this end, we propose a General Materials Tensor Network
  (GMTNet), which is carefully designed to satisfy the required symmetries. To evaluate
  our method, we curate a dataset and establish evaluation metrics that are tailored
  to the intricacies of crystal tensor predictions. Experimental results show that
  our GMTNet not only achieves promising performance on crystal tensors of various
  orders but also generates predictions fully consistent with the intrinsic crystal
  symmetries. Our code is publicly available as part of the AIRS library (https://github.com/divelab/AIRS).
