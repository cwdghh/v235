title: Bridging Environments and Language with Rendering Functions and Vision-Language
  Models
openreview: ZrM67ZZ5vj
abstract: 'Vision-language models (VLMs) have tremendous potential for <em>grounding</em>
  language, and thus enabling <em>language-conditioned agents (LCAs)</em> to perform
  diverse tasks specified with text. This has motivated the study of LCAs based on
  reinforcement learning (RL) with rewards given by rendering images of an environment
  and evaluating those images with VLMs. If single-task RL is employed, such approaches
  are limited by the cost and time required to train a policy for each new task. Multi-task
  RL (MTRL) is a natural alternative, but requires a carefully designed corpus of
  training tasks and does not always generalize reliably to new tasks. Therefore,
  this paper introduces a novel decomposition of the problem of building an LCA: first
  find an <em>environment configuration</em> that has a high VLM score for text describing
  a task; then use a (pretrained) goal-conditioned policy to reach that configuration.
  We also explore several enhancements to the speed and quality of VLM-based LCAs,
  notably, the use of distilled models, and the evaluation of configurations from
  multiple viewpoints to resolve the ambiguities inherent in a single 2D view. We
  demonstrate our approach on the Humanoid environment, showing that it results in
  LCAs that outperform MTRL baselines in zero-shot generalization, without requiring
  any textual task descriptions or other forms of environment-specific annotation
  during training.'
