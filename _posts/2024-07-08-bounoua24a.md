title: 'S$Ω$I: Score-based O-INFORMATION Estimation'
openreview: LuhWZ2oJ5L
abstract: The analysis of scientific data and complex multivariate systems requires
  information quantities that capture relationships among multiple random variables.
  Recently, new information-theoretic measures have been developed to overcome the
  shortcomings of classical ones, such as mutual information, that are restricted
  to considering pairwise interactions. Among them, the concept of information synergy
  and redundancy is crucial for understanding the high-order dependencies between
  variables. One of the most prominent and versatile measures based on this concept
  is <em>O-information</em>, which provides a clear and scalable way to quantify the
  synergy-redundancy balance in multivariate systems. However, its practical application
  is limited to simplified cases. In this work, we introduce <b>S$\Omega$I</b>, which
  allows to compute <em>O-information</em> without restrictive assumptions about the
  system while leveraging a unique model. Our experiments validate our approach on
  synthetic data, and demonstrate the effectiveness of <b>S$\Omega$I</b> in the context
  of a real-world use case.
