title: Integrating Global Context Contrast and Local Sensitivity for Blind Image Quality
  Assessment
openreview: MRYS3Zb4iV
abstract: 'Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA) mirrors subjective made by human
  observers. Generally, humans favor comparing relative qualities over predicting
  absolute qualities directly. However, current BIQA models focus on mining the "local"
  context, i.e., the relationship between information among individual images and
  the absolute quality of the image, ignoring the "global" context of the relative
  quality contrast among different images in the training data. In this paper, we
  present the Perceptual Context and Sensitivity BIQA (CSIQA), a novel contrastive
  learning paradigm that seamlessly integrates "global” and "local” perspectives into
  the BIQA. Specifically, the CSIQA comprises two primary components: 1) A Quality
  Context Contrastive Learning module, which is equipped with different contrastive
  learning strategies to effectively capture potential quality correlations in the
  global context of the dataset. 2) A Quality-aware Mask Attention Module, which employs
  the random mask to ensure the consistency with visual local sensitivity, thereby
  improving the model’s perception of local distortions. Extensive experiments on
  eight standard BIQA datasets demonstrate the superior performance to the state-of-the-art
  BIQA methods.'
