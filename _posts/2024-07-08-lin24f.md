title: 'Structured Inverse-Free Natural Gradient Descent: Memory-Efficient & Numerically-Stable
  KFAC'
openreview: Y2wRKE0Qor
abstract: Second-order methods such as KFAC can be useful for neural net training.
  However, they are often memory-inefficient since their preconditioning Kronecker
  factors are dense, and numerically unstable in low precision as they require matrix
  inversion or decomposition. These limitations render such methods unpopular for
  modern mixed-precision training. We address them by (i) formulating an inverse-free
  KFAC update and (ii) imposing structures in the Kronecker factors, resulting in
  structured inverse-free natural gradient descent (SINGD). On modern neural networks,
  we show that SINGD is memory-efficient and numerically robust, in contrast to KFAC,
  and often outperforms AdamW even in half precision. Our work closes a gap between
  first- and second-order methods in modern low-precision training.
