title: 'Theoretical insights for diffusion guidance: A case study for Gaussian mixture
  models'
openreview: M1ADedSnlJ
abstract: Diffusion models benefit from instillation of task-specific information
  into the score function to steer the sample generation towards desired properties.
  Such information is coined as guidance. For example, in text-to-image synthesis,
  text input is encoded as guidance to generate semantically aligned images. Proper
  guidance inputs are closely tied with the performance of diffusion models. A common
  observation is that strong guidance promotes a tight alignment to the task-specific
  information, while reduces the diversity of the generated samples. In this paper,
  we provide the first theoretical study towards the influence of guidance on diffusion
  models in the context of Gaussian mixture models. Under mild conditions, we prove
  that incorporating diffusion guidance not only boosts prediction confidence but
  also diminishes distribution diversity, leading to a reduction in the differential
  entropy of the output distribution. Our analysis covers the widely used DDPM and
  DDIM sampling schemes, and leverages comparison inequalities in differential equations
  as well as the Fokker-Planck equation that characterizes the evolution of probability
  density function, which may be of independent theoretical interest.
