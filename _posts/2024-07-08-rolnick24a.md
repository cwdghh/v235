title: 'Position: Application-Driven Innovation in Machine Learning'
openreview: xEB2oF3vvb
abstract: In this position paper, we argue that application-driven research has been
  systemically under-valued in the machine learning community. As applications of
  machine learning proliferate, innovative algorithms inspired by specific real-world
  challenges have become increasingly important. Such work offers the potential for
  significant impact not merely in domains of application but also in machine learning
  itself. In this paper, we describe the paradigm of application-driven research in
  machine learning, contrasting it with the more standard paradigm of methods-driven
  research. We illustrate the benefits of application-driven machine learning and
  how this approach can productively synergize with methods-driven work. Despite these
  benefits, we find that reviewing, hiring, and teaching practices in machine learning
  often hold back application-driven innovation. We outline how these processes may
  be improved.
