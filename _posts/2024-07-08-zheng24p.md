title: Multi-layer Rehearsal Feature Augmentation for Class-Incremental Learning
openreview: aksdU1KOpT
abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) seeks to learn new concepts without forgetting
  previously learned knowledge. To achieve this, rehearsal-based methods keep a replay
  memory consisting of a small number of trained samples from previous tasks. However,
  recent studies show that rehearsal-based methods are prone to overfitting on rehearsal
  samples, resulting in poor generalization on previous tasks. Since the generalization
  error is bounded by the margin on the training dataset, in this paper, we study
  the generalization by all-layer margin on deep neural networks to alleviate catastrophic
  forgetting. Specifically, we show that the average margin of the rehearsal samples
  are smaller during incremental learning. To acquire larger margin thus better generalization
  on rehearsal samples, we propose Multi-layer Rehearsal Feature Augmentation (MRFA)
  in rehearsal training to optimize the all-layer margin on rehearsal samples. The
  proposed method augments the features of rehearsal samples at each layer by gradient
  ascent step of the current model with respect to the feature. With such augmentations
  on layer features, the margin on rehearsal samples are larger, rehearsal samples
  are able to provide more information for refining the decision boundary during incremental
  learning, thus alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show the
  effectiveness of MRFA on various CIL scenarios.
