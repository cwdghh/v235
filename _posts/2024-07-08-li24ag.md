title: 'Visual-Text Cross Alignment: Refining the Similarity Score in Vision-Language
  Models'
openreview: JymXv7mkrQ
abstract: It has recently been discovered that using a pre-trained <em>vision-language
  model</em> (VLM), e.g., CLIP, to align a whole query image with several finer text
  descriptions generated by a large language model can significantly enhance zero-shot
  performance. However, in this paper, we empirically find that the finer descriptions
  tend to align more effectively with <em>local areas of the query image</em> rather
  than the whole image, and then we theoretically validate this finding. Thus, we
  present a method called <em>weighted visual-text cross alignment</em> (WCA). This
  method begins with a <em>localized visual prompting</em> technique, designed to
  identify local visual areas within the query image. The local visual areas are then
  <em>cross-aligned</em> with the finer descriptions by creating a similarity matrix
  using the pre-trained VLM. To determine how well a query image aligns with each
  category, we develop a score function based on the weighted similarities in this
  matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves
  zero-shot performance across various datasets, achieving results that are even comparable
  to few-shot learning methods.
