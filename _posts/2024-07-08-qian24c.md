title: Efficient Non-stationary Online Learning by Wavelets with Applications to Online
  Distribution Shift Adaptation
openreview: KNedb3bQ4h
abstract: Dynamic regret minimization offers a principled way for non-stationary online
  learning, where the algorithmâ€™s performance is evaluated against changing comparators.
  Prevailing methods often employ a two-layer online ensemble, consisting of a group
  of base learners with different configurations and a meta learner that combines
  their outputs. Given the evident computational overhead associated with two-layer
  algorithms, this paper investigates how to attain optimal dynamic regret <em>without</em>
  deploying a model ensemble. To this end, we introduce the notion of <em>underlying
  dynamic regret</em>, a specific form of the general dynamic regret that can encompass
  many applications of interest. We show that almost optimal dynamic regret can be
  obtained using a single-layer model alone. This is achieved by an adaptive restart
  equipped with wavelet detection, wherein a novel streaming wavelet operator is introduced
  to online update the wavelet coefficients via a carefully designed binary indexed
  tree. We apply our method to the <em>online label shift</em> adaptation problem,
  leading to new algorithms with optimal dynamic regret and significantly improved
  computation/storage efficiency compared to prior arts. Extensive experiments validate
  our proposal.
