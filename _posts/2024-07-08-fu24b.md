title: A Touch, Vision, and Language Dataset for Multimodal Alignment
openreview: tFEOOH9eH0
abstract: 'Touch is an important sensing modality for humans, but it has not yet been
  incorporated into a multimodal generative language model. This is partially due
  to the difficulty of obtaining natural language labels for tactile data and the
  complexity of aligning tactile readings with both visual observations and language
  descriptions. As a step towards bridging that gap, this work introduces a new dataset
  of 44K in-the-wild visiontouch pairs, with English language labels annotated by
  humans (10%) and textual pseudo-labels from GPT-4V (90%). We use this dataset to
  train a vision-language-aligned tactile encoder for open-vocabulary classification
  and a touch-visionlanguage (TVL) model for text generation using the trained encoder.
  Results suggest that by incorporating touch, the TVL model improves (+29% classification
  accuracy) tactile-vision-language alignment over existing models trained on any
  pair of those modalities. Although only a small fraction of the dataset is human
  labeled, the TVL model demonstrates improved visual-tactile understanding over GPT-4V
  (+12%) and open-source vision-language models (+32%) on a new touch-vision understanding
  benchmark. Code, checkpoints and data are available on https: //tactile-vlm.github.io.'
