title: 'From Self-Attention to Markov Models: Unveiling the Dynamics of Generative
  Transformers'
openreview: 72oT4mPLUb
abstract: 'Modern language models rely on the transformer architecture and attention
  mechanism to perform language understanding and text generation. In this work, we
  study learning a 1-layer self-attention model from a set of prompts and the associated
  outputs sampled from the model. We first establish a formal link between the self-attention
  mechanism and Markov models under suitable conditions: Inputting a prompt to the
  self-attention model samples the output token according to a <em>context-conditioned
  Markov chain</em> (CCMC). <em>CCMC</em> is obtained by weighing the transition matrix
  of a standard Markov chain according to the sufficient statistics of the prompt/context.
  Building on this formalism, we develop identifiability/coverage conditions for the
  data distribution that guarantee consistent estimation of the latent model under
  a teacher-student setting and establish sample complexity guarantees under IID data.
  Finally, we study the problem of learning from a single output trajectory generated
  in response to an initial prompt. We characterize a <em>winner-takes-all</em> phenomenon
  where the generative process of self-attention evolves to sampling from a small
  set of <em>winner tokens</em> that dominate the context window. This provides a
  mathematical explanation to the tendency of modern LLMs to generate repetitive text.'
