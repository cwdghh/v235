title: Nonlinear Filtering with Brenier Optimal Transport Maps
openreview: blzDxD6bKt
abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of nonlinear filtering, i.e., computing
  the conditional distribution of the state of a stochastic dynamical system given
  a history of noisy partial observations. Conventional sequential importance resampling
  (SIR) particle filters suffer from fundamental limitations, in scenarios involving
  degenerate likelihoods or high-dimensional states, due to the weight degeneracy
  issue. In this paper, we explore an alternative method, which is based on estimating
  the Brenier optimal transport (OT) map from the current prior distribution of the
  state to the posterior distribution at the next time step. Unlike SIR particle filters,
  the OT formulation does not require the analytical form of the likelihood. Moreover,
  it allows us to harness the approximation power of neural networks to model complex
  and multi-modal distributions and employ stochastic optimization algorithms to enhance
  scalability. Extensive numerical experiments are presented that compare the OT method
  to the SIR particle filter and the ensemble Kalman filter, evaluating the performance
  in terms of sample efficiency, high-dimensional scalability, and the ability to
  capture complex and multi-modal distributions.
