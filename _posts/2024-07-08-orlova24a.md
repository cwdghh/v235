title: Deep Stochastic Mechanics
openreview: 64MQCia06B
abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep-learning-based approach for numerical
  simulation of a time-evolving Schr√∂dinger equation inspired by stochastic mechanics
  and generative diffusion models. Unlike existing approaches, which exhibit computational
  complexity that scales exponentially in the problem dimension, our method allows
  us to adapt to the latent low-dimensional structure of the wave function by sampling
  from the Markovian diffusion. Depending on the latent dimension, our method may
  have far lower computational complexity in higher dimensions. Moreover, we propose
  novel equations for stochastic quantum mechanics, resulting in quadratic computational
  complexity with respect to the number of dimensions. Numerical simulations verify
  our theoretical findings and show a significant advantage of our method compared
  to other deep-learning-based approaches used for quantum mechanics.
