title: 'Beyond the Calibration Point: Mechanism Comparison in Differential Privacy'
openreview: iQTElQbAqo
abstract: In differentially private (DP) machine learning, the privacy guarantees
  of DP mechanisms are often reported and compared on the basis of a single $(\varepsilon,
  \delta)$-pair. This practice overlooks that DP guarantees can vary substantially
  even between mechanisms sharing a given $(\varepsilon, \delta)$, and potentially
  introduces privacy vulnerabilities which can remain undetected. This motivates the
  need for robust, rigorous methods for comparing DP guarantees in such cases. Here,
  we introduce the $\Delta$-divergence between mechanisms which quantifies the worst-case
  excess privacy vulnerability of choosing one mechanism over another in terms of
  $(\varepsilon, \delta)$, $f$-DP and in terms of a newly presented Bayesian interpretation.
  Moreover, as a generalisation of the Blackwell theorem, it is endowed with strong
  decision-theoretic foundations. Through application examples, we show that our techniques
  can facilitate informed decision-making and reveal gaps in the current understanding
  of privacy risks, as current practices in DP-SGD often result in choosing mechanisms
  with high excess privacy vulnerabilities.
