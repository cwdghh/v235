title: Improving Group Robustness on Spurious Correlation Requires Preciser Group
  Inference
openreview: KycvgOCBBR
abstract: 'Standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) models may prioritize learning
  spurious correlations between spurious features and true labels, leading to poor
  accuracy on groups where these correlations do not hold. Mitigating this issue often
  requires expensive spurious attribute (group) labels or relies on trained ERM models
  to infer group labels when group information is unavailable. However, the significant
  performance gap in worst-group accuracy between using pseudo group labels and using
  oracle group labels inspires us to consider further improving group robustness through
  preciser group inference. Therefore, we propose GIC, a novel method that accurately
  infers group labels, resulting in improved worst-group performance. GIC trains a
  spurious attribute classifier based on two key properties of spurious correlations:
  (1) high correlation between spurious attributes and true labels, and (2) variability
  in this correlation between datasets with different group distributions. Empirical
  studies on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GIC in inferring group
  labels, and combining GIC with various downstream invariant learning methods improves
  worst-group accuracy, showcasing its powerful flexibility. Additionally, through
  analyzing the misclassifications in GIC, we identify an interesting phenomenon called
  semantic consistency, which may contribute to better decoupling the association
  between spurious attributes and labels, thereby mitigating spurious correlation.
  The code for GIC is available at https://github.com/yujinhanml/GIC9.'
