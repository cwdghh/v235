title: 'Deep Demonstration Tracing: Learning Generalizable Imitator Policy for Runtime
  Imitation from a Single Demonstration'
openreview: DJdVzxemdA
abstract: One-shot imitation learning (OSIL) is to learn an imitator agent that can
  execute multiple tasks with only a single demonstration. In real-world scenario,
  the environment is dynamic, e.g., unexpected changes can occur after demonstration.
  Thus, achieving generalization of the imitator agent is crucial as agents would
  inevitably face situations unseen in the provided demonstrations. While traditional
  OSIL methods excel in relatively stationary settings, their adaptability to such
  unforeseen changes, which asking for a higher level of generalization ability for
  the imitator agents, is limited and rarely discussed. In this work, we present a
  new algorithm called Deep Demonstration Tracing (DDT). In DDT, we propose a demonstration
  transformer architecture to encourage agents to adaptively trace suitable states
  in demonstrations. Besides, it integrates OSIL into a meta-reinforcement-learning
  training paradigm, providing regularization for policies in unexpected situations.
  We evaluate DDT on a new navigation task suite and robotics tasks, demonstrating
  its superior performance over existing OSIL methods across all evaluated tasks in
  dynamic environments with unforeseen changes. The project page is in https://osil-ddt.github.io.
