title: An Explicit Frame Construction for Normalizing 3D Point Clouds
openreview: SZ0JnRxi0x
abstract: Many real-world datasets are represented as 3D point clouds â€“ yet they often
  lack a predefined reference frame, posing a challenge for machine learning or general
  data analysis. Traditional methods for determining reference frames and normalizing
  3D point clouds often struggle with specific inputs, lack theoretical guarantees,
  or require massive data. We introduce a new algorithm that overcomes these limitations
  and guarantees both universality and compatibility with any learnable framework
  for 3D point cloud analysis. Our algorithm works with any input point cloud and
  performs consistently regardless of input complexities, unlike data-driven methods
  that are susceptible to biases or limited training data. Empirically, our algorithm
  outperforms existing methods in effectiveness and generalizability across diverse
  benchmark datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/Utah-Math-Data-Science/alignment.
