title: 'CCM: Real-Time Controllable Visual Content Creation Using Text-to-Image Consistency
  Models'
openreview: B4rViOCoNf
abstract: Consistency Models (CMs) have showed a promise in creating high-quality
  images with few steps. However, the way to add new conditional controls to the pre-trained
  CMs has not been explored. In this paper, we explore the pivotal subject of leveraging
  the generative capacity and efficiency of consistency models to facilitate controllable
  visual content creation via ControlNet. First, it is observed that ControlNet trained
  for diffusion models (DMs) can be directly applied to CMs for high-level semantic
  controls but sacrifice image low-level details and realism. To tackle with this
  issue, we develop a CMs-tailored training strategy for ControlNet using the consistency
  training. It is substantiated that ControlNet can be successfully established through
  the consistency training technique. Besides, a unified adapter can be trained utilizing
  the consistency training, which enhances the adaptation of DMâ€™s ControlNet. We quantitatively
  and qualitatively evaluate all strategies across various conditional controls, including
  sketch, hed, canny, depth, human pose, low-resolution image and masked image, with
  the pre-trained text-to-image latent consistency models.
