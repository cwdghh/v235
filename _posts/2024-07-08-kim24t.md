title: Attribute Based Interpretable Evaluation Metrics for Generative Models
openreview: Mw8kNVfdMs
abstract: When the training dataset comprises a 1:1 proportion of dogs to cats, a
  generative model that produces 1:1 dogs and cats better resembles the training species
  distribution than another model with 3:1 dogs and cats. Can we capture this phenomenon
  using existing metrics? Unfortunately, we cannot, because these metrics do not provide
  any interpretability beyond â€œdiversity". In this context, we propose a new evaluation
  protocol that measures the divergence of a set of generated images from the training
  set regarding the distribution of attribute strengths as follows. Singleattribute
  Divergence (SaD) reveals the attributes that are generated excessively or insufficiently
  by measuring the divergence of PDFs of individual attributes. Paired-attribute Divergence
  (PaD) reveals such pairs of attributes by measuring the divergence of joint PDFs
  of pairs of attributes. For measuring the attribute strengths of an image, we propose
  Heterogeneous CLIPScore (HCS) which measures the cosine similarity between image
  and text vectors with heterogeneous initial points. With SaD and PaD, we reveal
  the following about existing generative models. ProjectedGAN generates implausible
  attribute relationships such as baby with beard even though it has competitive scores
  of existing metrics. Diffusion models struggle to capture diverse colors in the
  datasets. The larger sampling timesteps of the latent diffusion model generate the
  more minor objects including earrings and necklace. Stable Diffusion v1.5 better
  captures the attributes than v2.1. Our metrics lay a foundation for explainable
  evaluations of generative models.
