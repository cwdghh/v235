title: 'TimeSiam: A Pre-Training Framework for Siamese Time-Series Modeling'
openreview: wrTzLoqbCg
abstract: Time series pre-training has recently garnered wide attention for its potential
  to reduce labeling expenses and benefit various downstream tasks. Prior methods
  are mainly based on pre-training techniques well-acknowledged in vision or language,
  such as masked modeling and contrastive learning. However, randomly masking time
  series or calculating series-wise similarity will distort or neglect inherent temporal
  correlations crucial in time series data. To emphasize temporal correlation modeling,
  this paper proposes TimeSiam as a simple but effective self-supervised pre-training
  framework for Time series based on Siamese networks. Concretely, TimeSiam pre-trains
  Siamese encoders to capture intrinsic temporal correlations between randomly sampled
  past and current subseries. With a simple data augmentation method (e.g. masking),
  TimeSiam can benefit from diverse augmented subseries and learn internal time-dependent
  representations through a past-to-current reconstruction. Moreover, learnable lineage
  embeddings are also introduced to distinguish temporal distance between sampled
  series and further foster the learning of diverse temporal correlations. TimeSiam
  consistently outperforms extensive advanced pre-training baselines, demonstrating
  superior forecasting and classification capabilities across 13 standard benchmarks
  in both intra- and cross-domain scenarios.
