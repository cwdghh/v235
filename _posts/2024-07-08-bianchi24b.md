title: Scalable Safe Policy Improvement for Factored Multi-Agent MDPs
openreview: Qc5umSsUi8
abstract: In this work, we focus on safe policy improvement in multi-agent domains
  where current state-of-the-art methods cannot be effectively applied because of
  large state and action spaces. We consider recent results using Monte Carlo Tree
  Search for Safe Policy Improvement with Baseline Bootstrapping and propose a novel
  algorithm that scales this approach to multi-agent domains, exploiting the factorization
  of the transition model and value function. Given a centralized behavior policy
  and a dataset of trajectories, our algorithm generates an improved policy by selecting
  joint actions using a novel extension of Max-Plus (or Variable Elimination) that
  constrains local actions to guarantee safety criteria. An empirical evaluation on
  multi-agent SysAdmin and multi-UAV Delivery shows that the approach scales to very
  large domains where state-of-the-art methods cannot work.
