title: The Perception-Robustness Tradeoff in Deterministic Image Restoration
openreview: jQA5iutPzd
abstract: 'We study the behavior of deterministic methods for solving inverse problems
  in imaging. These methods are commonly designed to achieve two goals: (1) attaining
  high perceptual quality, and (2) generating reconstructions that are consistent
  with the measurements. We provide a rigorous proof that the better a predictor satisfies
  these two requirements, the larger its Lipschitz constant must be, regardless of
  the nature of the degradation involved. In particular, to approach perfect perceptual
  quality and perfect consistency, the Lipschitz constant of the model must grow to
  infinity. This implies that such methods are necessarily more susceptible to adversarial
  attacks. We demonstrate our theory on single image super-resolution algorithms,
  addressing both noisy and noiseless settings. We also show how this undesired behavior
  can be leveraged to explore the posterior distribution, thereby allowing the deterministic
  model to imitate stochastic methods.'
