title: Averaging $n$-step Returns Reduces Variance in Reinforcement Learning
openreview: jM9A3Kz6Ki
abstract: Multistep returns, such as $n$-step returns and $\lambda$-returns, are commonly
  used to improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) methods. The
  variance of the multistep returns becomes the limiting factor in their length; looking
  too far into the future increases variance and reverses the benefits of multistep
  learning. In our work, we demonstrate the ability of compound returns—weighted averages
  of $n$-step returns—to reduce variance. We prove for the first time that any compound
  return with the same contraction modulus as a given $n$-step return has strictly
  lower variance. We additionally prove that this variance-reduction property improves
  the finite-sample complexity of temporal-difference learning under linear function
  approximation. Because general compound returns can be expensive to implement, we
  introduce two-bootstrap returns which reduce variance while remaining efficient,
  even when using minibatched experience replay. We conduct experiments showing that
  compound returns often increase the sample efficiency of $n$-step deep RL agents
  like DQN and PPO.
