title: Interpretability Illusions in the Generalization of Simplified Models
openreview: YJWlUMW6YP
abstract: 'A common method to study deep learning systems is to use simplified model
  representations—for example, using singular value decomposition to visualize the
  model’s hidden states in a lower dimensional space. This approach assumes that the
  results of these simplifications are faithful to the original model. Here, we illustrate
  an important caveat to this assumption: even if the simplified representations can
  accurately approximate the full model on the training set, they may fail to accurately
  capture the model’s behavior out of distribution. We illustrate this by training
  Transformer models on controlled datasets with systematic generalization splits,
  including the Dyck balanced-parenthesis languages and a code completion task. We
  simplify these models using tools like dimensionality reduction and clustering,
  and then explicitly test how these simplified proxies match the behavior of the
  original model. We find consistent generalization gaps: cases in which the simplified
  proxies are more faithful to the original model on the in-distribution evaluations
  and less faithful on various tests of systematic generalization. This includes cases
  where the original model generalizes systematically but the simplified proxies fail,
  and cases where the simplified proxies generalize better. Together, our results
  raise questions about the extent to which mechanistic interpretations derived using
  tools like SVD can reliably predict what a model will do in novel situations.'
