title: 'Leveraging (Biased) Information: Multi-armed Bandits with Offline Data'
openreview: WvIHbQhrTq
abstract: We leverage offline data to facilitate online learning in stochastic multi-armed
  bandits. The probability distributions that govern the offline data and the online
  rewards can be different. Without any non-trival upper bound on their difference,
  we show that no non-anticipatory policy can out-perform the UCB policy by (Auer
  et al. 2002), even in the presence of offline data. In complement, we propose an
  online policy MIN-UCB, which outperforms UCB when a non-trivial upper bound is given.
  MIN-UCB adaptively chooses to utilize the offline data when they are deemed informative,
  and to ignore them otherwise. MIN-UCB is shown to be tight in terms of both instance
  indepedent and dependent regret bounds. Finally, we corroborate the theoretical
  results with numerical experiments.
