title: 'BAT: Learning to Reason about Spatial Sounds with Large Language Models'
openreview: kao5hRX9YA
abstract: Spatial sound reasoning is a fundamental human skill, enabling us to navigate
  and interpret our surroundings based on sound. In this paper we present BAT, which
  combines the spatial sound perception ability of a binaural acoustic scene analysis
  model with the natural language reasoning capabilities of a large language model
  (LLM) to replicate this innate ability. To address the lack of existing datasets
  of in-the-wild spatial sounds, we synthesized a binaural audio dataset using AudioSet
  and SoundSpaces 2.0. Next, we developed SpatialSoundQA, a spatial sound-based question-answering
  dataset, offering a range of QA tasks that train BAT in various aspects of spatial
  sound perception and reasoning. The acoustic front end encoder of BAT is a novel
  spatial audio encoder named Spatial Audio Spectrogram Transformer, or Spatial-AST,
  which by itself achieves strong performance across sound event detection, spatial
  localization, and distance estimation. By integrating Spatial-AST with LLaMA-2 7B
  model, BAT transcends standard Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) tasks,
  enabling the model to reason about the relationships between the sounds in its environment.
  Our experiments demonstrate BATâ€™s superior performance on both spatial sound perception
  and reasoning, showcasing the immense potential of LLMs in navigating and interpreting
  complex spatial audio environments.
