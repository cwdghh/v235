title: Mean-field Underdamped Langevin Dynamics and its Spacetime Discretization
openreview: 4qsduFJDEB
abstract: We propose a new method called the N-particle underdamped Langevin algorithm
  for optimizing a special class of non-linear functionals defined over the space
  of probability measures. Examples of problems with this formulation include training
  mean-field neural networks, maximum mean discrepancy minimization and kernel Stein
  discrepancy minimization. Our algorithm is based on a novel spacetime discretization
  of the mean-field underdamped Langevin dynamics, for which we provide a new, fast
  mixing guarantee. In addition, we demonstrate that our algorithm converges globally
  in total variation distance, bridging the theoretical gap between the dynamics and
  its practical implementation.
