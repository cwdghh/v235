title: 'The Good, The Bad, and Why: Unveiling Emotions in Generative AI'
openreview: wlOaG9g0uq
abstract: 'Emotion significantly impacts our daily behaviors and interactions. While
  recent generative AI models, such as large language models, have shown impressive
  performance in various tasks, it remains unclear whether they truly comprehend emotions
  and why. This paper aims to address this gap by incorporating psychological theories
  to gain a holistic understanding of emotions in generative AI models. Specifically,
  we propose three approaches: 1) EmotionPrompt to enhance AI model performance, 2)
  EmotionAttack to impair AI model performance, and 3) EmotionDecode to explain the
  effects of emotional stimuli, both benign and malignant. Through extensive experiments
  involving language and multi-modal models on semantic understanding, logical reasoning,
  and generation tasks, we demonstrate that both textual and visual EmotionPrompt
  can boost the performance of AI models while EmotionAttack can hinder it. More importantly,
  EmotionDecode reveals that AI models can comprehend emotional stimuli akin to the
  mechanism of dopamine in the human brain. Our work heralds a novel avenue for exploring
  psychology to enhance our understanding of generative AI models, thus boosting the
  research and development of human-AI collaboration and mitigating potential risks.'
