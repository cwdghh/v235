title: Prompt-tuning Latent Diffusion Models for Inverse Problems
openreview: hrwIndai8e
abstract: We propose a new method for solving imaging inverse problems using text-to-image
  latent diffusion models as general priors. Existing methods using latent diffusion
  models for inverse problems typically rely on simple null text prompts, which can
  lead to suboptimal performance. To improve upon this, we introduce a method for
  prompt tuning, which jointly optimizes the text embedding on-the-fly while running
  the reverse diffusion. This allows us to generate images that are more faithful
  to the diffusion prior. Specifically, our approach involves a unified optimization
  framework that simultaneously considers the prompt, latent, and pixel values through
  alternating minimization. This significantly diminishes image artifacts - a major
  problem when using latent diffusion models instead of pixel-based diffusion ones.
  Our method, called P2L, outperforms both pixel- and latent-diffusion model-based
  inverse problem solvers on a variety of tasks, such as super-resolution, deblurring,
  and inpainting. Furthermore, P2L demonstrates remarkable scalability to higher resolutions
  without artifacts.
