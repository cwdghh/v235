title: Optimistic Multi-Agent Policy Gradient
openreview: MWTicAxmRP
abstract: "<em>Relative overgeneralization</em> (RO) occurs in cooperative multi-agent
  learning tasks when agents converge towards a suboptimal joint policy due to overfitting
  to suboptimal behaviors of other agents. No methods have been proposed for addressing
  RO in multi-agent policy gradient (MAPG) methods although these methods produce
  state-of-the-art results. To address this gap, we propose a general, yet simple,
  framework to enable optimistic updates in MAPG methods that alleviate the RO problem.
  Our approach involves clipping the advantage to eliminate negative values, thereby
  facilitating optimistic updates in MAPG. The optimism prevents individual agents
  from quickly converging to a local optimum. Additionally, we provide a formal analysis
  to show that the proposed method retains optimality at a fixed point. In extensive
  evaluations on a diverse set of tasks including the <em>Multi-agent MuJoCo</em>
  and <em>Overcooked</em> benchmarks, our method outperforms strong baselines on 13
  out of 19 tested tasks and matches the performance on the rest."
