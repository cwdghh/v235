title: Controlling Behavioral Diversity in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
openreview: qQjUgItPq4
abstract: 'The study of behavioral diversity in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
  (MARL) is a nascent yet promising field. In this context, the present work deals
  with the question of how to control the diversity of a multi-agent system. With
  no existing approaches to control diversity to a set value, current solutions focus
  on blindly promoting it via intrinsic rewards or additional loss functions, effectively
  changing the learning objective and lacking a principled measure for it. To address
  this, we introduce Diversity Control (DiCo), a method able to control diversity
  to an exact value of a given metric by representing policies as the sum of a parameter-shared
  component and dynamically scaled per-agent components. By applying constraints directly
  to the policy architecture, DiCo leaves the learning objective unchanged, enabling
  its applicability to any actor-critic MARL algorithm. We theoretically prove that
  DiCo achieves the desired diversity, and we provide several experiments, both in
  cooperative and competitive tasks, that show how DiCo can be employed as a novel
  paradigm to increase performance and sample efficiency in MARL. Multimedia results
