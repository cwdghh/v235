title: Reward-Free Kernel-Based Reinforcement Learning
openreview: QTt2xJI8vk
abstract: 'Achieving sample efficiency in Reinforcement Learning (RL) is primarily
  hinged on the efficient exploration of the underlying environment, but it is still
  unknown what are the best exploration strategies in different settings. We consider
  the <em>reward-free</em> RL problem, which operates in two phases: an exploration
  phase, where the agent gathers exploration trajectories over episodes irrespective
  of any predetermined reward function, and a subsequent planning phase, where a reward
  function is introduced. The agent then utilizes the episodes from the exploration
  phase to calculate a near-optimal policy. Existing algorithms and sample complexities
  for reward-free RL are limited to tabular, linear or very smooth function approximations,
  leaving the problem largely open for more general cases. We consider a broad range
  of kernel-based function approximations, including non-smooth kernels, and propose
  an algorithm based on adaptive domain partitioning. We show that our algorithm achieves
  order-optimal sample complexity for a large class of common kernels, which includes
  Mat√©rn and Neural Tangent kernels.'
