title: Positive and Unlabeled Learning with Controlled Probability Boundary Fence
openreview: xbQqhojHTg
abstract: Positive and Unlabeled (PU) learning refers to a special case of binary
  classification, and technically, it aims to induce a binary classifier from a few
  labeled positive training instances and loads of unlabeled instances. In this paper,
  we derive a theorem indicating that the probability boundary of the asymmetric disambiguation-free
  expected risk of PU learning is controlled by its asymmetric penalty, and we further
  empirically evaluated this theorem. Inspired by the theorem and its empirical evaluations,
  we propose an easy-to-implement two-stage PU learning method, namely <b>P</b>ositive
  and <b>U</b>nlabeled <b>L</b>earning with <b>C</b>ontrolled <b>P</b>robability <b>B</b>oundary
  <b>F</b>ence (<b>PULCPBF</b>). In the first stage, we train a set of weak binary
  classifiers concerning different probability boundaries by minimizing the asymmetric
  disambiguation-free empirical risks with specific asymmetric penalty values. We
  can interpret these induced weak binary classifiers as a probability boundary fence.
  For each unlabeled instance, we can use the predictions to locate its class posterior
  probability and generate a stochastic label. In the second stage, we train a strong
  binary classifier over labeled positive training instances and all unlabeled instances
  with stochastic labels in a self-training manner. Extensive empirical results demonstrate
  that PULCPBF can achieve competitive performance compared with the existing PU learning
  baselines.
