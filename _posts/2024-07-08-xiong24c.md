title: Distilling Morphology-Conditioned Hypernetworks for Efficient Universal Morphology
  Control
openreview: WjvEvYTy3w
abstract: 'Learning a universal policy across different robot morphologies can significantly
  improve learning efficiency and enable zero-shot generalization to unseen morphologies.
  However, learning a highly performant universal policy requires sophisticated architectures
  like transformers (TF) that have larger memory and computational cost than simpler
  multi-layer perceptrons (MLP). To achieve both good performance like TF and high
  efficiency like MLP at inference time, we propose HyperDistill, which consists of:
  (1) A morphology-conditioned hypernetwork (HN) that generates robot-wise MLP policies,
  and (2) A policy distillation approach that is essential for successful training.
  We show that on UNIMAL, a benchmark with hundreds of diverse morphologies, HyperDistill
  performs as well as a universal TF teacher policy on both training and unseen test
  robots, but reduces model size by 6-14 times, and computational cost by 67-160 times
  in different environments. Our analysis attributes the efficiency advantage of HyperDistill
  at inference time to knowledge decoupling, i.e., the ability to decouple inter-task
  and intra-task knowledge, a general principle that could also be applied to improve
  inference efficiency in other domains. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/MasterXiong/Universal-Morphology-Control.'
