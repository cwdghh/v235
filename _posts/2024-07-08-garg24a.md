title: Memorization Through the Lens of Curvature of Loss Function Around Samples
openreview: WQbDS9RydY
abstract: 'Deep neural networks are over-parameterized and easily overfit to and memorize
  the datasets that they train on. In the extreme case, it has been shown that networks
  can memorize a randomly labeled dataset. In this paper, we propose using the curvature
  of the loss function around each training sample, averaged over training epochs,
  as a measure of memorization of a sample. We show that this curvature metric effectively
  captures memorization statistics, both qualitatively and quantitatively in popular
  image datasets. We provide quantitative validation of the proposed metric against
  memorization scores released by Feldman & Zhang (2020). Further, experiments on
  mislabeled data detection show that corrupted samples are learned with high curvature
  and using curvature for identifying mislabelled examples outperforms existing approaches.
  Qualitatively, we find that high curvature samples correspond to long-tailed, mislabeled,
  or conflicting instances, indicating a likelihood of memorization. Notably, this
  analysis helps us find, to the best of our knowledge, a novel failure mode on the
  CIFAR100 and ImageNet datasets: that of duplicated images with differing labels.'
