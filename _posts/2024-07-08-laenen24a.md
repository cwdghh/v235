title: Dynamic Spectral Clustering with Provable Approximation Guarantee
openreview: coP4kPdhKr
abstract: This paper studies clustering algorithms for dynamically evolving graphs
  $\{G_t\}$, in which new edges (and potential new vertices) are added into a graph,
  and the underlying cluster structure of the graph can gradually change. The paper
  proves that, under some mild condition on the cluster-structure, the clusters of
  the final graph $G_T$ of $n_T$ vertices at time $T$ can be well approximated by
  a dynamic variant of the spectral clustering algorithm. The algorithm runs in amortised
  update time $O(1)$ and query time $o(n_T)$. Experimental studies on both synthetic
  and real-world datasets further confirm the practicality of our designed algorithm.
