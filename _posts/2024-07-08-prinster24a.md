title: Conformal Validity Guarantees Exist for Any Data Distribution (and How to Find
  Them)
openreview: F3936hVwQa
abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML) gain widespread
  adoption, practitioners are increasingly seeking means to quantify and control the
  risk these systems incur. This challenge is especially salient when such systems
  have autonomy to collect their own data, such as in black-box optimization and active
  learning, where their actions induce sequential feedback-loop shifts in the data
  distribution. Conformal prediction is a promising approach to uncertainty and risk
  quantification, but prior variants’ validity guarantees have assumed some form of
  “quasi-exchangeability” on the data distribution, thereby excluding many types of
  sequential shifts. In this paper we prove that conformal prediction can theoretically
  be extended to <em>any</em> joint data distribution, not just exchangeable or quasi-exchangeable
  ones. Although the most general case is exceedingly impractical to compute, for
  concrete practical applications we outline a procedure for deriving specific conformal
  algorithms for any data distribution, and we use this procedure to derive tractable
  algorithms for a series of AI/ML-agent-induced covariate shifts. We evaluate the
  proposed algorithms empirically on synthetic black-box optimization and active learning
  tasks.
