title: 'CRoFT: Robust Fine-Tuning with Concurrent Optimization for OOD Generalization
  and Open-Set OOD Detection'
openreview: xFDJBzPhci
abstract: 'Recent vision-language pre-trained models (VL-PTMs) have shown remarkable
  success in open-vocabulary tasks. However, downstream use cases often involve further
  fine-tuning of VL-PTMs, which may distort their general knowledge and impair their
  ability to handle distribution shifts. In real-world scenarios, machine learning
  systems inevitably encounter both covariate shifts (e.g., changes in image styles)
  and semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the importance
  of enhancing out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization on covariate shifts and simultaneously
  detecting semantic-shifted unseen classes. Thus a critical but underexplored question
  arises: How to improve VL-PTMsâ€™ generalization ability to closed-set OOD data, while
  effectively detecting open-set unseen classes during fine-tuning? In this paper,
  we propose a novel objective function of OOD detection that also serves to improve
  OOD generalization. We show that minimizing the gradient magnitude of energy scores
  on training data leads to domain-consistent Hessians of classification loss, a strong
  indicator for OOD generalization revealed by theoretical analysis. Based on this
  finding, we have developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for concurrent
  optimization of both tasks. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority
  of our method. The code is available at https://github.com/LinLLLL/CRoFT.'
