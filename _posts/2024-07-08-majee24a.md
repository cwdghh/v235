title: 'SCoRe: Submodular Combinatorial Representation Learning'
openreview: G8zDeKOp0R
abstract: In this paper we introduce the <b>SCoRe</b> (<b>S</b>ubmodular <b>Co</b>mbinatorial
  <b>Re</b>presentation Learning) framework, a novel approach in representation learning
  that addresses inter-class bias and intra-class variance. SCoRe provides a new combinatorial
  viewpoint to representation learning, by introducing a family of loss functions
  based on set-based submodular information measures. We develop two novel combinatorial
  formulations for loss functions, using the <em>Total Information</em> and <em>Total
  Correlation</em>, that naturally minimize intra-class variance and inter-class bias.
  Several commonly used metric/contrastive learning loss functions like supervised
  contrastive loss, orthogonal projection loss, and N-pairs loss, are all instances
  of SCoRe, thereby underlining the versatility and applicability of SCoRe in a broad
  spectrum of learning scenarios. Novel objectives in SCoRe naturally model class-imbalance
  with up to 7.6% improvement in classification on CIFAR-10-LT, CIFAR-100-LT, MedMNIST,
  2.1% on ImageNet-LT, and 19.4% in object detection on IDD and LVIS (v1.0), demonstrating
  its effectiveness over existing approaches.
