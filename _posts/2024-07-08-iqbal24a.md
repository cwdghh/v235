title: Nesting Particle Filters for Experimental Design in Dynamical Systems
openreview: p1kDNFs62o
abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach to Bayesian experimental design
  for non-exchangeable data that formulates it as risk-sensitive policy optimization.
  We develop the Inside-Out SMC$^2$ algorithm, a nested sequential Monte Carlo technique
  to infer optimal designs, and embed it into a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo
  framework to perform gradient-based policy amortization. Our approach is distinct
  from other amortized experimental design techniques, as it does not rely on contrastive
  estimators. Numerical validation on a set of dynamical systems showcases the efficacy
  of our method in comparison to other state-of-the-art strategies.
