title: 'Zero-Sum Positional Differential Games as a Framework for Robust Reinforcement
  Learning: Deep Q-Learning Approach'
openreview: UdXDUDxq11
abstract: Robust Reinforcement Learning (RRL) is a promising Reinforcement Learning
  (RL) paradigm aimed at training robust to uncertainty or disturbances models, making
  them more efficient for real-world applications. Following this paradigm, uncertainty
  or disturbances are interpreted as actions of a second adversarial agent, and thus,
  the problem is reduced to seeking the agents’ policies robust to any opponent’s
  actions. This paper is the first to propose considering the RRL problems within
  the positional differential game theory, which helps us to obtain theoretically
  justified intuition to develop a centralized Q-learning approach. Namely, we prove
  that under Isaacs’s condition (sufficiently general for real-world dynamical systems),
  the same Q-function can be utilized as an approximate solution of both minimax and
  maximin Bellman equations. Based on these results, we present the Isaacs Deep Q-Network
  algorithms and demonstrate their superiority compared to other baseline RRL and
  Multi-Agent RL algorithms in various environments.
