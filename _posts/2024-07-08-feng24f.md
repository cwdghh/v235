title: 'UniCorn: A Unified Contrastive Learning Approach for Multi-view Molecular
  Representation Learning'
openreview: 2NfpFwJfKu
abstract: Recently, a noticeable trend has emerged in developing pre-trained foundation
  models in the domains of CV and NLP. However, for molecular pre-training, there
  lacks a universal model capable of effectively applying to various categories of
  molecular tasks, since existing prevalent pre-training methods exhibit effectiveness
  for specific types of downstream tasks. Furthermore, the lack of profound understanding
  of existing pre-training methods, including 2D graph masking, 2D-3D contrastive
  learning, and 3D denoising, hampers the advancement of molecular foundation models.
  In this work, we provide a unified comprehension of existing pre-training methods
  through the lens of contrastive learning. Thus their distinctions lie in clustering
  different views of molecules, which is shown beneficial to specific downstream tasks.
  To achieve a complete and general-purpose molecular representation, we propose a
  novel pre-training framework, named UniCorn, that inherits the merits of the three
  methods, depicting molecular views in three different levels. SOTA performance across
  quantum, physicochemical, and biological tasks, along with comprehensive ablation
  study, validate the universality and effectiveness of UniCorn.
