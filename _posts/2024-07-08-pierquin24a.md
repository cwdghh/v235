title: 'Rényi Pufferfish Privacy: General Additive Noise Mechanisms and Privacy Amplification
  by Iteration via Shift Reduction Lemmas'
openreview: VZsxhPpu9T
abstract: Pufferfish privacy is a flexible generalization of differential privacy
  that allows to model arbitrary secrets and adversary’s prior knowledge about the
  data. Unfortunately, designing general and tractable Pufferfish mechanisms that
  do not compromise utility is challenging. Furthermore, this framework does not provide
  the composition guarantees needed for a direct use in iterative machine learning
  algorithms. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a Rényi divergence-based variant
  of Pufferfish and show that it allows us to extend the applicability of the Pufferfish
  framework. We first generalize the Wasserstein mechanism to cover a wide range of
  noise distributions and introduce several ways to improve its utility. Finally,
  as an alternative to composition, we prove privacy amplification results for contractive
  noisy iterations and showcase the first use of Pufferfish in private convex optimization.
  A common ingredient underlying our results is the use and extension of shift reduction
  lemmas.
