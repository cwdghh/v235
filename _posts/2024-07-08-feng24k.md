title: 'AquaLoRA: Toward White-box Protection for Customized Stable Diffusion Models
  via Watermark LoRA'
openreview: 8xKGZsnV2a
abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality
  images. Recently, the open-source models represented by Stable Diffusion (SD) are
  thriving and are accessible for customization, giving rise to a vibrant community
  of creators and enthusiasts. However, the widespread availability of customized
  SD models has led to copyright concerns, like unauthorized model distribution and
  unconsented commercial use. To address it, recent works aim to let SD models output
  watermarked content for post-hoc forensics. Unfortunately, none of them can achieve
  the challenging white-box protection, wherein the malicious user can easily remove
  or replace the watermarking module to fail the subsequent verification. For this,
  we propose AquaLoRA as the first implementation under this scenario. Briefly, we
  merge watermark information into the U-Net of Stable Diffusion Models via a watermark
  LowRank Adaptation (LoRA) module in a two-stage manner. For watermark LoRA module,
  we devise a scaling matrix to achieve flexible message updates without retraining.
  To guarantee fidelity, we design Prior Preserving Fine-Tuning (PPFT) to ensure watermark
  learning with minimal impacts on model distribution, validated by proofs. Finally,
  we conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify our design. Our
  code is available at github.com/Georgefwt/AquaLoRA.
