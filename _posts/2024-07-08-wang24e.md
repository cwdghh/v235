title: Towards Theoretical Understanding of Learning Large-scale Dependent Data via
  Random Features
openreview: eY4jrFe6Qc
abstract: Random feature (RF) mapping is an attractive and powerful technique for
  solving large-scale nonparametric regression. Yet, the existing theoretical analysis
  crucially relies on the i.i.d. assumption that individuals in the data are independent
  and identically distributed. It is still unclear whether learning accuracy would
  be compromised when the i.i.d. assumption is violated. This paper aims to provide
  theoretical understanding of the kernel ridge regression (KRR) with RFs for large-scale
  dependent data. Specifically, we consider two types of data dependence structure,
  namely, the $\tau$-mixing process with exponential decay coefficient, and that with
  polynomial decay coefficient. Theoretically, we prove that the kernel ridge estimator
  with RFs achieves the minimax optimality under the exponential decay scenario, but
  yields a sub-optimal result under the polynomial decay case. Our analysis further
  reveals how the decay rate of the $\tau$-mixing coefficient impacts the learning
  accuracy of the kernel ridge estimator with RFs. Extensive numerical experiments
  on both synthetic and real examples further validate our theoretical findings and
  support the effectiveness of the KRR with RFs in dealing with dependent data.
