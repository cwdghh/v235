title: Revisiting Character-level Adversarial Attacks for Language Models
openreview: AZWqXfM6z9
abstract: Adversarial attacks in Natural Language Processing apply perturbations in
  the character or token levels. Token-level attacks, gaining prominence for their
  use of gradient-based methods, are susceptible to altering sentence semantics, leading
  to invalid adversarial examples. While character-level attacks easily maintain semantics,
  they have received less attention as they cannot easily adopt popular gradient-based
  methods, and are thought to be easy to defend. Challenging these beliefs, we introduce
  Charmer, an efficient query-based adversarial attack capable of achieving high attack
  success rate (ASR) while generating highly similar adversarial examples. Our method
  successfully targets both small (BERT) and large (Llama 2) models. Specifically,
  on BERT with SST-2, Charmer improves the ASR in $4.84$% points and the USE similarity
  in $8$% points with respect to the previous art. Our implementation is available
  in https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/Charmer.
