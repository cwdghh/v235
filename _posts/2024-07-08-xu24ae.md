title: Out-of-Distribution Detection via Deep Multi-Comprehension Ensemble
openreview: HusShERjlc
abstract: Recent research works demonstrate that one of the significant factors for
  the model Out-of-Distirbution detection performance is the scale of the OOD feature
  representation field. Consequently, model ensemble emerges as a trending method
  to expand this feature representation field leveraging expected model diversity.
  However, by proposing novel qualitative and quantitative model ensemble evaluation
  methods (i.e., Loss Basin/Barrier Visualization and Self-Coupling Index), we reveal
  that the previous ensemble methods incorporate affine-transformable weights with
  limited variability and fail to provide desired feature representation diversity.
  Therefore, we escalate the traditional model ensemble dimensions (different weight
  initialization, data holdout, etc.) into distinct supervision tasks, which we name
  as Multi-Comprehension (MC) Ensemble. MC Ensemble leverages various training tasks
  to form different comprehensions of the data and labels, resulting in the extension
  of the feature representation field. In experiments, we demonstrate the superior
  performance of the MC Ensemble strategy in the OOD detection task compared to both
  the naive Deep Ensemble method and the standalone model of comparable size.
