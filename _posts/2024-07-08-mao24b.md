title: Towards General Neural Surrogate Solvers with Specialized Neural Accelerators
openreview: FNKnLhLuhY
abstract: Surrogate neural network-based partial differential equation (PDE) solvers
  have the potential to solve PDEs in an accelerated manner, but they are largely
  limited to systems featuring fixed domain sizes, geometric layouts, and boundary
  conditions. We propose Specialized Neural Accelerator-Powered Domain Decomposition
  Methods (SNAP-DDM), a DDM-based approach to PDE solving in which subdomain problems
  containing arbitrary boundary conditions and geometric parameters are accurately
  solved using an ensemble of specialized neural operators. We tailor SNAP-DDM to
  2D electromagnetics and fluidic flow problems and show how innovations in network
  architecture and loss function engineering can produce specialized surrogate subdomain
  solvers with near unity accuracy. We utilize these solvers with standard DDM algorithms
  to accurately solve freeform electromagnetics and fluids problems featuring a wide
  range of domain sizes.
