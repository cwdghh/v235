title: Generalization Error of Graph Neural Networks in the Mean-field Regime
openreview: 8h0x12p3zq
abstract: 'This work provides a theoretical framework for assessing the generalization
  error of graph neural networks in the over-parameterized regime, where the number
  of parameters surpasses the quantity of data points. We explore two widely utilized
  types of graph neural networks: graph convolutional neural networks and message
  passing graph neural networks. Prior to this study, existing bounds on the generalization
  error in the over-parametrized regime were uninformative, limiting our understanding
  of over-parameterized network performance. Our novel approach involves deriving
  upper bounds within the mean-field regime for evaluating the generalization error
  of these graph neural networks. We establish upper bounds with a convergence rate
  of $O(1/n)$, where $n$ is the number of graph samples. These upper bounds offer
  a theoretical assurance of the networksâ€™ performance on unseen data in the challenging
  over-parameterized regime and overall contribute to our understanding of their performance.'
