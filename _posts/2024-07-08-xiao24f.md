title: Temporal Spiking Neural Networks with Synaptic Delay for Graph Reasoning
openreview: 3FeYlKIPr3
abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are investigated as biologically inspired
  models of neural computation, distinguished by their computational capability and
  energy efficiency due to precise spiking times and sparse spikes with event-driven
  computation. A significant question is how SNNs can emulate human-like graph-based
  reasoning of concepts and relations, especially leveraging the temporal domain optimally.
  This paper reveals that SNNs, when amalgamated with synaptic delay and temporal
  coding, are proficient in executing (knowledge) graph reasoning. It is elucidated
  that spiking time can function as an additional dimension to encode relation properties
  via a neural-generalized path formulation. Empirical results highlight the efficacy
  of temporal delay in relation processing and showcase exemplary performance in diverse
  graph reasoning tasks. The spiking model is theoretically estimated to achieve $20\times$
  energy savings compared to non-spiking counterparts, deepening insights into the
  capabilities and potential of biologically inspired SNNs for efficient reasoning.
