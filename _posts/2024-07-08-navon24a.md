title: Equivariant Deep Weight Space Alignment
openreview: nBPnmk6EeO
abstract: Permutation symmetries of deep networks make basic operations like model
  merging and similarity estimation challenging. In many cases, aligning the weights
  of the networks, i.e., finding optimal permutations between their weights, is necessary.
  Unfortunately, weight alignment is an NP-hard problem. Prior research has mainly
  focused on solving relaxed versions of the alignment problem, leading to either
  time-consuming methods or sub-optimal solutions. To accelerate the alignment process
  and improve its quality, we propose a novel framework aimed at learning to solve
  the weight alignment problem, which we name Deep-Align. To that end, we first prove
  that weight alignment adheres to two fundamental symmetries and then, propose a
  deep architecture that respects these symmetries. Notably, our framework does not
  require any labeled data. We provide a theoretical analysis of our approach and
  evaluate Deep-Align on several types of network architectures and learning setups.
  Our experimental results indicate that a feed-forward pass with Deep-Align produces
  better or equivalent alignments compared to those produced by current optimization
  algorithms. Additionally, our alignments can be used as an effective initialization
  for other methods, leading to improved solutions with a significant speedup in convergence.
