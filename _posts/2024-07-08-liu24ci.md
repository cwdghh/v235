title: Pairwise Alignment Improves Graph Domain Adaptation
openreview: ttnbM598vZ
abstract: Graph-based methods, pivotal for label inference over interconnected objects
  in many real-world applications, often encounter generalization challenges, if the
  graph used for model training differs significantly from the graph used for testing.
  This work delves into Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) to address the unique complexities
  of distribution shifts over graph data, where interconnected data points experience
  shifts in features, labels, and in particular, connecting patterns. We propose a
  novel, theoretically principled method, Pairwise Alignment (Pair-Align) to counter
  graph structure shift by mitigating conditional structure shift (CSS) and label
  shift (LS). Pair-Align uses edge weights to recalibrate the influence among neighboring
  nodes to handle CSS and adjusts the classification loss with label weights to handle
  LS. Our method demonstrates superior performance in real-world applications, including
  node classification with region shift in social networks, and the pileup mitigation
  task in particle colliding experiments. For the first application, we also curate
  the largest dataset by far for GDA studies. Our method shows strong performance
  in synthetic and other existing benchmark datasets.
