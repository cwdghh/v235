title: 'Weakly Convex Regularisers for Inverse Problems: Convergence of Critical Points
  and Primal-Dual Optimisation'
openreview: E8FpcUyPuS
abstract: Variational regularisation is the primary method for solving inverse problems,
  and recently there has been considerable work leveraging deeply learned regularisation
  for enhanced performance. However, few results exist addressing the convergence
  of such regularisation, particularly within the context of critical points as opposed
  to global minimisers. In this paper, we present a generalised formulation of convergent
  regularisation in terms of critical points, and show that this is achieved by a
  class of weakly convex regularisers. We prove convergence of the primal-dual hybrid
  gradient method for the associated variational problem, and, given a Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz
  condition, an $\mathcal{O}(\log{k}/k)$ ergodic convergence rate. Finally, applying
  this theory to learned regularisation, we prove universal approximation for input
  weakly convex neural networks (IWCNN), and show empirically that IWCNNs can lead
  to improved performance of learned adversarial regularisers for computed tomography
  (CT) reconstruction.
