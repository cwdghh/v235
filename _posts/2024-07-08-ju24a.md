title: Hypergraph-enhanced Dual Semi-supervised Graph Classification
openreview: M5ne8enLcr
abstract: In this paper, we study semi-supervised graph classification, which aims
  at accurately predicting the categories of graphs in scenarios with limited labeled
  graphs and abundant unlabeled graphs. Despite the promising capability of graph
  neural networks (GNNs), they typically require a large number of costly labeled
  graphs, while a wealth of unlabeled graphs fail to be effectively utilized. Moreover,
  GNNs are inherently limited to encoding local neighborhood information using message-passing
  mechanisms, thus lacking the ability to model higher-order dependencies among nodes.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose a Hypergraph-Enhanced DuAL framework named
  HEAL for semi-supervised graph classification, which captures graph semantics from
  the perspective of the hypergraph and the line graph, respectively. Specifically,
  to better explore the higher-order relationships among nodes, we design a hypergraph
  structure learning to adaptively learn complex node dependencies beyond pairwise
  relations. Meanwhile, based on the learned hypergraph, we introduce a line graph
  to capture the interaction between hyperedges, thereby better mining the underlying
  semantic structures. Finally, we develop a relational consistency learning to facilitate
  knowledge transfer between the two branches and provide better mutual guidance.
  Extensive experiments on real-world graph datasets verify the effectiveness of the
  proposed method against existing state-of-the-art methods.
