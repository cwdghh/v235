title: Exploring the Complexity of Deep Neural Networks through Functional Equivalence
openreview: QgMqvxvWpX
abstract: We investigate the complexity of deep neural networks through the lens of
  functional equivalence, which posits that different parameterizations can yield
  the same network function. Leveraging the equivalence property, we present a novel
  bound on the covering number for deep neural networks, which reveals that the complexity
  of neural networks can be reduced. Additionally, we demonstrate that functional
  equivalence benefits optimization, as overparameterized networks tend to be easier
  to train since increasing network width leads to a diminishing volume of the effective
  parameter space. These findings can offer valuable insights into the phenomenon
  of overparameterization and have implications for understanding generalization and
  optimization in deep learning.
