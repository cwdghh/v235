title: Autoformalizing Euclidean Geometry
openreview: bylZbZOsGA
abstract: Autoformalization involves automatically translating informal math into
  formal theorems and proofs that are machine-verifiable. Euclidean geometry provides
  an interesting and controllable domain for studying autoformalization. In this paper,
  we introduce a neuro-symbolic framework for autoformalizing Euclidean geometry,
  which combines domain knowledge, SMT solvers, and large language models (LLMs).
  One challenge in Euclidean geometry is that informal proofs rely on diagrams, leaving
  gaps in texts that are hard to formalize. To address this issue, we use theorem
  provers to fill in such diagrammatic information automatically, so that the LLM
  only needs to autoformalize the explicit textual steps, making it easier for the
  model. We also provide automatic semantic evaluation for autoformalized theorem
  statements. We construct LeanEuclid, an autoformalization benchmark consisting of
  problems from Euclidâ€™s Elements and the UniGeo dataset formalized in the Lean proof
  assistant. Experiments with GPT-4 and GPT-4V show the capability and limitations
  of state-of-the-art LLMs on autoformalizing geometry problems. The data and code
  are available at https://github.com/loganrjmurphy/LeanEuclid.
