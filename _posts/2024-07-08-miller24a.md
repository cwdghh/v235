title: 'FlowMM: Generating Materials with Riemannian Flow Matching'
openreview: W4pB7VbzZI
abstract: 'Crystalline materials are a fundamental component in next-generation technologies,
  yet modeling their distribution presents unique computational challenges. Of the
  plausible arrangements of atoms in a periodic lattice only a vanishingly small percentage
  are thermodynamically stable, which is a key indicator of the materials that can
  be experimentally realized. Two fundamental tasks in this area are to (a) predict
  the stable crystal structure of a known composition of elements and (b) propose
  novel compositions along with their stable structures. We present FlowMM, a pair
  of generative models that achieve state-of-the-art performance on both tasks while
  being more efficient and more flexible than competing methods. We extend Riemannian
  Flow Matching to suit the symmetries inherent to crystals: translation, rotation,
  permutation, and periodic boundary conditions. Our framework enables the freedom
  to choose the flow base distributions, drastically simplifying the problem of learning
  crystal structures compared with diffusion models. In addition to standard benchmarks,
  we validate FlowMMâ€™s generated structures with quantum chemistry calculations, demonstrating
  that it is $\sim$3x more efficient, in terms of integration steps, at finding stable
  materials compared to previous open methods.'
