title: 'Position: $C^*$-Algebraic Machine Learning $-$ Moving in a New Direction'
openreview: w9nxTXuaCc
abstract: 'Machine learning has a long collaborative tradition with several fields
  of mathematics, such as statistics, probability and linear algebra. We propose a
  new direction for machine learning research: $C^*$-algebraic ML $-$ a cross-fertilization
  between $C^*$-algebra and machine learning. The mathematical concept of $C^*$-algebra
  is a natural generalization of the space of complex numbers. It enables us to unify
  existing learning strategies, and construct a new framework for more diverse and
  information-rich data models. We explain why and how to use $C^*$-algebras in machine
  learning, and provide technical considerations that go into the design of $C^*$-algebraic
  learning models in the contexts of kernel methods and neural networks. Furthermore,
  we discuss open questions and challenges in $C^*$-algebraic ML and give our thoughts
  for future development and applications.'
