title: Learning Adaptive and View-Invariant Vision Transformer for Real-Time UAV Tracking
openreview: eaNLvrP8n1
abstract: 'Harnessing transformer-based models, visual tracking has made substantial
  strides. However, the sluggish performance of current trackers limits their practicality
  on devices with constrained computational capabilities, especially for real-time
  unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking. Addressing this challenge, we introduce
  AVTrack, an adaptive computation framework tailored to selectively activate transformer
  blocks for real-time UAV tracking in this work. Our novel Activation Module (AM)
  dynamically optimizes ViT architecture, selectively engaging relevant components
  and enhancing inference efficiency without compromising much tracking performance.
  Moreover, we bolster the effectiveness of ViTs, particularly in addressing challenges
  arising from extreme changes in viewing angles commonly encountered in UAV tracking,
  by learning view-invariant representations through mutual information maximization.
  Extensive experiments on five tracking benchmarks affirm the effectiveness and versatility
  of our approach, positioning it as a state-of-the-art solution in visual tracking.
