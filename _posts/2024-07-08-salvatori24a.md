title: Predictive Coding beyond Correlations
openreview: nTgzmXvuEA
abstract: Biologically plausible learning algorithms offer a promising alternative
  to traditional deep learning techniques, especially in overcoming the limitations
  of backpropagation in fast and low-energy neuromorphic implementations. To this
  end, there has been extensive research in understanding what their capabilities
  are. In this work, we show how one of such algorithms, called predictive coding,
  is able to perform causal inference tasks. First, we show how a simple change in
  the inference process of predictive coding enables to compute interventions without
  the need to mutilate or redefine a causal graph. Then, we explore applications in
  cases where the graph is unknown, and has to be inferred from observational data.
  Empirically, we show how such findings can be used to improve the performance of
  predictive coding in image classification tasks, and conclude that such models are
  naturally able to perform causal inference tasks using a biologically plausible
  kind of message passing.
