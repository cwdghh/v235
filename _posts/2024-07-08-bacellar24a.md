title: Differentiable Weightless Neural Networks
openreview: GBxflz0qdX
abstract: 'We introduce the Differentiable Weightless Neural Network (DWN), a model
  based on interconnected lookup tables. Training of DWNs is enabled by a novel Extended
  Finite Difference technique for approximate differentiation of binary values. We
  propose Learnable Mapping, Learnable Reduction, and Spectral Regularization to further
  improve the accuracy and efficiency of these models. We evaluate DWNs in three edge
  computing contexts: (1) an FPGA-based hardware accelerator, where they demonstrate
  superior latency, throughput, energy efficiency, and model area compared to state-of-the-art
  solutions, (2) a low-power microcontroller, where they achieve preferable accuracy
  to XGBoost while subject to stringent memory constraints, and (3) ultra-low-cost
  chips, where they consistently outperform small models in both accuracy and projected
  hardware area. DWNs also compare favorably against leading approaches for tabular
  datasets, with higher average rank. Overall, our work positions DWNs as a pioneering
  solution for edge-compatible high-throughput neural networks.'
