title: Self-Supervised Coarsening of Unstructured Grid with Automatic Differentiation
openreview: kMBvZ40Iu9
abstract: 'Due to the high computational load of modern numerical simulation, there
  is a demand for approaches that would reduce the size of discrete problems while
  keeping the accuracy reasonable. In this work, we present an original algorithm
  to coarsen an unstructured grid based on the concepts of differentiable physics.
  We achieve this by employing $k$-means clustering, autodifferentiation and stochastic
  minimization algorithms. We demonstrate performance of the designed algorithm on
  two PDEs: a linear parabolic equation which governs slightly compressible fluid
  flow in porous media and the wave equation. Our results show that in the considered
  scenarios, we reduced the number of grid points up to 10 times while preserving
  the modeled variable dynamics in the points of interest. The proposed approach can
  be applied to the simulation of an arbitrary system described by evolutionary partial
  differential equations.'
