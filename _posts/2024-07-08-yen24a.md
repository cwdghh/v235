title: Adaptive Sampling of k-Space in Magnetic Resonance for Rapid Pathology Prediction
openreview: h2uBuQvpp8
abstract: Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, despite its proven diagnostic utility,
  remains an inaccessible imaging modality for disease surveillance at the population
  level. A major factor rendering MR inaccessible is lengthy scan times. An MR scanner
  collects measurements associated with the underlying anatomy in the Fourier space,
  also known as the k-space. Creating a high-fidelity image requires collecting large
  quantities of such measurements, increasing the scan time. Traditionally to accelerate
  an MR scan, image reconstruction from under-sampled k-space data is the method of
  choice. However, recent works show the feasibility of bypassing image reconstruction
  and directly learning to detect disease directly from a sparser learned subset of
  the k-space measurements. In this work, we propose Adaptive Sampling for MR (ASMR),
  a sampling method that learns an adaptive policy to sequentially select k-space
  samples to optimize for target disease detection. On 6 out of 8 pathology classification
  tasks spanning the Knee, Brain, and Prostate MR scans, ASMR reaches within 2% of
  the performance of a fully sampled classifier while using only 8% of the k-space,
  as well as outperforming prior state-of-the-art work in k-space sampling such as
  EMRT, LOUPE, and DPS.
