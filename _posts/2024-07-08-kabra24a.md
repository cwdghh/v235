title: Leveraging VLM-Based Pipelines to Annotate 3D Objects
openreview: 5Pcl5qOOfL
abstract: Pretrained vision language models (VLMs) present an opportunity to caption
  unlabeled 3D objects at scale. The leading approach to summarize VLM descriptions
  from different views of an object (Luo et al., 2023) relies on a language model
  (GPT4) to produce the final output. This text-based aggregation is susceptible to
  hallucinations as it merges potentially contradictory descriptions. We propose an
  alternative algorithm to marginalize over factors such as the viewpoint that affect
  the VLM’s response. Instead of merging text-only responses, we utilize the VLM’s
  joint image-text likelihoods. We show our probabilistic aggregation is not only
  more reliable and efficient, but sets the SoTA on inferring object types with respect
  to human-verified labels. The aggregated annotations are also useful for conditional
  inference; they improve downstream predictions (e.g., of object material) when the
  object’s type is specified as an auxiliary text-based input. Such auxiliary inputs
  allow ablating the contribution of visual reasoning over visionless reasoning in
  an unsupervised setting. With these supervised and unsupervised evaluations, we
  show how a VLM-based pipeline can be leveraged to produce reliable annotations for
  764K objects from the Objaverse dataset.
