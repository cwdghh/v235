title: 'Machine Vision Therapy: Multimodal Large Language Models Can Enhance Visual
  Robustness via Denoising In-Context Learning'
openreview: LwOfVWgEzS
abstract: Although pre-trained models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training
  (CLIP) show impressive generalization results, their robustness is still limited
  under Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. Instead of undesirably leveraging human
  annotation as commonly done, it is possible to leverage the visual understanding
  power of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, MLLMs struggle with
  vision problems due to task incompatibility, thus hindering their effectiveness.
  In this paper, we propose to effectively leverage MLLMs via Machine Vision Therapy
  which aims to rectify erroneous predictions of specific vision models. By supervising
  vision models using MLLM predictions, visual robustness can be boosted in a nearly
  unsupervised manner. Moreover, we propose a Denoising In-Context Learning (DICL)
  strategy to solve the incompatibility issue. Concretely, by examining the noise
  probability of each example through a transition matrix, we construct an instruction
  containing a correct exemplar and a probable erroneous one, which enables MLLMs
  to detect and rectify the incorrect predictions of vision models. Under mild assumptions,
  we theoretically show that our DICL method is guaranteed to find the ground truth.
  Through extensive experiments on various OOD datasets, our method demonstrates powerful
  capabilities for enhancing visual robustness under many OOD scenarios.
