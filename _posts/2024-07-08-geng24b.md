title: Reinforcement Learning within Tree Search for Fast Macro Placement
openreview: AJGwSx0RUV
abstract: Macro placement is a crucial step in modern chip design, and reinforcement
  learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising technique for improving the placement
  quality. However, existing RL-based techniques are hindered by their low sample
  efficiency, requiring numerous online rollouts or substantial offline expert data
  to achieve bootstrap, which are often impractical in industrial scenarios. To address
  this challenge, we propose a novel sample-efficient framework, namely <b>EfficientPlace</b>,
  for fast macro placement. EfficientPlace integrates a global tree search algorithm
  to strategically direct the optimization process, as well as a RL agent for local
  policy learning to advance the tree search. Experiments on commonly used benchmarks
  demonstrate that EfficientPlace achieves remarkable placement quality within a short
  timeframe, outperforming recent state-of-the-art approaches.
