title: Interacting Diffusion Processes for Event Sequence Forecasting
openreview: CQH63IbI5o
abstract: Neural Temporal Point Processes (TPPs) have emerged as the primary framework
  for predicting sequences of events that occur at irregular time intervals, but their
  sequential nature can hamper performance for long-horizon forecasts. To address
  this, we introduce a novel approach that incorporates a diffusion generative model.
  The model facilitates sequence-to-sequence prediction, allowing multi-step predictions
  based on historical event sequences. In contrast to previous approaches, our model
  directly learns the joint probability distribution of types and inter-arrival times
  for multiple events. The model is composed of two diffusion processes, one for the
  time intervals and one for the event types. These processes interact through their
  respective denoising functions, which can take as input intermediate representations
  from both processes, allowing the model to learn complex interactions. We demonstrate
  that our proposal outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for long-horizon forecasting
  of TPPs.
