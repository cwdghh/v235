title: Provably Neural Active Learning Succeeds via Prioritizing Perplexing Samples
openreview: kzz0kn546b
abstract: 'Neural Network-based active learning (NAL) is a cost-effective data selection
  technique that utilizes neural networks to select and train on a small subset of
  samples. While existing work successfully develops various effective or theory-justified
  NAL algorithms, the understanding of the two commonly used query criteria of NAL:
  uncertainty-based and diversity-based, remains in its infancy. In this work, we
  try to move one step forward by offering a unified explanation for the success of
  both query criteria-based NAL from a feature learning view. Specifically, we consider
  a feature-noise data model comprising easy-to-learn or hard-to-learn features disrupted
  by noise, and conduct analysis over 2-layer NN-based NALs in the pool-based scenario.
  We provably show that both uncertainty-based and diversity-based NAL are inherently
  amenable to one and the same principle, i.e., striving to prioritize samples that
  contain yet-to-be-learned features. We further prove that this shared principle
  is the key to their success-achieve small test error within a small labeled set.
  Contrastingly, the strategy-free passive learning exhibits a large test error due
  to the inadequate learning of yet-to-be-learned features, necessitating resort to
  a significantly larger label complexity for a sufficient test error reduction. Experimental
  results validate our findings.'
