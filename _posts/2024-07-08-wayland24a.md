title: Mapping the Multiverse of Latent Representations
openreview: SPBxFwIdMk
abstract: Echoing recent calls to counter reliability and robustness concerns in machine
  learning via <em>multiverse analysis</em>, we present PRESTO, a principled framework
  for <em>mapping the multiverse</em> of machine-learning models that rely on <em>latent
  representations</em>. Although such models enjoy widespread adoption, the variability
  in their embeddings remains poorly understood, resulting in unnecessary complexity
  and untrustworthy representations. Our framework uses <em>persistent homology</em>
  to characterize the latent spaces arising from different combinations of diverse
  machine-learning methods, (hyper)parameter configurations, and datasets, allowing
  us to measure their pairwise <em>(dis)similarity</em> and statistically reason about
  their <em>distributions</em>. As we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically,
  our pipeline preserves desirable properties of collections of latent representations,
  and it can be leveraged to perform sensitivity analysis, detect anomalous embeddings,
  or efficiently and effectively navigate hyperparameter search spaces.
