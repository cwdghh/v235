title: 'Keep the Momentum: Conservation Laws beyond Euclidean Gradient Flows'
openreview: hG6gddAKnJ
abstract: 'Conservation laws are well-established in the context of Euclidean gradient
  flow dynamics, notably for linear or ReLU neural network training. Yet, their existence
  and principles for non-Euclidean geometries and momentum-based dynamics remain largely
  unknown. In this paper, we characterize "all" conservation laws in this general
  setting. In stark contrast to the case of gradient flows, we prove that the conservation
  laws for momentum-based dynamics exhibit temporal dependence. Additionally, we often
  observe a "conservation loss" when transitioning from gradient flow to momentum
  dynamics. Specifically, for linear networks, our framework allows us to identify
  all momentum conservation laws, which are less numerous than in the gradient flow
  case except in sufficiently over-parameterized regimes. With ReLU networks, no conservation
  law remains. This phenomenon also manifests in non-Euclidean metrics, used e.g.
  for Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF): all conservation laws can be determined
  in the gradient flow context, yet none persists in the momentum case.'
