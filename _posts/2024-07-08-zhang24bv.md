title: 'Minimax Optimality of Score-based Diffusion Models: Beyond the Density Lower
  Bound Assumptions'
openreview: wTd7dogTsB
abstract: We study the asymptotic error of score-based diffusion model sampling in
  large-sample scenarios from a non-parametric statistics perspective. We show that
  a kernel-based score estimator achieves an optimal mean square error of $\widetilde{O}\left(n^{-1}
  t^{-\frac{d+2}{2}}(t^{\frac{d}{2}} \vee 1)\right)$ for the score function of $p_0*\mathcal{N}(0,t\boldsymbol{I}_d)$,
  where $n$ and $d$ represent the sample size and the dimension, $t$ is bounded above
  and below by polynomials of $n$, and $p_0$ is an arbitrary sub-Gaussian distribution.
  As a consequence, this yields an $\widetilde{O}\left(n^{-1/2} t^{-\frac{d}{4}}\right)$
  upper bound for the total variation error of the distribution of the sample generated
  by the diffusion model under a mere sub-Gaussian assumption. If in addition, $p_0$
  belongs to the nonparametric family of the $\beta$-Sobolev space with $\beta\le
  2$, by adopting an early stopping strategy, we obtain that the diffusion model is
  nearly (up to log factors) minimax optimal. This removes the crucial lower bound
  assumption on $p_0$ in previous proofs of the minimax optimality of the diffusion
  model for nonparametric families.
