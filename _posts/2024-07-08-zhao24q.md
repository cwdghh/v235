title: 'CompeteAI: Understanding the Competition Dynamics of Large Language Model-based
  Agents'
openreview: wGtzp4ZT1n
abstract: 'Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used as agents to complete
  different tasks, such as personal assistance or event planning. Although most of
  the work has focused on cooperation and collaboration between agents, little work
  explores <em>competition</em>, another important mechanism that promotes the development
  of society and economy. In this paper, we seek to examine the competition dynamics
  in LLM-based agents. We first propose a general framework for studying the competition
  between agents. Then, we implement a practical competitive environment using GPT-4
  to simulate a virtual town with two types of agents, including restaurant agents
  and customer agents. Specifically, the restaurant agents compete with each other
  to attract more customers, where competition encourages them to transform, such
  as cultivating new operating strategies. Simulation experiments reveal several interesting
  findings at the micro and macro levels, which align well with existing market and
  sociological theories. We hope that the framework and environment can be a promising
  testbed to study the competition that fosters understanding of society. Code is
