title: Ranking-based Client Imitation Selection for Efficient Federated Learning
openreview: FMEhnS0948
abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple devices to collaboratively train
  a shared model while ensuring data privacy. The selection of participating devices
  in each training round critically affects both the model performance and training
  efficiency, especially given the vast heterogeneity in training capabilities and
  data distribution across devices. To deal with these challenges, we introduce a
  novel device selection solution called FedRank, which is based on an end-to-end,
  ranking-based model that is pre-trained by imitation learning against state-of-the-art
  analytical approaches. It not only considers data and system heterogeneity at runtime
  but also adaptively and efficiently chooses the most suitable clients for model
  training. Specifically, FedRank views client selection in FL as a ranking problem
  and employs a pairwise training strategy for the smart selection process. Additionally,
  an imitation learning-based approach is designed to counteract the cold-start issues
  often seen in state-of-the-art learning-based approaches. Experimental results reveal
  that FedRank boosts model accuracy by 5.2% to 56.9%, accelerates the training convergence
  up to $2.01 \times$ and saves the energy consumption up to 40.1%.
