title: Sample-specific Masks for Visual Reprogramming-based Prompting
openreview: 4sikyurTLX
abstract: "<em>Visual reprogramming</em> (VR) is a prompting technique that aims to
  re-purpose a pre-trained model (e.g., a classifier on ImageNet) to target tasks
  (e.g., medical data prediction) by learning a <em>small-scale pattern</em> added
  into input images instead of tuning considerable parameters within the model. The
  location of the pattern within input samples is usually determined by a pre-defined
  mask <em>shared across all samples</em>. In this paper, we show that the shared
  mask potentially limits VRâ€™s generalization and increases its approximation error
  due to the lack of sample-level adaptation. Motivated by this finding, we design
  a new framework for VR called <em>sample-specific multi-channel masks</em> (SMM).
  Specifically, SMM employs a lightweight ConvNet and patch-wise interpolation to
  generate sample-specific three-channel masks instead of a shared and pre-defined
  mask. Since we generate different masks for individual samples, SMM is theoretically
  shown to reduce approximation error for the target tasks compared with existing
  state-of-the-art VR methods. We also empirically demonstrate its performance gain
  on both ResNet and ViT. The success of SMM further highlights the broader applicability
  of VR in leveraging the latent knowledge of pre-trained models for various target
  tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/tmlr-group/SMM."
