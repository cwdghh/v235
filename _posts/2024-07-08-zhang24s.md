title: Easing Concept Bleeding in Diffusion via Entity Localization and Anchoring
openreview: MsnJl6JkZS
abstract: Recent diffusion models have manifested extraordinary capabilities in generating
  high-quality, diverse, and innovative images guided by textual prompts. Nevertheless,
  these state-of-the-art models may encounter the challenge of concept bleeding when
  generating images with multiple entities or attributes in the prompt, leading to
  the unanticipated merging or overlapping of distinct objects in the synthesized
  result. The current work exploits auxiliary networks to produce mask-constrained
  regions for entities, necessitating the training of an object detection network.
  In this paper, we investigate the bleeding reason and find that the cross-attention
  map associated with a specific entity or attribute tends to extend beyond its intended
  focus, encompassing the background or other unrelated objects and thereby acting
  as the primary source of concept bleeding. Motivated by this, we propose Entity
  Localization and Anchoring (ELA) to drive the entity to concentrate on the expected
  region accurately during inference, eliminating the necessity for training. Specifically,
  we initially identify the region corresponding to each entity and subsequently employ
  a tailored loss function to anchor entities within their designated positioning
  areas. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior capability in precisely generating
  multiple objects as specified in the textual prompts.
