title: 'Towards General Algorithm Discovery for Combinatorial Optimization: Learning
  Symbolic Branching Policy from Bipartite Graph'
openreview: ULleq1Dtaw
abstract: Machine learning (ML) approaches have been successfully applied to accelerating
  exact combinatorial optimization (CO) solvers. However, many of them fail to explain
  what patterns they have learned that accelerate the CO algorithms due to the black-box
  nature of ML models like neural networks, and thus they prevent researchers from
  further understanding the tasks they are interested in. To tackle this problem,
  we propose the <em>first</em> graph-based algorithm discovery framework—namely,
  graph symbolic discovery for exact combinatorial optimization solver (GS4CO)—that
  learns interpretable branching policies directly from the <em>general</em> bipartite
  graph representation of CO problems. Specifically, we design a unified representation
  for symbolic policies with graph inputs, and then we employ a Transformer with multiple
  tree-structural encodings to generate symbolic trees end-to-end, which effectively
  reduces the cumulative error from iteratively distilling graph neural networks.
  Experiments show that GS4CO learned interpretable and lightweight policies outperform
  all the baselines on CPU machines, including both the human-designed and the learning-based.
  GS4CO shows an encouraging step towards general algorithm discovery on modern CO
  solvers.
