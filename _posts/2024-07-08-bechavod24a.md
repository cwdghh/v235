title: Monotone Individual Fairness
openreview: 6EF0bxcZvT
abstract: We revisit the problem of online learning with individual fairness, where
  an online learner strives to maximize predictive accuracy while ensuring that similar
  individuals are treated similarly. We first extend the frameworks of Gillen et al.
  (2018); Bechavod et al. (2020), which rely on feedback from human auditors regarding
  fairness violations, to allow for auditing schemes that can aggregate feedback from
  any number of auditors, using a rich class we term monotone aggregation functions,
  for which we also prove a useful characterization. Using our generalized framework,
  we present an oracle-efficient algorithm guaranteeing a bound of $\mathcal{O}(T^\frac{3}{4})$
  simultaneously for regret and number of fairness violations. We then study an online
  classification setting where label feedback is available for positively-predicted
  individuals only, and present an algorithm guaranteeing a bound of $\mathcal{O}(T^\frac{5}{6})$
  simultaneously for regret and number of fairness violations. In both settings, our
  algorithms improve on the best known bounds for oracle-efficient algorithms. Furthermore,
  our algorithms offer significant improvements in computational efficiency, greatly
  reducing the number of required calls to an (offline) optimization oracle, as opposed
  to previous algorithms which required $T$ such calls every round.
