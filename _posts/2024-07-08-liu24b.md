title: 'Causal Bandits: The Pareto Optimal Frontier of Adaptivity, a Reduction to
  Linear Bandits, and Limitations around Unknown Marginals'
openreview: U1uKihiG39
abstract: In this work, we investigate the problem of adapting to the presence or
  absence of causal structure in multi-armed bandit problems. In addition to the usual
  reward signal, we assume the learner has access to additional variables, observed
  in each round after acting. When these variables $d$-separate the action from the
  reward, existing work in causal bandits demonstrates that one can achieve strictly
  better (minimax) rates of regret (Lu et al., 2020). Our goal is to adapt to this
  favorable “conditionally benign” structure, if it is present in the environment,
  while simultaneously recovering worst-case minimax regret, if it is not. Notably,
  the learner has no prior knowledge of whether the favorable structure holds. In
  this paper, we establish the Pareto optimal frontier of adaptive rates. We prove
  upper and matching lower bounds on the possible trade-offs in the performance of
  learning in conditionally benign and arbitrary environments, resolving an open question
  raised by Bilodeau et al. (2022). Furthermore, we are the first to obtain instance-dependent
  bounds for causal bandits, by reducing the problem to the linear bandit setting.
  Finally, we examine the common assumption that the marginal distributions of the
  post-action contexts are known and show that a nontrivial estimate is necessary
  for better-than-worst-case minimax rates.
