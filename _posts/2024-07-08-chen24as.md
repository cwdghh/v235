title: Diffusion Model-Augmented Behavioral Cloning
openreview: OnidGtOhg3
abstract: Imitation learning addresses the challenge of learning by observing an expertâ€™s
  demonstrations without access to reward signals from environments. Most existing
  imitation learning methods that do not require interacting with environments either
  model the expert distribution as the conditional probability p(a|s) (e.g., behavioral
  cloning, BC) or the joint probability p(s, a). Despite the simplicity of modeling
  the conditional probability with BC, it usually struggles with generalization. While
  modeling the joint probability can improve generalization performance, the inference
  procedure is often time-consuming, and the model can suffer from manifold overfitting.
  This work proposes an imitation learning framework that benefits from modeling both
  the conditional and joint probability of the expert distribution. Our proposed Diffusion
  Model-Augmented Behavioral Cloning (DBC) employs a diffusion model trained to model
  expert behaviors and learns a policy to optimize both the BC loss (conditional)
  and our proposed diffusion model loss (joint). DBC outperforms baselines in various
  continuous control tasks in navigation, robot arm manipulation, dexterous manipulation,
  and locomotion. We design additional experiments to verify the limitations of modeling
  either the conditional probability or the joint probability of the expert distribution,
  as well as compare different generative models. Ablation studies justify the effectiveness
  of our design choices.
