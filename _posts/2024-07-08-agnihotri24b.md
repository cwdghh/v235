title: 'CosPGD: an efficient white-box adversarial attack for pixel-wise prediction
  tasks'
openreview: CXZqGJonmt
abstract: While neural networks allow highly accurate predictions in many tasks, their
  lack of robustness towards even slight input perturbations often hampers their deployment.
  Adversarial attacks such as the seminal <em>projected gradient descent</em> (PGD)
  offer an effective means to evaluate a model’s robustness and dedicated solutions
  have been proposed for attacks on semantic segmentation or optical flow estimation.
  While they attempt to increase the attack’s efficiency, a further objective is to
  balance its effect, so that it acts on the entire image domain instead of isolated
  point-wise predictions. This often comes at the cost of optimization stability and
  thus efficiency. Here, we propose CosPGD, an attack that encourages more balanced
  errors over the entire image domain while increasing the attack’s overall efficiency.
  To this end, CosPGD leverages a simple alignment score computed from any pixel-wise
  prediction and its target to scale the loss in a smooth and fully differentiable
  way. It leads to efficient evaluations of a model’s robustness for semantic segmentation
  as well as regression models (such as optical flow, disparity estimation, or image
  restoration), and it allows it to outperform the previous SotA attack on semantic
  segmentation. We provide code for the CosPGD algorithm and example usage at https://github.com/shashankskagnihotri/cospgd.
