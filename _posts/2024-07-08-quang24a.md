title: Augmenting Decision with Hypothesis in Reinforcement Learning
openreview: NeO2hoSexj
abstract: Value-based reinforcement learning is the current State-Of-The-Art due to
  high sampling efficiency. However, our study shows it suffers from low exploitation
  in early training period and bias sensitiveness. To address these issues, we propose
  to augment the decision-making process with hypothesis, a weak form of environment
  description. Our approach relies on prompting the learning agent with accurate hypotheses,
  and designing a ready-to-adapt policy through incremental learning. We propose the
  ALH algorithm, showing detailed analyses on a typical learning scheme and a diverse
  set of Mujoco benchmarks. Our algorithm produces a significant improvement over
  value-based learning algorithms and other strong baselines. Our code is available
  at Github URL.
