title: 'Video-LaVIT: Unified Video-Language Pre-training with Decoupled Visual-Motional
  Tokenization'
openreview: S9lk6dk4LL
abstract: In light of recent advances in multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs),
  there is increasing attention to scaling them from image-text data to more informative
  real-world videos. Compared to static images, video poses unique challenges for
  effective large-scale pre-training due to the modeling of its spatiotemporal dynamics.
  In this paper, we address such limitations in video-language pre-training with an
  efficient video decomposition that represents each video as keyframes and temporal
  motions. These are then adapted to an LLM using well-designed tokenizers that discretize
  visual and temporal information as a few tokens, thus enabling unified generative
  pre-training of videos, images, and text. At inference, the generated tokens from
  the LLM are carefully recovered to the original continuous pixel space to create
  various video content. Our proposed framework is both capable of comprehending and
  generating image and video content, as demonstrated by its competitive performance
  across 13 multimodal benchmarks in image and video understanding and generation.
