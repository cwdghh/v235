title: 'RoboCodeX: Multimodal Code Generation for Robotic Behavior Synthesis'
openreview: xnQ1qoly7Q
abstract: Robotic behavior synthesis, the problem of understanding multimodal inputs
  and generating precise physical control for robots, is an important part of Embodied
  AI. Despite successes in applying multimodal large language models for high-level
  understanding, it remains challenging to translate these conceptual understandings
  into detailed robotic actions while achieving generalization across various scenarios.
  In this paper, we propose a tree-structured multimodal code generation framework
  for generalized robotic behavior synthesis, termed RoboCodeX. RoboCodeX decomposes
  high-level human instructions into multiple object-centric manipulation units consisting
  of physical preferences such as affordance and safety constraints, and applies code
  generation to introduce generalization ability across various robotics platforms.
  To further enhance the capability to map conceptual and perceptual understanding
  into control commands, a specialized multimodal reasoning dataset is collected for
  pre-training and an iterative self-updating methodology is introduced for supervised
  fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboCodeX achieves state-of-the-art
  performance in both simulators and real robots on four different kinds of manipulation
  tasks and one embodied navigation task.
