title: 'Covert Malicious Finetuning: Challenges in Safeguarding LLM Adaptation'
openreview: 6PqWuSuWvX
abstract: Black-box finetuning is an emerging interface for adapting state-of-the-art
  language models to user needs. However, such access may also let malicious actors
  undermine model safety. To demonstrate the challenge of defending finetuning interfaces,
  we introduce covert malicious finetuning, a method to compromise model safety via
  finetuning while evading detection. Our method constructs a malicious dataset where
  every individual datapoint appears innocuous, but finetuning on the dataset teaches
  the model to respond to encoded harmful requests with encoded harmful responses.
  Applied to GPT-4, our method produces a finetuned model that acts on harmful instructions
  99% of the time and avoids detection by defense mechanisms such as dataset inspection,
  safety evaluations, and input/output classifiers. Our findings question whether
  black-box finetuning access can be secured against sophisticated adversaries.
