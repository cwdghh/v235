title: Clifford-Steerable Convolutional Neural Networks
openreview: XTglHJjzQI
abstract: We present Clifford-Steerable Convolutional Neural Networks (CS-CNNs), a
  novel class of ${\operatorname{E}}(p, q)$-equivariant CNNs. CS-CNNs process multivector
  fields on pseudo-Euclidean spaces $\mathbb{R}^{p,q}$. They specialize, for instance,
  to ${\operatorname{E}}(3)$-equivariance on $\mathbb{R}^3$ and Poincaré-equivariance
  on Minkowski spacetime $\mathbb{R}^{1,3}$. Our approach is based on an implicit
  parametrization of ${\operatorname{O}}(p,q)$-steerable kernels via Clifford group
  equivariant neural networks. We significantly and consistently outperform baseline
  methods on fluid dynamics as well as relativistic electrodynamics forecasting tasks.
