title: Self-Driven Entropy Aggregation for Byzantine-Robust Heterogeneous Federated
  Learning
openreview: k2axqNsVVO
abstract: 'Federated learning presents massive potential for privacy-friendly collaboration.
  However, the performance of federated learning is deeply affected by byzantine attacks,
  where malicious clients deliberately upload crafted vicious updates. While various
  robust aggregations have been proposed to defend against such attacks, they are
  subject to certain assumptions: homogeneous private data and related proxy datasets.
  To address these limitations, we propose Self-Driven Entropy Aggregation (SDEA),
  which leverages the random public dataset to conduct Byzantine-robust aggregation
  in heterogeneous federated learning. For Byzantine attackers, we observe that benign
  ones typically present more confident (sharper) predictions than evils on the public
  dataset. Thus, we highlight benign clients by introducing learnable aggregation
  weight to minimize the instance-prediction entropy of the global model on the random
  public dataset. Besides, with inherent data heterogeneity in federated learning,
  we reveal that it brings heterogeneous sharpness. Specifically, clients are optimized
  under distinct distribution and thus present fruitful predictive preferences. The
  learnable aggregation weight blindly allocates high attention to limited ones for
  sharper predictions, resulting in a biased global model. To alleviate this problem,
  we encourage the global model to offer diverse predictions via batch-prediction
  entropy maximization and conduct clustering to equally divide honest weights to
  accommodate different tendencies. This endows SDEA to detect Byzantine attackers
  in heterogeneous federated learning. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness.'
