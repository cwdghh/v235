title: Gaussian Plane-Wave Neural Operator for Electron Density Estimation
openreview: TvoG41N1Y3
abstract: This work studies machine learning for electron density prediction, which
  is fundamental for understanding chemical systems and density functional theory
  (DFT) simulations. To this end, we introduce the Gaussian plane-wave neural operator
  (GPWNO), which operates in the infinite-dimensional functional space using the plane-wave
  and Gaussian-type orbital bases, widely recognized in the context of DFT. In particular,
  both high- and low-frequency components of the density can be effectively represented
  due to the complementary nature of the two bases. Extensive experiments on QM9,
  MD, and material project datasets demonstrate GPWNOâ€™s superior performance over
  ten baselines.
