title: Harmonizing Generalization and Personalization in Federated Prompt Learning
openreview: YYwERRXsJW
abstract: Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) incorporates large pre-trained Vision-Language
  models (VLM) into federated learning through prompt tuning. The transferable representations
  and remarkable generalization capacity of VLM make them highly compatible with the
  integration of federated learning. Addressing data heterogeneity in federated learning
  requires personalization, but excessive focus on it across clients could compromise
  the modelâ€™s ability to generalize effectively. To preserve the impressive generalization
  capability of VLM, it is crucial to strike a balance between personalization and
  generalization in FPL. To tackle this challenge, we proposed Federated Prompt Learning
  with CLIP Generalization and low-rank Personalization (FedPGP), which employs pre-trained
  CLIP to provide knowledge-guidance on the global prompt for improved generalization
  and incorporates a low-rank adaptation term to personalize the global prompt. Further,
  FedPGP integrates a prompt-wise contrastive loss to achieve knowledge guidance and
  personalized adaptation simultaneously, enabling a harmonious balance between personalization
  and generalization in FPL. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets
  to explore base-to-novel generalization in both category-level and domain-level
  scenarios with heterogeneous data, showing the superiority of FedPGP in balancing
  generalization and personalization.
