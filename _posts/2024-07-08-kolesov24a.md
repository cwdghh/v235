title: Estimating Barycenters of Distributions with Neural Optimal Transport
openreview: ymgcTqrZLT
abstract: 'Given a collection of probability measures, a practitioner sometimes needs
  to find an "average" distribution which adequately aggregates reference distributions.
  A theoretically appealing notion of such an average is the Wasserstein barycenter,
  which is the primal focus of our work. By building upon the dual formulation of
  Optimal Transport (OT), we propose a new scalable approach for solving the Wasserstein
  barycenter problem. Our methodology is based on the recent Neural OT solver: it
  has bi-level adversarial learning objective and works for general cost functions.
  These are key advantages of our method since the typical adversarial algorithms
  leveraging barycenter tasks utilize tri-level optimization and focus mostly on quadratic
  cost. We also establish theoretical error bounds for our proposed approach and showcase
  its applicability and effectiveness in illustrative scenarios and image data setups.
