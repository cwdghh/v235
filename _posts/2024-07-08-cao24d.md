title: Envisioning Outlier Exposure by Large Language Models for Out-of-Distribution
  Detection
openreview: xZO7SmM12y
abstract: 'Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential when deploying
  machine learning models in open-world scenarios. Zero-shot OOD detection, requiring
  no training on in-distribution (ID) data, has been possible with the advent of vision-language
  models like CLIP. Existing methods build a text-based classifier with only closed-set
  labels. However, this largely restricts the inherent capability of CLIP to recognize
  samples from large and open label space. In this paper, we propose to tackle this
  constraint by leveraging the expert knowledge and reasoning capability of large
  language models (LLM) to Envision potential Outlier Exposure, termed EOE, without
  access to any actual OOD data. Owing to better adaptation to open-world scenarios,
  EOE can be generalized to different tasks, including far, near, and fine-grained
  OOD detection. Technically, we design (1) LLM prompts based on visual similarity
  to generate potential outlier class labels specialized for OOD detection, as well
  as (2) a new score function based on potential outlier penalty to distinguish hard
  OOD samples effectively. Empirically, EOE achieves state-of-the-art performance
  across different OOD tasks and can be effectively scaled to the ImageNet-1K dataset.
