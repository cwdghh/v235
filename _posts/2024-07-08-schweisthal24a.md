title: Meta-Learners for Partially-Identified Treatment Effects Across Multiple Environments
openreview: s5PLISyNyP
abstract: Estimating the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) from observational
  data is relevant for many applications such as personalized medicine. Here, we focus
  on the widespread setting where the observational data come from multiple environments,
  such as different hospitals, physicians, or countries. Furthermore, we allow for
  violations of standard causal assumptions, namely, overlap within the environments
  and unconfoundedness. To this end, we move away from point identification and focus
  on partial identification. Specifically, we show that current assumptions from the
  literature on multiple environments allow us to interpret the environment as an
  instrumental variable (IV). This allows us to adapt bounds from the IV literature
  for partial identification of CATE by leveraging treatment assignment mechanisms
  across environments. Then, we propose different model-agnostic learners (so-called
  meta-learners) to estimate the bounds that can be used in combination with arbitrary
  machine learning models. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our meta-learners
  across various experiments using both simulated and real-world data. Finally, we
  discuss the applicability of our meta-learners to partial identification in instrumental
  variable settings, such as randomized controlled trials with non-compliance.
