title: Impact of Decentralized Learning on Player Utilities in Stackelberg Games
openreview: zMsMQJraEj
abstract: When deployed in the world, a learning agent such as a recommender system
  or a chatbot often repeatedly interacts with another learning agent (such as a user)
  over time. In many such two-agent systems, each agent learns separately and the
  rewards of the two agents are not perfectly aligned. To better understand such cases,
  we examine the learning dynamics of the two-agent system and the implications for
  each agentâ€™s objective. We model these systems as Stackelberg games with decentralized
  learning and show that standard regret benchmarks (such as Stackelberg equilibrium
  payoffs) result in worst-case linear regret for at least one player. To better capture
  these systems, we construct a relaxed regret benchmark that is tolerant to small
  learning errors by agents. We show that standard learning algorithms fail to provide
  sublinear regret, and we develop algorithms to achieve near-optimal $\mathcal{O}(T^{2/3})$
  regret for both players with respect to these benchmarks. We further design relaxed
  environments under which faster learning ($\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$) is possible.
  Altogether, our results take a step towards assessing how two-agent interactions
  in sequential and decentralized learning environments affect the utility of both
  agents.
