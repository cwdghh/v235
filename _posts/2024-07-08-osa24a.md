title: Discovering Multiple Solutions from a Single Task in Offline Reinforcement
  Learning
openreview: j6rG1ETRyu
abstract: Recent studies on online reinforcement learning (RL) have demonstrated the
  advantages of learning multiple behaviors from a single task, as in the case of
  few-shot adaptation to a new environment. Although this approach is expected to
  yield similar benefits in offline RL, appropriate methods for learning multiple
  solutions have not been fully investigated in previous studies. In this study, we
  therefore addressed the problem of finding multiple solutions from a single task
  in offline RL. We propose algorithms that can learn multiple solutions in offline
  RL, and empirically investigate their performance. Our experimental results show
  that the proposed algorithm learns multiple qualitatively and quantitatively distinctive
  solutions in offline RL.
