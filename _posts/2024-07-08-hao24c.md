title: 'MGit: A Model Versioning and Management System'
openreview: OjBW993g79
abstract: 'New ML models are often derived from existing ones (e.g., through fine-tuning,
  quantization or distillation), forming an ecosystem where models are <em>related</em>
  to each other and can share structure or even parameter values. Managing such a
  large and evolving ecosystem of model derivatives is challenging. For instance,
  the overhead of storing all such models is high, and models may inherit bugs from
  related models, complicating error attribution and debugging. In this paper, we
  propose a model versioning and management system called MGit that makes it easier
  to store, test, update, and collaborate on related models. MGit introduces a lineage
  graph that records the relationships between models, optimizations to efficiently
  store model parameters, and abstractions over this lineage graph that facilitate
  model testing, updating and collaboration. We find that MGit works well in practice:
  MGit is able to reduce model storage footprint by up to 7$\times$. Additionally,
  in a user study with 20 ML practitioners, users complete a model updating task 3$\times$
  faster on average with MGit.'
