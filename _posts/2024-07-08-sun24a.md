title: 'ED-Copilot: Reduce Emergency Department Wait Time with Language Model Diagnostic
  Assistance'
openreview: 0ntak1BGBd
abstract: In the emergency department (ED), patients undergo triage and multiple laboratory
  tests before diagnosis. This time-consuming process causes ED crowding which impacts
  patient mortality, medical errors, staff burnout, etc. This work proposes (time)
  <em>cost-effective diagnostic assistance</em> that leverages artificial intelligence
  systems to help ED clinicians make efficient and accurate diagnoses. In collaboration
  with ED clinicians, we use public patient data to curate MIMIC-ED-Assist, a benchmark
  for AI systems to suggest laboratory tests that minimize wait time while accurately
  predicting critical outcomes such as death. With MIMIC-ED-Assist, we develop ED-Copilot
  which sequentially suggests patient-specific laboratory tests and makes diagnostic
  predictions. ED-Copilot employs a pre-trained bio-medical language model to encode
  patient information and uses reinforcement learning to minimize ED wait time and
  maximize prediction accuracy. On MIMIC-ED-Assist, ED-Copilot improves prediction
  accuracy over baselines while halving average wait time from four hours to two hours.
  ED-Copilot can also effectively personalize treatment recommendations based on patient
  severity, further highlighting its potential as a diagnostic assistant. Since MIMIC-ED-Assist
  is a retrospective benchmark, ED-Copilot is restricted to recommend only observed
  tests. We show ED-Copilot achieves competitive performance without this restriction
  as the maximum allowed time increases. Our code is available at https://github.com/cxcscmu/ED-Copilot.
