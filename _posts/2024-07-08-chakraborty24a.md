title: 'Position: On the Possibilities of AI-Generated Text Detection'
openreview: CJbhtpcyGL
abstract: Our study addresses the challenge of distinguishing human-written text from
  Large Language Model (LLM) outputs. We provide evidence that this differentiation
  is consistently feasible, except when human and machine text distributions are indistinguishable
  across their entire support. Employing information theory, we show that while detecting
  machine-generated text becomes harder as it nears human quality, it remains possible
  with adequate text data. We introduce guidelines on the required text data quantity,
  either through sample size or sequence length, for reliable AI text detection, through
  derivations of sample complexity bounds. This research paves the way for advanced
  detection methods. Our comprehensive empirical tests, conducted across various datasets
  (Xsum, Squad, IMDb, and Kaggle FakeNews) and with several state-of-the-art text
  generators (GPT-2, GPT-3.5-Turbo, Llama, Llama-2-13B-Chat-HF, Llama-2-70B-Chat-HF),
  assess the viability of enhanced detection methods against detectors like RoBERTa-Large/Base-Detector
  and GPTZero, with increasing sample sizes and sequence lengths. Our findings align
  with OpenAIâ€™s empirical data related to sequence length, marking the first theoretical
  substantiation for these observations.
