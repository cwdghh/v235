title: 'Catapults in SGD: spikes in the training loss and their impact on generalization
  through feature learning'
openreview: jJmGl01S4l
abstract: In this paper, we first present an explanation regarding the common occurrence
  of spikes in the training loss when neural networks are trained with stochastic
  gradient descent (SGD). We provide evidence that the spikes in the training loss
  of SGD are "catapults", an optimization phenomenon originally observed in GD with
  large learning rates in Lewkowycz et al. (2020). We empirically show that these
  catapults occur in a low-dimensional subspace spanned by the top eigenvectors of
  the tangent kernel, for both GD and SGD. Second, we posit an explanation for how
  catapults lead to better generalization by demonstrating that catapults increase
  feature learning by increasing alignment with the Average Gradient Outer Product
  (AGOP) of the true predictor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a smaller batch size
  in SGD induces a larger number of catapults, thereby improving AGOP alignment and
  test performance.
