title: 'OSN: Infinite Representations of Dynamic 3D Scenes from Monocular Videos'
openreview: TTYVG17wfc
abstract: It has long been challenging to recover the underlying dynamic 3D scene
  representations from a monocular RGB video. Existing works formulate this problem
  into finding a single most plausible solution by adding various constraints such
  as depth priors and strong geometry constraints, ignoring the fact that there could
  be infinitely many 3D scene representations corresponding to a single dynamic video.
  In this paper, we aim to learn all plausible 3D scene configurations that match
  the input video, instead of just inferring a specific one. To achieve this ambitious
  goal, we introduce a new framework, called OSN. The key to our approach is a simple
  yet innovative object scale network together with a joint optimization module to
  learn an accurate scale range for every dynamic 3D object. This allows us to sample
  as many faithful 3D scene configurations as possible. Extensive experiments show
  that our method surpasses all baselines and achieves superior accuracy in dynamic
  novel view synthesis on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets. Most notably,
  our method demonstrates a clear advantage in learning fine-grained 3D scene geometry.
