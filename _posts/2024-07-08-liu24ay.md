title: Class-Imbalanced Graph Learning without Class Rebalancing
openreview: pPnkpvBeZN
abstract: Class imbalance is prevalent in real-world node classification tasks and
  poses great challenges for graph learning models. Most existing studies are rooted
  in a class-rebalancing (CR) perspective and address class imbalance with class-wise
  reweighting or resampling. In this work, we approach the root cause of class-imbalance
  bias from an topological paradigm. Specifically, we theoretically reveal two <b>fundamental
  phenomena in the graph topology</b> that greatly exacerbate the predictive bias
  stemming from class imbalance. On this basis, we devise a lightweight topological
  augmentation framework BAT to mitigate the class-imbalance bias without class rebalancing.
  Being orthogonal to CR, BAT can function as an <b>efficient plug-and-play module</b>
  that can be seamlessly combined with and significantly boost existing CR techniques.
  Systematic experiments on real-world imbalanced graph learning tasks show that BAT
  can deliver up to 46.27% performance gain and up to 72.74% bias reduction over existing
  techniques. Code, examples, and documentations are available at https://github.com/ZhiningLiu1998/BAT.
