title: 'Information Complexity of Stochastic Convex Optimization: Applications to
  Generalization, Memorization, and Tracing'
openreview: CyEJn71Z00
abstract: In this work, we investigate the interplay between memorization and learning
  in the context of <em>stochastic convex optimization</em> (SCO). We define memorization
  via the information a learning algorithm reveals about its training data points.
  We then quantify this information using the framework of conditional mutual information
  (CMI) proposed by Steinke and Zakynthinou (2020). Our main result is a precise characterization
  of the tradeoff between the accuracy of a learning algorithm and its CMI, answering
  an open question posed by Livni (2023). We show that, in the $L^2$ Lipschitzâ€“bounded
  setting and under strong convexity, every learner with an excess error $\epsilon$
  has CMI bounded below by $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ and $\Omega(1/\epsilon)$, respectively.
  We further demonstrate the essential role of memorization in learning problems in
  SCO by designing an adversary capable of accurately identifying a significant fraction
  of the training samples in specific SCO problems. Finally, we enumerate several
  implications of our results, such as a limitation of generalization bounds based
  on CMI and the incompressibility of samples in SCO problems.
