title: 'Sarah Frank-Wolfe: Methods for Constrained Optimization with Best Rates and
  Practical Features'
openreview: Zw52bJCZXc
abstract: The Frank-Wolfe (FW) method is a popular approach for solving optimization
  problems with structured constraints that arise in machine learning applications.
  In recent years, stochastic versions of FW have gained popularity, motivated by
  large datasets for which the computation of the full gradient is prohibitively expensive.
  In this paper, we present two new variants of the FW algorithms for stochastic finite-sum
  minimization. Our algorithms have the best convergence guarantees of existing stochastic
  FW approaches for both convex and non-convex objective functions. Our methods do
  not have the issue of permanently collecting large batches, which is common to many
  stochastic projection-free approaches. Moreover, our second approach does not require
  either large batches or full deterministic gradients, which is a typical weakness
  of many techniques for finite-sum problems. The faster theoretical rates of our
  approaches are confirmed experimentally.
