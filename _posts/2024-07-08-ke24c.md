title: 'DUPLEX: Dual GAT for Complex Embedding of Directed Graphs'
openreview: M3uv4qDKOL
abstract: 'Current directed graph embedding methods build upon undirected techniques
  but often inadequately capture directed edge information, leading to challenges
  such as: (1) Suboptimal representations for nodes with low in/out-degrees, due to
  the insufficient neighbor interactions; (2) Limited inductive ability for representing
  new nodes post-training; (3) Narrow generalizability, as training is overly coupled
  with specific tasks. In response, we propose DUPLEX, an inductive framework for
  complex embeddings of directed graphs. It (1) leverages Hermitian adjacency matrix
  decomposition for comprehensive neighbor integration, (2) employs a dual GAT encoder
  for directional neighbor modeling, and (3) features two parameter-free decoders
  to decouple training from particular tasks. DUPLEX outperforms state-of-the-art
  models, especially for nodes with sparse connectivity, and demonstrates robust inductive
  capability and adaptability across various tasks. The code will be available upon
  publication.'
