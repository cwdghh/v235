title: Theoretical Analysis of Learned Database Operations under Distribution Shift
  through Distribution Learnability
openreview: oowQ8LPA12
abstract: Use of machine learning to perform database operations, such as indexing,
  cardinality estimation, and sorting, is shown to provide substantial performance
  benefits. However, when datasets change and data distribution shifts, empirical
  results also show performance degradation for learned models, possibly to worse
  than non-learned alternatives. This, together with a lack of theoretical understanding
  of learned methods undermines their practical applicability, since there are no
  guarantees on how well the models will perform after deployment. In this paper,
  we present the first known theoretical characterization of the performance of learned
  models in dynamic datasets, for the aforementioned operations. Our results show
  novel theoretical characteristics achievable by learned models and provide bounds
  on the performance of the models that characterize their advantages over non-learned
  methods, showing why and when learned models can outperform the alternatives. Our
  analysis develops the <em>distribution learnability</em> framework and novel theoretical
  tools which build the foundation for the analysis of learned database operations
  in the future.
