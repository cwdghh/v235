title: Zero-Shot Unsupervised and Text-Based Audio Editing Using DDPM Inversion
openreview: mCzyRdDak5
abstract: Editing signals using large pre-trained models, in a zero-shot manner, has
  recently seen rapid advancements in the image domain. However, this wave has yet
  to reach the audio domain. In this paper, we explore two zero-shot editing techniques
  for audio signals, which use DDPM inversion with pre-trained diffusion models. The
  first, which we coin <em>ZEro-shot Text-based Audio (ZETA)</em> editing, is adopted
  from the image domain. The second, named <em>ZEro-shot UnSupervized (ZEUS)</em>
  editing, is a novel approach for discovering semantically meaningful editing directions
  without supervision. When applied to music signals, this method exposes a range
  of musically interesting modifications, from controlling the participation of specific
  instruments to improvisations on the melody. Samples and code can be found on our
  examples page.
