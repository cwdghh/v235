title: Pre-Training Protein Bi-level Representation Through Span Mask Strategy On
  3D Protein Chains
openreview: qY63FnLuJ1
abstract: In recent years, there has been a surge in the development of 3D structure-based
  pre-trained protein models, representing a significant advancement over pre-trained
  protein language models in various downstream tasks. However, most existing structure-based
  pre-trained models primarily focus on the residue level, i.e., alpha carbon atoms,
  while ignoring other atoms like side chain atoms. We argue that modeling proteins
  at both residue and atom levels is important since the side chain atoms can also
  be crucial for numerous downstream tasks, for example, molecular docking. Nevertheless,
  we find that naively combining residue and atom information during pre-training
  typically fails. We identify a key reason is the information leakage caused by the
  inclusion of atom structure in the input, which renders residue-level pre-training
  tasks trivial and results in insufficiently expressive residue representations.
  To address this issue, we introduce a span mask pre-training strategy on 3D protein
  chains to learn meaningful representations of both residues and atoms. This leads
  to a simple yet effective approach to learning protein representation suitable for
  diverse downstream tasks. Extensive experimental results on binding site prediction
  and function prediction tasks demonstrate our proposed pre-training approach significantly
  outperforms other methods. Our code will be made public.
