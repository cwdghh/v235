title: Online Resource Allocation with Non-Stationary Customers
openreview: RsIMGYzBcv
abstract: 'We propose a novel algorithm for online resource allocation with non-stationary
  customer arrivals and unknown click-through rates. We assume multiple types of customers
  arriving in a nonstationary stochastic fashion, with unknown arrival rates in each
  period. Additionally, customers’ click-through rates are assumed to be unknown and
  only learnable online. By leveraging results from the stochastic contextual bandit
  with knapsack and online matching with adversarial arrivals, we develop an online
  scheme to allocate the resources to nonstationary customers. We prove that under
  mild conditions, our scheme achieves a “best-of-both-world” result: the scheme has
  a sublinear regret when the customer arrivals are near-stationary, and enjoys an
  optimal competitive ratio under general (non-stationary) customer arrival distributions.
  Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to show our approach generates
  near-optimal revenues for all different customer scenarios.'
