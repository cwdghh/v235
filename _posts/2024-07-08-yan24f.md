title: Handling Heterogeneous Curvatures in Bandit LQR Control
openreview: zWIS8I9G9B
abstract: We investigate online Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with bandit feedback
  and semi-adversarial disturbances. Previous works assume costs with <em>homogeneous</em>
  curvatures (i.e., with a uniform strong convexity lower bound), which can be hard
  to satisfy in many real scenarios and prohibits adapting to true curvatures for
  better performance. In this paper, we initiate the study of bandit LQR control with
  <em>heterogeneous</em> cost curvatures, aiming to strengthen the algorithm’s adaptivity.
  To achieve this, we reduce the problem to bandit convex optimization with memory
  via a “with-history” reduction to avoid hard-to-control truncation errors. Then
  we provide a novel analysis for an important <em>stability</em> term that appeared
  in both regret and memory, using <em>Newton decrement</em> developed in interior-point
  methods. The analysis enables us to guarantee memory-related terms introduced in
  the reduction and also provide a simplified analysis for handling heterogeneous
  curvatures in bandit convex optimization. Finally, we achieve interpolated guarantees
  that can not only recover existing bounds for convex and quadratic costs but also
  attain new implications for cases of corrupted and decaying quadraticity.
