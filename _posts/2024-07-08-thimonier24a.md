title: Beyond Individual Input for Deep Anomaly Detection on Tabular Data
openreview: chDpBp2P6b
abstract: Anomaly detection is vital in many domains, such as finance, healthcare,
  and cybersecurity. In this paper, we propose a novel deep anomaly detection method
  for tabular data that leverages Non-Parametric Transformers (NPTs), a model initially
  proposed for supervised tasks, to capture both feature-feature and sample-sample
  dependencies. In a reconstruction-based framework, we train an NPT to reconstruct
  masked features of normal samples. In a non-parametric fashion, we leverage the
  whole training set during inference and use the model’s ability to reconstruct the
  masked features to generate an anomaly score. To the best of our knowledge, this
  is the first work to successfully combine feature-feature and sample-sample dependencies
  for anomaly detection on tabular datasets. Through extensive experiments on 31 benchmark
  tabular datasets, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
  outperforming existing methods by 2.4% and 1.2% in terms of F1-score and AUROC,
  respectively. Our ablation study further proves that modeling both types of dependencies
  is crucial for anomaly detection on tabular data.
