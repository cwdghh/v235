title: 'KISA: A Unified Keyframe Identifier and Skill Annotator for Long-Horizon Robotics
  Demonstrations'
openreview: oCI9gHocws
abstract: Robotic manipulation tasks often span over long horizons and encapsulate
  multiple subtasks with different skills. Learning policies directly from long-horizon
  demonstrations is challenging without intermediate keyframes guidance and corresponding
  skill annotations. Existing approaches for keyframe identification often struggle
  to offer reliable decomposition for low accuracy and fail to provide semantic relevance
  between keyframes and skills. For this, we propose a unified <b>K</b>eyframe <b>I</b>dentifier
  and <b>S</b>kill <b>A</b>notator (<b>KISA</b>) that utilizes pretrained visual-language
  representations for precise and interpretable decomposition of unlabeled demonstrations.
  Specifically, we develop a simple yet effective temporal enhancement module that
  enriches frame-level representations with expanded receptive fields to capture semantic
  dynamics at the video level. We further propose coarse contrastive learning and
  fine-grained monotonic encouragement to enhance the alignment between visual representations
  from keyframes and language representations from skills. The experimental results
  across three benchmarks demonstrate that KISA outperforms competitive baselines
  in terms of accuracy and interpretability of keyframe identification. Moreover,
  KISA exhibits robust generalization capabilities and the flexibility to incorporate
  various pretrained representations.
