title: A Differentiable Partially Observable Generalized Linear Model with Forward-Backward
  Message Passing
openreview: 2FKzbEE24s
abstract: 'The partially observable generalized linear model (POGLM) is a powerful
  tool for understanding neural connectivities under the assumption of existing hidden
  neurons. With spike trains only recorded from visible neurons, existing works use
  variational inference to learn POGLM meanwhile presenting the difficulty of learning
  this latent variable model. There are two main issues: (1) the sampled Poisson hidden
  spike count hinders the use of the pathwise gradient estimator in VI; and (2) the
  existing design of the variational model is neither expressive nor time-efficient,
  which further affects the performance. For (1), we propose a new differentiable
  POGLM, which enables the pathwise gradient estimator, better than the score function
  gradient estimator used in existing works. For (2), we propose the forward-backward
  message-passing sampling scheme for the variational model. Comprehensive experiments
  show that our differentiable POGLMs with our forward-backward message passing produce
  a better performance on one synthetic and two real-world datasets. Furthermore,
  our new method yields more interpretable parameters, underscoring its significance
  in neuroscience.'
