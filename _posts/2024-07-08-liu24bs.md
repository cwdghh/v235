title: 'Evolution of Heuristics: Towards Efficient Automatic Algorithm Design Using
  Large Language Model'
openreview: BwAkaxqiLB
abstract: Heuristics are widely used for dealing with complex search and optimization
  problems. However, manual design of heuristics can be often very labour extensive
  and requires rich working experience and knowledge. This paper proposes Evolution
  of Heuristic (EoH), a novel evolutionary paradigm that leverages both Large Language
  Models (LLMs) and Evolutionary Computation (EC) methods for Automatic Heuristic
  Design (AHD). EoH represents the ideas of heuristics in natural language, termed
  thoughts. They are then translated into executable codes by LLMs. The evolution
  of both thoughts and codes in an evolutionary search framework makes it very effective
  and efficient for generating high-performance heuristics. Experiments on three widely
  studied combinatorial optimization benchmark problems demonstrate that EoH outperforms
  commonly used handcrafted heuristics and other recent AHD methods including FunSearch.
  Particularly, the heuristic produced by EoH with a low computational budget (in
  terms of the number of queries to LLMs) significantly outperforms widely-used human
  hand-crafted baseline algorithms for the online bin packing problem.
