title: Unsupervised Parameter-free Simplicial Representation Learning with Scattering
  Transforms
openreview: wmljUnbjy6
abstract: Simplicial neural network models are becoming popular for processing and
  analyzing higher-order graph data, but they suffer from high training complexity
  and dependence on task-specific labels. To address these challenges, we propose
  simplicial scattering networks (SSNs), a parameter-free model inspired by scattering
  transforms designed to extract task-agnostic features from simplicial complex data
  without labels in a principled manner. Specifically, we propose a simplicial scattering
  transform based on random walk matrices for various adjacencies underlying a simplicial
  complex. We then use the simplicial scattering transform to construct a deep filter
  bank network that captures high-frequency information at multiple scales. The proposed
  simplicial scattering transform possesses properties such as permutation invariance,
  robustness to perturbations, and expressivity. We theoretically prove that including
  higher-order information improves the robustness of SSNs to perturbations. Empirical
  evaluations demonstrate that SSNs outperform existing simplicial or graph neural
  models in many tasks like node classification, simplicial closure, graph classification,
  trajectory prediction, and simplex prediction while being computationally efficient.
