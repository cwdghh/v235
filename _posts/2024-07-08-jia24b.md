title: 'GeminiFusion: Efficient Pixel-wise Multimodal Fusion for Vision Transformer'
openreview: Zsz9Pdfvtg
abstract: Cross-modal transformers have demonstrated superiority in various vision
  tasks by effectively integrating different modalities. This paper first critiques
  prior token exchange methods which replace less informative tokens with inter-modal
  features, and demonstrate exchange based methods underperform cross-attention mechanisms,
  while the computational demand of the latter inevitably restricts its use with longer
  sequences. To surmount the computational challenges, we propose <em>GeminiFusion</em>,
  a pixel-wise fusion approach that capitalizes on aligned cross-modal representations.
  <em>GeminiFusion</em> elegantly combines intra-modal and inter-modal attentions,
  dynamically integrating complementary information across modalities. We employ a
  layer-adaptive noise to adaptively control their interplay on a per-layer basis,
  thereby achieving a harmonized fusion process. Notably, <em>GeminiFusion</em> maintains
  linear complexity with respect to the number of input tokens, ensuring this multimodal
  framework operates with efficiency comparable to unimodal networks. Comprehensive
  evaluations across multimodal image-to-image translation, $3$D object detection
  and arbitrary-modal semantic segmentation tasks, including RGB, depth, LiDAR, event
  data, etc. demonstrate the superior performance of our <em>GeminiFusion</em> against
  leading-edge techniques. The PyTorch code is available here.
