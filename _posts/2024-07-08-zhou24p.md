title: 'GALA3D: Towards Text-to-3D Complex Scene Generation via Layout-guided Generative
  Gaussian Splatting'
openreview: zL9q2JD1dC
abstract: We present GALA3D, generative 3D GAussians with LAyout-guided control, for
  effective compositional text-to-3D generation. We first utilize large language models
  (LLMs) to generate the initial layout and introduce a layout-guided 3D Gaussian
  representation for 3D content generation with adaptive geometric constraints. We
  then propose an instance-scene compositional optimization mechanism with conditioned
  diffusion to collaboratively generate realistic 3D scenes with consistent geometry,
  texture, scale, and accurate interactions among multiple objects while simultaneously
  adjusting the coarse layout priors extracted from the LLMs to align with the generated
  scene. Experiments show that GALA3D is a user-friendly, end-to-end framework for
  state-of-the-art scene-level 3D content generation and controllable editing while
  ensuring the high fidelity of object-level entities within the scene. The source
  codes and models will be available at gala3d.github.io.
