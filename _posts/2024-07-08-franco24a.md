title: Hyperbolic Active Learning for Semantic Segmentation under Domain Shift
openreview: hKdJPMQvew
abstract: We introduce a hyperbolic neural network approach to pixel-level active
  learning for semantic segmentation. Analysis of the data statistics leads to a novel
  interpretation of the hyperbolic radius as an indicator of data scarcity. In HALO
  (Hyperbolic Active Learning Optimization), for the first time, we propose the use
  of epistemic uncertainty as a data acquisition strategy, following the intuition
  of selecting data points that are the least known. The hyperbolic radius, complemented
  by the widely-adopted prediction entropy, effectively approximates epistemic uncertainty.
  We perform extensive experimental analysis based on two established synthetic-to-real
  benchmarks, i.e. GTAV $\rightarrow$ Cityscapes and SYNTHIA $\rightarrow$ Cityscapes.
  Additionally, we test HALO on Cityscape $\rightarrow$ ACDC for domain adaptation
  under adverse weather conditions, and we benchmark both convolutional and attention-based
  backbones. HALO sets a new state-of-the-art in active learning for semantic segmentation
  under domain shift and it is the first active learning approach that surpasses the
  performance of supervised domain adaptation while using only a small portion of
  labels (i.e., 1%).
