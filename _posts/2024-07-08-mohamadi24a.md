title: Why Do You Grok? A Theoretical Analysis on Grokking Modular Addition
openreview: ad5I6No9G1
abstract: We present a theoretical explanation of the “grokking” phenomenon (Power
  et al., 2022), where a model generalizes long after overfitting, for the originally-studied
  problem of modular addition. First, we show that early in gradient descent, so that
  the “kernel regime” approximately holds, no permutation-equivariant model can achieve
  small population error on modular addition unless it sees at least a constant fraction
  of all possible data points. Eventually, however, models escape the kernel regime.
  We show that one-hidden-layer quadratic networks that achieve zero training loss
  with bounded $\ell_\infty$ norm generalize well with substantially fewer training
  points, and further show such networks exist and can be found by gradient descent
  with small $\ell_\infty$ regularization. We further provide empirical evidence that
  these networks leave the kernel regime only after initially overfitting. Taken together,
  our results strongly support the case for grokking as a consequence of the transition
  from kernel-like behavior to limiting behavior of gradient descent on deep networks.
