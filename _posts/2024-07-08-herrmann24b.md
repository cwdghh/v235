title: 'Position: Why We Must Rethink Empirical Research in Machine Learning'
openreview: DprrMz24tk
abstract: We warn against a common but incomplete understanding of empirical research
  in machine learning that leads to non-replicable results, makes findings unreliable,
  and threatens to undermine progress in the field. To overcome this alarming situation,
  we call for more awareness of the plurality of ways of gaining knowledge experimentally
  but also of some epistemic limitations. In particular, we argue most current empirical
  machine learning research is fashioned as confirmatory research while it should
  rather be considered exploratory.
