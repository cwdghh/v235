title: 'Position: On the Societal Impact of Open Foundation Models'
openreview: jRX6yCxFhx
abstract: 'Foundation models are powerful technologies: how they are released publicly
  directly shapes their societal impact. In this position paper, we focus on <em>open</em>
  foundation models, defined here as those with broadly available model weights (e.g.,
  Llama 3, Stable Diffusion XL). We identify five distinctive properties (e.g., greater
  customizability, poor monitoring) that mediate their benefits and risks. Open foundation
  models present significant benefits, with some caveats, that span innovation, competition,
  the distribution of decision-making power, and transparency. To understand their
  risks of misuse, we design a risk assessment framework for analyzing their <em>marginal
  risk</em>. Across several misuse vectors (e.g., cyberattacks, bioweapons), we find
  that current research is insufficient to effectively characterize the marginal risk
  of open foundation models relative to pre-existing technologies. The framework helps
  explain why the marginal risk is low in some cases, clarifies disagreements about
  misuse risks by revealing that past work has focused on different subsets of the
  framework with different assumptions, and articulates a way forward for more constructive
  debate. Overall, our work helps support a more grounded assessment of the societal
  impact of open foundation models by outlining what research is needed to empirically
  validate their theoretical benefits and risks.'
