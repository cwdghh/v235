title: From Inverse Optimization to Feasibility to ERM
openreview: GJzqRKOdRi
abstract: Inverse optimization involves inferring unknown parameters of an optimization
  problem from known solutions and is widely used in fields such as transportation,
  power systems, and healthcare. We study the <em>contextual inverse optimization
  setting</em> that utilizes additional contextual information to better predict the
  unknown problem parameters. We focus on contextual inverse linear programming (CILP)
  addressing the challenges posed by the non-differentiable nature of LPs. For a linear
  prediction model, we reduce CILP to a convex feasibility problem allowing the use
  of standard algorithms such as alternating projections. The resulting algorithm
  for CILP is equipped with theoretical convergence guarantees without additional
  assumptions such as degeneracy or interpolation. Next, we reduce CILP to empirical
  risk minimization (ERM) on a smooth, convex loss that satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz
  condition. This reduction enables the use of scalable first-order optimization methods
  to solve large non-convex problems while maintaining theoretical guarantees in the
  convex setting. Subsequently, we use the reduction to ERM to quantify the generalization
  performance of the proposed algorithm on previously unseen instances. Finally, we
  experimentally validate our approach on synthetic and real-world problems and demonstrate
  improved performance compared to existing methods.
