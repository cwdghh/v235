title: Online Algorithms with Uncertainty-Quantified Predictions
openreview: xF656w37Mj
abstract: The burgeoning field of algorithms with predictions studies the problem
  of using possibly imperfect machine learning predictions to improve online algorithm
  performance. While nearly all existing algorithms in this framework make no assumptions
  on prediction quality, a number of methods providing uncertainty quantification
  (UQ) on machine learning models have been developed in recent years, which could
  enable additional information about prediction quality at decision time. In this
  work, we investigate the problem of optimally utilizing uncertainty-quantified predictions
  in the design of online algorithms. In particular, we study two classic online problems,
  ski rental and online search, where the decision-maker is provided predictions augmented
  with UQ describing the likelihood of the ground truth falling within a particular
  range of values. We demonstrate that non-trivial modifications to algorithm design
  are needed to fully leverage the UQ predictions. Moreover, we consider how to utilize
  more general forms of UQ, proposing an online learning framework that learns to
  exploit UQ to make decisions in multi-instance settings.
