title: Convergence and Complexity Guarantee for Inexact First-order Riemannian Optimization
  Algorithms
openreview: 7KtFQnF368
abstract: We analyze inexact Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) where Riemannian gradients
  and retractions are inexactly (and cheaply) computed. Our focus is on understanding
  when inexact RGD converges and what is the complexity in the general nonconvex and
  constrained setting. We answer these questions in a general framework of tangential
  Block Majorization-Minimization (tBMM). We establish that tBMM converges to an $\epsilon$-stationary
  point within $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations. Under a mild assumption, the results
  still hold when the subproblem is solved inexactly in each iteration provided the
  total optimality gap is bounded. Our general analysis applies to a wide range of
  classical algorithms with Riemannian constraints including inexact RGD and proximal
  gradient method on Stiefel manifolds. We numerically validate that tBMM shows improved
  performance over existing methods when applied to various problems, including nonnegative
  tensor decomposition with Riemannian constraints, regularized nonnegative matrix
  factorization, and low-rank matrix recovery problems.
