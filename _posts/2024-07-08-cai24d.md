title: 'Batch and match: black-box variational inference with a score-based divergence'
openreview: bplNmU2ROC
abstract: Most leading implementations of black-box variational inference (BBVI) are
  based on optimizing a stochastic evidence lower bound (ELBO). But such approaches
  to BBVI often converge slowly due to the high variance of their gradient estimates
  and their sensitivity to hyperparameters. In this work, we propose <em>batch and
  match</em> (BaM), an alternative approach to BBVI based on a score-based divergence.
  Notably, this score-based divergence can be optimized by a closed-form proximal
  update for Gaussian variational families with full covariance matrices. We analyze
  the convergence of BaM when the target distribution is Gaussian, and we prove that
  in the limit of infinite batch size the variational parameter updates converge exponentially
  quickly to the target mean and covariance. We also evaluate the performance of BaM
  on Gaussian and non-Gaussian target distributions that arise from posterior inference
  in hierarchical and deep generative models. In these experiments, we find that BaM
  typically converges in fewer (and sometimes significantly fewer) gradient evaluations
  than leading implementations of BBVI based on ELBO maximization.
