title: 'PlanDQ: Hierarchical Plan Orchestration via D-Conductor and Q-Performer'
openreview: 17ZwoHl65h
abstract: Despite the recent advancements in offline RL, no unified algorithm could
  achieve superior performance across a broad range of tasks. Offline <em>value function
  learning</em>, in particular, struggles with sparse-reward, long-horizon tasks due
  to the difficulty of solving credit assignment and extrapolation errors that accumulates
  as the horizon of the task grows. On the other hand, models that can perform well
  in long-horizon tasks are designed specifically for goal-conditioned tasks, which
  commonly perform worse than value function learning methods on short-horizon, dense-reward
  scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose a hierarchical planner designed for offline
  RL called PlanDQ. PlanDQ incorporates a diffusion-based planner at the high level,
  named D-Conductor, which guides the low-level policy through sub-goals. At the low
  level, we used a Q-learning based approach called the Q-Performer to accomplish
  these sub-goals. Our experimental results suggest that PlanDQ can achieve superior
  or competitive performance on D4RL continuous control benchmark tasks as well as
  AntMaze, Kitchen, and Calvin as long-horizon tasks.
