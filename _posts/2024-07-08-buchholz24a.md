title: Robustness of Nonlinear Representation Learning
openreview: GyV33H5Uuk
abstract: We study the problem of unsupervised representation learning in slightly
  misspecified settings, and thus formalize the study of robustness of nonlinear representation
  learning. We focus on the case where the mixing is close to a local isometry in
  a suitable distance and show based on existing rigidity results that the mixing
  can be identified up to linear transformations and small errors. In a second step,
  we investigate Independent Component Analysis (ICA) with observations generated
  according to $x=f(s)=As+h(s)$ where $A$ is an invertible mixing matrix and $h$ a
  small perturbation. We show that we can approximately recover the matrix $A$ and
  the independent components. Together, these two results show approximate identifiability
  of nonlinear ICA with almost isometric mixing functions. Those results are a step
  towards identifiability results for unsupervised representation learning for real-world
  data that do not follow restrictive model classes.
