title: 'Sampling is as easy as keeping the consistency: convergence guarantee for
  Consistency Models'
openreview: ZPiEIhQpos
abstract: We provide the first convergence guarantee for the Consistency Models (CMs),
  a newly emerging type of one-step generative models that is capable of generating
  comparable samples to those sampled from state-of-the-art Diffusion Models. Our
  main result is that, under the basic assumptions on score-matching errors, consistency
  errors, and smoothness of the data distribution, CMs can efficiently generate samples
  in one step with small $W_2$ error to any real data distribution. Our results (1)
  hold for $L^2$-accurate assumptions on both score and consistency functions (rather
  than $L^\infty$-accurate assumptions); (2) do not require strong assumptions on
  the data distribution such as log-Sobelev conditions; (3) scale polynomially in
  all parameters; and (4) match the state-of-the-art convergence guarantee for score-based
  generative models. We also show that the Multi-step Consistency Sampling procedure
  can further reduce the error comparing to one step sampling, which supports the
  original statement from Song Yangâ€™s work. Our result can be generalized to arbitrary
  bounded data distributions that may be supported on some low-dimensional sub-manifolds.
  Our results further imply TV error guarantees when making some Langevin-based modifications
  to the output distributions.
