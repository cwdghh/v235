title: Combinatorial Multivariant Multi-Armed Bandits with Applications to Episodic
  Reinforcement Learning and Beyond
openreview: pAdI75JG3G
abstract: We introduce a novel framework of combinatorial multi-armed bandits (CMAB)
  with multivariant and probabilistically triggering arms (CMAB-MT), where the outcome
  of each arm is a $d$-dimensional multivariant random variable and the feedback follows
  a general arm triggering process. Compared with existing CMAB works, CMAB-MT not
  only enhances the modeling power but also allows improved results by leveraging
  distinct statistical properties for multivariant random variables. For CMAB-MT,
  we propose a general 1-norm multivariant and triggering probability-modulated smoothness
  condition, and an optimistic CUCB-MT algorithm built upon this condition. Our framework
  can include many important problems as applications, such as episodic reinforcement
  learning (RL) and probabilistic maximum coverage for goods distribution, all of
  which meet the above smoothness condition and achieve matching or improved regret
  bounds compared to existing works. Through our new framework, we build the first
  connection between the episodic RL and CMAB literature, by offering a new angle
  to solve the episodic RL through the lens of CMAB, which may encourage more interactions
  between these two important directions.
