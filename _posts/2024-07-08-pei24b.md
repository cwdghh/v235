title: Exploiting Code Symmetries for Learning Program Semantics
openreview: OLvgrLtv6J
abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of teaching code semantics to Large Language
  Models (LLMs) for program analysis by incorporating code symmetries into the model
  architecture. We introduce a group-theoretic framework that defines code symmetries
  as semantics-preserving transformations, where forming a code symmetry group enables
  precise and efficient reasoning of code semantics. Our solution, SymC, develops
  a novel variant of self-attention that is provably equivariant to code symmetries
  from the permutation group defined over the program dependence graph. SymC obtains
  superior performance on five program analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art
  code models, including GPT-4, without any pre-training. Our results suggest that
  code LLMs that encode the code structural prior via the code symmetry group generalize
  better and faster.
