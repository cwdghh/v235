title: 'video-SALMONN: Speech-Enhanced Audio-Visual Large Language Models'
openreview: nYsh5GFIqX
abstract: Speech understanding as an element of the more generic video understanding
  using audio-visual large language models (av-LLMs) is a crucial yet understudied
  aspect. This paper proposes video-SALMONN, a single end-to-end av-LLM for video
  processing, which can understand not only visual frame sequences, audio events and
  music, but speech as well. To obtain fine-grained temporal information required
  by speech understanding, while keeping efficient for other video elements, this
  paper proposes a novel multi-resolution causal Q-Former (MRC Q-Former) structure
  to connect pre-trained audio-visual encoders and the backbone large language model.
  Moreover, dedicated training approaches including the diversity loss and the unpaired
  audio-visual mixed training scheme are proposed to avoid frames or modality dominance.
  On the introduced audio-visual evaluation benchmark, video-SALMONN achieves more
  than 25% absolute accuracy improvements on the video-QA task and over 30% absolute
  accuracy improvements on audio-visual QA tasks with human speech. In addition, video-SALMONN
  demonstrates remarkable video comprehension and reasoning abilities on tasks that
  are unprecedented by other av-LLMs. Our training code and model checkpoints are
