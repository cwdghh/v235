title: 'Caduceus: Bi-Directional Equivariant Long-Range DNA Sequence Modeling'
openreview: mk3A5IUdn8
abstract: 'Large-scale sequence modeling has sparked rapid advances that now extend
  into biology and genomics. However, modeling genomic sequences introduces challenges
  such as the need to model long-range token interactions, the effects of upstream
  and downstream regions of the genome, and the reverse complementarity (RC) of DNA.
  Here, we propose an architecture motivated by these challenges that builds off the
  long-range Mamba block, and extends it to a BiMamba component that supports bi-directionality,
  and to a MambaDNA block that additionally supports RC equivariance. We use MambaDNA
  as the basis of Caduceus, the first family of RC equivariant bi-directional long-range
  DNA language models, and we introduce pre-training and fine-tuning strategies that
  yield Caduceus DNA foundation models. Caduceus outperforms previous long-range models
  on downstream benchmarks; on a challenging long-range variant effect prediction
  task, Caduceus exceeds the performance of 10x larger models that do not leverage
  bi-directionality or equivariance. Code to reproduce our experiments is available
  here: https://github.com/kuleshov-group/caduceus.'
