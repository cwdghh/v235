title: 'Expressivity and Generalization: Fragment-Biases for Molecular GNNs'
openreview: rPm5cKb1VB
abstract: Although recent advances in higher-order Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) improve
  the theoretical expressiveness and molecular property predictive performance, they
  often fall short of the empirical performance of models that explicitly use fragment
  information as inductive bias. However, for these approaches, there exists no theoretic
  expressivity study. In this work, we propose the <em>Fragment-WL</em> test, an extension
  to the well-known Weisfeiler & Leman (WL) test, which enables the theoretic analysis
  of these fragment-biased GNNs. Building on the insights gained from the Fragment-WL
  test, we develop a new GNN architecture and a fragmentation with infinite vocabulary
  that significantly boosts expressiveness. We show the effectiveness of our model
  on synthetic and real-world data where we outperform all GNNs on Peptides and have
  $12$% lower error than all GNNs on ZINC and $34$% lower error than other fragment-biased
  models. Furthermore, we show that our model exhibits superior generalization capabilities
  compared to the latest transformer-based architectures, positioning it as a robust
  solution for a range of molecular modeling tasks.
