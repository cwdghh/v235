title: Learning to Explore in POMDPs with Informational Rewards
openreview: oTD3WoQyFR
abstract: 'Standard exploration methods typically rely on random coverage of the state
  space or coverage-promoting exploration bonuses. However, in partially observed
  settings, the biggest exploration challenge is often posed by the need to discover
  information-gathering strategiesâ€”e.g., an agent that has to navigate to a location
  in traffic might learn to first check traffic conditions and then choose a route.
  In this work, we design a POMDP agent that gathers information about the hidden
  state, using ideas from the meta-exploration literature. Our approach provides an
  exploration bonus that rewards the agent for gathering information about the state
  that is relevant for completing the task. While this requires the agent to know
  what this information is during training, it can obtained in several ways: in the
  most general case, off-policy algorithms can leverage knowledge about the entire
  trajectory to determine such information in hindsight, but the user can also provide
  prior knowledge (e.g., privileged information) to help inform the training process.
  Through experiments in several partially-observed environments, we find that our
  approach is competitive with prior methods when minimal exploration is needed, but
  substantially outperforms them when more complex strategies are required. Our algorithm
  also shows the ability to learn without any privileged information, by reasoning
  about the entire trajectory in hindsight and and effectively using any information
  it reveals about the hidden state.'
