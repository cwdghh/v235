title: Posterior Sampling-Based Bayesian Optimization with Tighter Bayesian Regret
  Bounds
openreview: DKOHE4n8jk
abstract: Among various acquisition functions (AFs) in Bayesian optimization (BO),
  Gaussian process upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) and Thompson sampling (TS) are
  well-known options with established theoretical properties regarding Bayesian cumulative
  regret (BCR). Recently, it has been shown that a randomized variant of GP-UCB achieves
  a tighter BCR bound compared with GP-UCB, which we call the tighter BCR bound for
  brevity. Inspired by this study, this paper first shows that TS achieves the tighter
  BCR bound. On the other hand, GP-UCB and TS often practically suffer from manual
  hyperparameter tuning and over-exploration issues, respectively. Therefore, we analyze
  yet another AF called a probability of improvement from the maximum of a sample
  path (PIMS). We show that PIMS achieves the tighter BCR bound and avoids the hyperparameter
  tuning, unlike GP-UCB. Furthermore, we demonstrate a wide range of experiments,
  focusing on the effectiveness of PIMS that mitigates the practical issues of GP-UCB
  and TS.
