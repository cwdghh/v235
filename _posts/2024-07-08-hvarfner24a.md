title: Vanilla Bayesian Optimization Performs Great in High Dimensions
openreview: OfT8MgIqHT
abstract: High-dimensional optimization problems have long been considered the Achillesâ€™
  heel of Bayesian optimization algorithms. Spurred by the curse of dimensionality,
  a large collection of algorithms aim to make BO more performant in this setting,
  commonly by imposing various simplifying assumptions on the objective, thereby decreasing
  its presumed complexity. In this paper, we identify the degeneracies that make vanilla
  BO poorly suited to high-dimensional tasks, and further show how existing algorithms
  address these degeneracies through the lens of model complexity. Motivated by the
  model complexity measure, we derive an enhancement to the prior assumptions that
  are typical of the vanilla BO algorithm, which reduces the complexity to manageable
  levels without imposing structural restrictions on the objective. Our modification
  - a simple scaling of the Gaussian process lengthscale prior in the dimensionality
  - reveals that standard BO works drastically better than previously thought in high
  dimensions. Our insights are supplemented by substantial out-performance of existing
  state-of-the-art on multiple commonly considered real-world high-dimensional tasks.
