title: Indirectly Parameterized Concrete Autoencoders
openreview: GqsRKEhelH
abstract: 'Feature selection is a crucial task in settings where data is high-dimensional
  or acquiring the full set of features is costly. Recent developments in neural network-based
  embedded feature selection show promising results across a wide range of applications.
  Concrete Autoencoders (CAEs), considered state-of-the-art in embedded feature selection,
  may struggle to achieve stable joint optimization, hurting their training time and
  generalization. In this work, we identify that this instability is correlated with
  the CAE learning duplicate selections. To remedy this, we propose a simple and effective
  improvement: Indirectly Parameterized CAEs (IP-CAEs). IP-CAEs learn an embedding
  and a mapping from it to the Gumbel-Softmax distributionsâ€™ parameters. Despite being
  simple to implement, IP-CAE exhibits significant and consistent improvements over
  CAE in both generalization and training time across several datasets for reconstruction
  and classification. Unlike CAE, IP-CAE effectively leverages non-linear relationships
  and does not require retraining the jointly optimized decoder. Furthermore, our
  approach is, in principle, generalizable to Gumbel-Softmax distributions beyond
  feature selection.'
