title: Probabilistic Constrained Reinforcement Learning with Formal Interpretability
openreview: Zo9zXdVhW2
abstract: 'Reinforcement learning can provide effective reasoning for sequential decision-making
  problems with variable dynamics. Such reasoning in practical implementation, however,
  poses a persistent challenge in interpreting the reward function and the corresponding
  optimal policy. Consequently, representing sequential decision-making problems as
  probabilistic inference can have considerable value, as, in principle, the inference
  offers diverse and powerful mathematical tools to infer the stochastic dynamics
  whilst suggesting a probabilistic interpretation of policy optimization. In this
  study, we propose a novel Adaptive Wasserstein Variational Optimization, namely
  AWaVO, to tackle these interpretability challenges. Our approach uses formal methods
  to achieve the interpretability: convergence guarantee, training transparency, and
  intrinsic decision-interpretation. To demonstrate its practicality, we showcase
  guaranteed interpretability including a global convergence rate $\Theta(1/\sqrt{T})$
  not only in simulation but also in real-world quadrotor tasks. In comparison with
  state-of-the-art benchmarks, including TRPO-IPO, PCPO, and CRPO, we empirically
  verify that AWaVO offers a reasonable trade-off between high performance and sufficient
  interpretability.'
