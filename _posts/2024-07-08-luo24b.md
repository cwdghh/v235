title: 'PGODE: Towards High-quality System Dynamics Modeling'
openreview: jrE7geZekq
abstract: This paper studies the problem of modeling multi-agent dynamical systems,
  where agents could interact mutually to influence their behaviors. Recent research
  predominantly uses geometric graphs to depict these mutual interactions, which are
  then captured by powerful graph neural networks (GNNs). However, predicting interacting
  dynamics in challenging scenarios such as out-of-distribution shift and complicated
  underlying rules remains unsolved. In this paper, we propose a new approach named
  Prototypical Graph ODE (PGODE) to address the problem. The core of PGODE is to incorporate
  prototype decomposition from contextual knowledge into a continuous graph ODE framework.
  Specifically, PGODE employs representation disentanglement and system parameters
  to extract both object-level and system-level contexts from historical trajectories,
  which allows us to explicitly model their independent influence and thus enhances
  the generalization capability under system changes. Then, we integrate these disentangled
  latent representations into a graph ODE model, which determines a combination of
  various interacting prototypes for enhanced model expressivity. The entire model
  is optimized using an end-to-end variational inference framework to maximize the
  likelihood. Extensive experiments in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution
  settings validate the superiority of PGODE compared to various baselines.
