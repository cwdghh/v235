title: 'SleepFM: Multi-modal Representation Learning for Sleep Across Brain Activity,
  ECG and Respiratory Signals'
openreview: QXqXGDapkQ
abstract: Sleep is a complex physiological process evaluated through various modalities
  recording electrical brain, cardiac, and respiratory activities. We curate a large
  polysomnography dataset from over 14,000 participants comprising over 100,000 hours
  of multi-modal sleep recordings. Leveraging this extensive dataset, we developed
  SleepFM, the first multi-modal foundation model for sleep analysis. We show that
  a novel leave-one-out approach for contrastive learning significantly improves downstream
  task performance compared to representations from standard pairwise contrastive
  learning. A logistic regression model trained on SleepFMâ€™s learned embeddings outperforms
  an end-to-end trained convolutional neural network (CNN) on sleep stage classification
  (macro AUROC 0.88 vs 0.72 and macro AUPRC 0.72 vs 0.48) and sleep disordered breathing
  detection (AUROC 0.85 vs 0.69 and AUPRC 0.77 vs 0.61). Notably, the learned embeddings
  achieve 48% top-1 average accuracy in retrieving modality clip pairs from 90,000
  candidates. This work demonstrates the value of holistic multi-modal sleep modeling
  to fully capture the richness of sleep recordings. SleepFM is open source and available
  at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/sleepfm.
