title: Improving Equivariant Graph Neural Networks on Large Geometric Graphs via Virtual
  Nodes Learning
openreview: wWdkNkUY8k
abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have made remarkable success in
  a variety of scientific applications. However, existing equivariant GNNs encounter
  the efficiency issue for large geometric graphs and perform poorly if the input
  is reduced to sparse local graph for speed acceleration. In this paper, we propose
  FastEGNN, an enhanced model of equivariant GNNs on large geometric graphs. The central
  idea is leveraging a small ordered set of virtual nodes to approximate the large
  unordered graph of real nodes. In particular, we distinguish the message passing
  and aggregation for different virtual node to encourage the mutual distinctiveness,
  and minimize the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between virtual and real coordinates
  to realize the global distributedness. FastEGNN meets all necessary E(3) symmetries,
  with certain universal expressivity assurance as well. Our experiments on N-body
  systems (100 nodes), proteins (800 nodes) and water-3D (8000 nodes), demonstrate
  that FastEGNN achieves a promising balance between accuracy and efficiency, and
  outperforms EGNN in accuracy even after dropping all edges in real systems like
  proteins and water-3D.
