title: Do Language Models Exhibit the Same Cognitive Biases in Problem Solving as
  Human Learners?
openreview: k1JXxbpIY6
abstract: 'There is increasing interest in employing large language models (LLMs)
  as cognitive models. For such purposes, it is central to understand which properties
  of human cognition are well-modeled by LLMs, and which are not. In this work, we
  study the biases of LLMs in relation to those known in children when solving arithmetic
  word problems. Surveying the learning science literature, we posit that the problem-solving
  process can be split into three distinct steps: text comprehension, solution planning
  and solution execution. We construct tests for each one in order to understand whether
  current LLMs display the same cognitive biases as children in these steps. We generate
  a novel set of word problems for each of these tests, using a neuro-symbolic approach
  that enables fine-grained control over the problem features. We find evidence that
  LLMs, with and without instruction-tuning, exhibit human-like biases in both the
  text-comprehension and the solution-planning steps of the solving process, but not
  in the final step, in which the arithmetic expressions are executed to obtain the
  answer.'
