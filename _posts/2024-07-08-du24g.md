title: When and How Does In-Distribution Label Help Out-of-Distribution Detection?
openreview: knhbhDLdry
abstract: 'Detecting data points deviating from the training distribution is pivotal
  for ensuring reliable machine learning. Extensive research has been dedicated to
  the challenge, spanning classical anomaly detection techniques to contemporary out-of-distribution
  (OOD) detection approaches. While OOD detection commonly relies on supervised learning
  from a labeled in-distribution (ID) dataset, anomaly detection may treat the entire
  ID data as a single class and disregard ID labels. This fundamental distinction
  raises a significant question that has yet to be rigorously explored: when and how
  does ID label help OOD detection? This paper bridges this gap by offering a formal
  understanding to theoretically delineate the impact of ID labels on OOD detection.
  We employ a graph-theoretic approach, rigorously analyzing the separability of ID
  data from OOD data in a closed-form manner. Key to our approach is the characterization
  of data representations through spectral decomposition on the graph. Leveraging
  these representations, we establish a provable error bound that compares the OOD
  detection performance with and without ID labels, unveiling conditions for achieving
  enhanced OOD detection. Lastly, we present empirical results on both simulated and
  real datasets, validating theoretical guarantees and reinforcing our insights.'
