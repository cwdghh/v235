title: 'OSSCAR: One-Shot Structured Pruning in Vision and Language Models with Combinatorial
  Optimization'
openreview: ZctlF8RlV4
abstract: Structured pruning is a promising approach for reducing the inference costs
  of large vision and language models. By removing carefully chosen structures, e.g.,
  neurons or attention heads, the improvements from this approach can be realized
  on standard deep learning hardware. In this work, we focus on structured pruning
  in the one-shot (post-training) setting, which does not require model retraining
  after pruning. We propose a novel combinatorial optimization framework for this
  problem, based on a layer-wise reconstruction objective and a careful reformulation
  that allows for scalable optimization. Moreover, we design a new local combinatorial
  optimization algorithm, which exploits low-rank updates for efficient local search.
  Our framework is time and memory-efficient and considerably improves upon state-of-the-art
  one-shot methods on vision models (e.g., ResNet50, MobileNet) and language models
  (e.g., OPT-1.3B – OPT-30B). For language models, e.g., OPT-2.7B, OSSCAR can lead
  to $125\times$ lower test perplexity on WikiText with $2\times$ inference time speedup
  in comparison to the state-of-the-art ZipLM approach. Our framework is also $6\times$
  – $8\times$ faster. Notably, our work considers models with tens of billions of
  parameters, which is up to $100\times$ larger than what has been previously considered
  in the structured pruning literature. Our code is available at https://github.com/mazumder-lab/OSSCAR.
