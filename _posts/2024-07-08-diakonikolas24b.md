title: Fast Co-Training under Weak Dependence via Stream-Based Active Learning
openreview: GqWy1wZKeE
abstract: Co-training is a classical semi-supervised learning method which only requires
  a small number of labeled examples for learning, under reasonable assumptions. Despite
  extensive literature on the topic, very few hypothesis classes are known to be provably
  efficiently learnable via co-training, even under very strong distributional assumptions.
  In this work, we study the co-training problem in the stream-based active learning
  model. We show that a range of natural concept classes are efficiently learnable
  via co-training, in terms of both label efficiency and computational efficiency.
  We provide an efficient reduction of co-training under the standard assumption of
  weak dependence, in the stream-based active model, to online classification. As
  a corollary, we obtain efficient co-training algorithms with error independent label
  complexity for every concept class class efficiently learnable in the mistake bound
  online model. Our framework also gives co-training algorithms with label complexity
  $\tilde{O}(d\log (1/\epsilon))$ for any concept class with VC dimension $d$, though
  in general this reduction is not computationally efficient. Finally, using additional
  ideas from online learning, we design the first efficient co-training algorithms
  with label complexity $\tilde{O}(d^2\log (1/\epsilon))$ for several concept classes,
  including unions of intervals and homogeneous halfspaces.
