title: Enhancing Trajectory Prediction through Self-Supervised Waypoint Distortion
  Prediction
openreview: OQ7TlOphGX
abstract: Trajectory prediction is an important task that involves modeling the indeterminate
  nature of agents to forecast future trajectories given the observed trajectory sequences.
  The task of predicting trajectories poses significant challenges, as agents not
  only move individually through time but also interact spatially. The learning of
  complex spatio-temporal representations stands as a fundamental challenge in trajectory
  prediction. To this end, we propose a novel approach called SSWDP (Self-Supervised
  Waypoint Distortion Prediction). We propose a simple yet highly effective self-supervised
  task of predicting distortion present in the observed trajectories to improve the
  representation learning of the model. Our approach can complement existing trajectory
  prediction methods. The experimental results highlight a significant improvement
  with relative percentage differences of 22.7%/38.9%, 33.8%/36.4%, and 16.60%/23.20%
  in ADE/FDE for the NBA, TrajNet++, and ETH-UCY datasets, respectively, compared
  to the baseline methods. Our approach also demonstrates a significant improvement
  over baseline methods with relative percentage differences of 76.8%/82.5% and 61.0%/36.1%
  in ADE/FDE for TrajNet++ and NBA datasets in distorted environments, respectively.
