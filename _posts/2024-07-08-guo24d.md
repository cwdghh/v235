title: 'ACM-MILP: Adaptive Constraint Modification via Grouping and Selection for
  Hardness-Preserving MILP Instance Generation'
openreview: qDAAMmGsGw
abstract: 'Data plays a pivotal role in the development of both classic and learning-based
  methods for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). However, the scarcity of data
  in real-world applications underscores the necessity for MILP instance generation
  methods. Currently, these methods primarily rely on iterating random single-constraint
  modifications, disregarding the underlying problem structure with constraint interrelations,
  thereby leading to compromised quality and solvability. In this paper, we propose
  ACM-MILP, a framework for MILP instance generation, to achieve adaptive constraint
  modification and constraint interrelation modeling. It employs an adaptive constraint
  selection mechanism based on probability estimation within the latent space to preserve
  instance characteristics. Meanwhile, it detects and groups strongly related constraints
  through community detection, enabling collective modifications that account for
  constraint dependencies. Experimental results show significant improvements in problem-solving
  hardness similarity under our framework. Additionally, in the downstream task, we
  showcase the efficacy of our generated instances for hyperparameter tuning. Source
