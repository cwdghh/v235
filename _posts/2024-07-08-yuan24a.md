title: 'Smoothing Proximal Gradient Methods for Nonsmooth Sparsity Constrained Optimization:
  Optimality Conditions and Global Convergence'
openreview: Zs3qW8Njov
abstract: 'Nonsmooth sparsity constrained optimization encompasses a broad spectrum
  of applications in machine learning. This problem is generally non-convex and NP-hard.
  Existing solutions to this problem exhibit several notable limitations, including
  their inability to address general nonsmooth problems, tendency to yield weaker
  optimality conditions, and lack of comprehensive convergence analysis. This paper
  considers Smoothing Proximal Gradient Methods (SPGM) as solutions to nonsmooth sparsity
  constrained optimization problems. Two specific variants of SPGM are explored: one
  based on Iterative Hard Thresholding (SPGM-IHT) and the other on Block Coordinate
  Decomposition (SPGM-BCD). It is shown that the SPGM-BCD algorithm finds stronger
  stationary points compared to previous methods. Additionally, novel theories for
  analyzing the convergence rates to approximate global optimal solutions of both
  the SPGM-IHT and SPGM-BCD algorithms are developed. Our theoretical bounds, capitalizing
  on the intrinsic sparsity of the optimization problem, are on par with the best-known
  error bounds available to date. Finally, numerical experiments reveal that SPGM-IHT
  performs comparably to current IHT-style methods, while SPGM-BCD consistently surpasses
  them.'
