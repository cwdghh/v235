title: Reducing Item Discrepancy via Differentially Private Robust Embedding Alignment
  for Privacy-Preserving Cross Domain Recommendation
openreview: rk4kmL8aOY
abstract: Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) have become increasingly appealing by
  leveraging useful information to tackle the data sparsity problem across domains.
  Most of latest CDR models assume that domain-shareable user-item information (e.g.,
  rating and review on overlapped users or items) are accessible across domains. However,
  these assumptions become impractical due to the strict data privacy protection policy.
  In this paper, we propose Reducing Item Discrepancy (RidCDR) model on solving Privacy-Preserving
  Cross-Domain Recommendation (PPCDR) problem. Specifically, we aim to enhance the
  model performance on both source and target domains without overlapped users and
  items while protecting the data privacy. We innovatively propose private-robust
  embedding alignment module in RidCDR for knowledge sharing across domains while
  avoiding negative transfer privately. Our empirical study on Amazon and Douban datasets
  demonstrates that RidCDR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models under
  the PPCDR without overlapped users and items.
