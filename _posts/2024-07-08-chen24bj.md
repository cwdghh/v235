title: Compact Optimality Verification for Optimization Proxies
openreview: OdsZS0E0AO
abstract: Recent years have witnessed increasing interest in optimization proxies,
  i.e., machine learning models that approximate the input-output mapping of parametric
  optimization problems and return near-optimal feasible solutions. Following recent
  work by (Nellikkath & Chatzivasileiadis, 2021), this paper reconsiders the optimality
  verification problem for optimization proxies, i.e., the determination of the worst-case
  optimality gap over the instance distribution. The paper proposes a compact formulation
  for optimality verification and a gradient-based primal heuristic that brings significant
  computational benefits to the original formulation. The compact formulation is also
  more general and applies to non-convex optimization problems. The benefits of the
  compact formulation are demonstrated on large-scale DC Optimal Power Flow and knapsack
  problems.
