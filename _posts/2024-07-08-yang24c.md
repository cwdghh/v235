title: Sample-Efficient Multiagent Reinforcement Learning with Reset Replay
openreview: w8ei1o9U5y
abstract: The popularity of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) is growing rapidly
  with the demand for real-world tasks that require swarm intelligence. However, a
  noticeable drawback of MARL is its low sample efficiency, which leads to a huge
  amount of interactions with the environment. Surprisingly, few MARL works focus
  on this practical problem especially in the parallel environment setting, which
  greatly hampers the application of MARL into the real world. In response to this
  gap, in this paper, we propose Multiagent Reinforcement Learning with Reset Replay
  (MARR) to greatly improve the sample efficiency of MARL by enabling MARL training
  at a high replay ratio in the parallel environment setting for the first time. To
  achieve this, first, a reset strategy is introduced for maintaining the network
  plasticity to ensure that MARL continually learns with a high replay ratio. Second,
  MARR incorporates a data augmentation technique to boost the sample efficiency further.
  Extensive experiments in SMAC and MPE show that MARR significantly improves the
  performance of various MARL approaches with much fewer environment interactions.
