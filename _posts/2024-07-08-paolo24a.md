title: 'Position: A Call for Embodied AI'
openreview: e5admkWKgV
abstract: We propose Embodied AI (E-AI) as the next fundamental step in the pursuit
  of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), juxtaposing it against current AI advancements,
  particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). We traverse the evolution of the embodiment
  concept across diverse fields (philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, and robotics)
  to highlight how E-AI distinguishes itself from the classical paradigm of static
  learning. By broadening the scope of E-AI, we introduce a theoretical framework
  based on cognitive architectures, emphasizing perception, action, memory, and learning
  as essential components of an embodied agent. This framework is aligned with Friston’s
  active inference principle, offering a comprehensive approach to E-AI development.
  Despite the progress made in the field of AI, substantial challenges, such as the
  formulation of a novel AI learning theory and the innovation of advanced hardware,
  persist. Our discussion lays down a foundational guideline for future E-AI research.
  Highlighting the importance of creating E-AI agents capable of seamless communication,
  collaboration, and coexistence with humans and other intelligent entities within
  real-world environments, we aim to steer the AI community towards addressing the
  multifaceted challenges and seizing the opportunities that lie ahead in the quest
  for AGI.
