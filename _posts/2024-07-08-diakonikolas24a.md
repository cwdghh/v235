title: Robust Sparse Estimation for Gaussians with Optimal Error under Huber Contamination
openreview: E3V5MMwFgd
abstract: We study Gaussian sparse estimation tasks in Huberâ€™s contamination model
  with a focus on mean estimation, PCA, and linear regression. For each of these tasks,
  we give the first sample and computationally efficient robust estimators with optimal
  error guarantees, within constant factors. All prior efficient algorithms for these
  tasks incur quantitatively suboptimal error. Concretely, for Gaussian robust $k$-sparse
  mean estimation on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with corruption rate $\epsilon>0$, our algorithm
  has sample complexity $(k^2/\epsilon ^2)\mathrm{polylog}(d/\epsilon)$, runs in sample
  polynomial time, and approximates the target mean within $\ell_2$-error $O(\epsilon)$.
  Previous efficient algorithms inherently incur error $\Omega(\epsilon \sqrt{\log(1/\epsilon)})$.
  At the technical level, we develop a novel multidimensional filtering method in
  the sparse regime that may find other applications.
