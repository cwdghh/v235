title: A New Computationally Efficient Algorithm to solve Feature Selection for Functional
  Data Classification in High-dimensional Spaces
openreview: a7MW5kFFOf
abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology for Feature Selection for Functional
  Classification, FSFC, that addresses the challenge of jointly performing feature
  selection and classification of functional data in scenarios with categorical responses
  and multivariate longitudinal features. FSFC tackles a newly defined optimization
  problem that integrates logistic loss and functional features to identify the most
  crucial variables for classification. To address the minimization procedure, we
  employ functional principal components and develop a new adaptive version of the
  Dual Augmented Lagrangian algorithm. The computational efficiency of FSFC enables
  handling high-dimensional scenarios where the number of features may considerably
  exceed the number of statistical units. Simulation experiments demonstrate that
  FSFC outperforms other machine learning and deep learning methods in computational
  time and classification accuracy. Furthermore, the FSFC feature selection capability
  can be leveraged to significantly reduce the problemâ€™s dimensionality and enhance
  the performances of other classification algorithms. The efficacy of FSFC is also
  demonstrated through a real data application, analyzing relationships between four
  chronic diseases and other health and demographic factors. FSFC source code is publicly
  available at https://github.com/IBM/funGCN.
