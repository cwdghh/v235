title: Optimal Batched Linear Bandits
openreview: DM0r4qatjT
abstract: We introduce the E$^4$ algorithm for the batched linear bandit problem,
  incorporating an Explore-Estimate-Eliminate-Exploit framework. With a proper choice
  of exploration rate, we prove E$^4$ achieves the finite-time minimax optimal regret
  with only $O(\log\log T)$ batches, and the asymptotically optimal regret with only
  $3$ batches as $T\rightarrow\infty$, where $T$ is the time horizon. We further prove
  a lower bound on the batch complexity of liner contextual bandits showing that any
  asymptotically optimal algorithm must require at least $3$ batches in expectation
  as $T\rightarrow \infty$, which indicates E$^4$ achieves the asymptotic optimality
  in regret and batch complexity simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, E$^4$
  is the first algorithm for linear bandits that simultaneously achieves the minimax
  and asymptotic optimality in regret with the corresponding optimal batch complexities.
  In addition, we show that with another choice of exploration rate E$^4$ achieves
  an instance-dependent regret bound requiring at most $O(\log T)$ batches, and maintains
  the minimax optimality and asymptotic optimality. We conduct thorough experiments
  to evaluate our algorithm on randomly generated instances and the challenging <em>End
  of Optimism</em> instances (Lattimore & Szepesvari, 2017) which were shown to be
  hard to learn for optimism based algorithms. Empirical results show that E$^4$ consistently
  outperforms baseline algorithms with respect to regret minimization, batch complexity,
  and computational efficiency.
