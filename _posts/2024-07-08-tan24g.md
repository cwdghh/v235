title: Post-hoc Part-Prototype Networks
openreview: jhWSzTO0Jl
abstract: 'Post-hoc explainability methods such as Grad-CAM are popular because they
  do not influence the performance of a trained model. However, they mainly reveal
  ”where” a model looks at for a given input, fail to explain ”what” the model looks
  for (e.g., what is important to classify a bird image to a Scott Oriole?). Existing
  part-prototype networks leverage part-prototypes (e.g., characteristic Scott Oriole’s
  wing and head) to answer both ”where" and ”what", but often under-perform their
  black box counterparts in the accuracy. Therefore, a natural question is: can one
  construct a network that answers both ”where” and ”what" in a post-hoc manner to
  guarantee the model’s performance? To this end, we propose the first post-hoc part-prototype
  network via decomposing the classification head of a trained model into a set of
  interpretable part-prototypes. Concretely, we propose an unsupervised prototype
  discovery and refining strategy to obtain prototypes that can precisely reconstruct
  the classification head, yet being interpretable. Besides guaranteeing the performance,
  we show that our network offers more faithful explanations qualitatively and yields
  even better part-prototypes quantitatively than prior part-prototype networks.'
