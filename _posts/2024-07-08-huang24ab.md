title: Interaction-based Retrieval-augmented Diffusion Models for Protein-specific
  3D Molecule Generation
openreview: eejhD9FCP3
abstract: 'Generating ligand molecules that bind to specific protein targets via generative
  models holds substantial promise for advancing structure-based drug design. Existing
  methods generate molecules from scratch without reference or template ligands, which
  poses challenges in model optimization and may yield suboptimal outcomes. To address
  this problem, we propose an innovative interaction-based retrieval-augmented diffusion
  model named IRDiff to facilitate target-aware molecule generation. IRDiff leverages
  a curated set of ligand references, i.e., those with desired properties such as
  high binding affinity, to steer the diffusion model towards synthesizing ligands
  that satisfy design criteria. Specifically, we utilize a protein-molecule interaction
  network (PMINet), which is pretrained with binding affinity signals to: (i) retrieve
  target-aware ligand molecules with high binding affinity to serve as references,
  and (ii) incorporate essential protein-ligand binding structures for steering molecular
  diffusion generation with two effective augmentation mechanisms, i.e., retrieval
  augmentation and self augmentation. Empirical studies on CrossDocked2020 dataset
  show IRDiff can generate molecules with more realistic 3D structures and achieve
  state-of-the-art binding affinities towards the protein targets, while maintaining
  proper molecular properties. The codes and models are available at https://github.com/YangLing0818/IRDiff'
