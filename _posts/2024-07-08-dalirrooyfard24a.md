title: 'Pruned Pivot: Correlation Clustering Algorithm for Dynamic, Parallel, and
  Local Computation Models'
openreview: saP7s0ZgYE
abstract: Given a graph with positive and negative edge labels, the correlation clustering
  problem aims to cluster the nodes so to minimize the total number of between-cluster
  positive and within-cluster negative edges. This problem has many applications in
  data mining, particularly in unsupervised learning. Inspired by the prevalence of
  large graphs and constantly changing data in modern applications, we study correlation
  clustering in dynamic, parallel (MPC), and local computation (LCA) settings. We
  design an approach that improves state-of-the-art runtime complexities in all these
  settings. In particular, we provide the first fully dynamic algorithm that runs
  in an expected amortized constant time, without any dependence on the graph size.
  Moreover, our algorithm essentially matches the approximation guarantee of the celebrated
  Pivot algorithm.
