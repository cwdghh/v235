title: 'STELLA: Continual Audio-Video Pre-training with SpatioTemporal Localized Alignment'
openreview: u4VR3WBH7a
abstract: 'Continuously learning a variety of audio-video semantics over time is crucial
  for audio-related reasoning tasks in our ever-evolving world. However, this is a
  nontrivial problem and poses two critical challenges: sparse spatio-temporal correlation
  between audio-video pairs and multimodal correlation overwriting that forgets audio-video
  relations. To tackle this problem, we propose a new continual audio-video pre-training
  method with two novel ideas: (1) Localized Patch Importance Scoring: we introduce
  a multimodal encoder to determine the importance score for each patch, emphasizing
  semantically intertwined audio-video patches. (2) Replay-guided Correlation Assessment:
  to reduce the corruption of previously learned audiovisual knowledge due to drift,
  we propose to assess the correlation of the current patches on the past steps to
  identify the patches exhibiting high correlations with the past steps. Based on
  the results from the two ideas, we perform probabilistic patch selection for effective
  continual audio-video pre-training. Experimental validation on multiple benchmarks
  shows that our method achieves a $3.69%$p of relative performance gain in zero-shot
  retrieval tasks compared to strong continual learning baselines, while reducing
  memory consumption by $\sim 45 %$.'
