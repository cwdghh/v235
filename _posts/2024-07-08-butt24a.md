title: 'CodeIt: Self-Improving Language Models with Prioritized Hindsight Replay'
openreview: SXVn5IFsrs
abstract: Large language models are increasingly solving tasks that are commonly believed
  to require human-level reasoning ability. However, these models still perform very
  poorly on benchmarks of general intelligence such as the Abstraction and Reasoning
  Corpus (ARC). In this paper, we approach the ARC as a programming-by-examples problem,
  and introduce a novel and scalable method for language model self-improvement called
  Code Iteration (CodeIt). Our method iterates between 1) program sampling and hindsight
  relabeling, and 2) learning from prioritized experience replay. By relabeling the
  goal of an episode (i.e., the program output given input) to the output actually
  produced by the sampled program, our method effectively deals with the extreme sparsity
  of rewards in program synthesis. Applying CodeIt to the ARC dataset, we demonstrate
  that prioritized hindsight replay, along with pre-training and data-augmentation,
  leads to successful inter-task generalization. CodeIt is the first neuro-symbolic
  approach that scales to the full ARC evaluation dataset. Our method solves 15% of
  ARC evaluation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance and outperforming existing
  neural and symbolic baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/Qualcomm-AI-research/codeit.
