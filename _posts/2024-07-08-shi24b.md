title: 'OT-CLIP: Understanding and Generalizing CLIP via Optimal Transport'
openreview: X8uQ1TslUc
abstract: 'We propose to understand Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining model (CLIP)
  from the Optimal Transport (OT) perspective. Specifically, we show that training
  of CLIP is an embodiment of inverse OT and the adopted two InfoNCE losses in CLIP
  correspond to a special case of bilevel optimization of modified entropic OT. We
  then generalize the original CLIP loss to an OT-based loss family using variants
  of Regularized OT (e.g. Fused Gromov OT, unbalanced OT, etc.), and demonstrate their
  superior performance on public datasets for both image and text downstream tasks.
  We also rethink the inference stage of CLIP by using the tool of OT, and propose
  to adopt the fused Gromov OT for (zero-shot) classification, in which the prediction
  is based on the graph representation whereby images and texts are nodes for graph
  matching. By our new technique, we show how to generalize zero-shot classification
  to other more flexible zero-shot tasks with competitive performance: long-tailed
  classification and selective classification. The former assumes the known prior
  distribution of labels, while in the latter case, only a subset of samples are asked
  to predict, yet with high prediction confidence.'
