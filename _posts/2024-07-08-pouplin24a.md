title: 'Relaxed Quantile Regression: Prediction Intervals for Asymmetric Noise'
openreview: L8nSGvoyvb
abstract: Constructing valid prediction intervals rather than point estimates is a
  well-established approach for uncertainty quantification in the regression setting.
  Models equipped with this capacity output an interval of values in which the ground
  truth target will fall with some prespecified probability. This is an essential
  requirement in many real-world applications where simple point predictionsâ€™ inability
  to convey the magnitude and frequency of errors renders them insufficient for high-stakes
  decisions. Quantile regression is a leading approach for obtaining such intervals
  via the empirical estimation of quantiles in the (non-parametric) distribution of
  outputs. This method is simple, computationally inexpensive, interpretable, assumption-free,
  and effective. However, it does require that the specific quantiles being learned
  are chosen a priori. This results in (a) intervals that are arbitrarily symmetric
  around the median which is sub-optimal for realistic skewed distributions, or (b)
  learning an excessive number of intervals. In this work, we propose Relaxed Quantile
  Regression (RQR), a direct alternative to quantile regression based interval construction
  that removes this arbitrary constraint whilst maintaining its strengths. We demonstrate
  that this added flexibility results in intervals with an improvement in desirable
  qualities (e.g. mean width) whilst retaining the essential coverage guarantees of
  quantile regression.
