title: Robust Stable Spiking Neural Networks
openreview: lIYtJtpJR0
abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are gaining popularity in deep learning due
  to their low energy budget on neuromorphic hardware. However, they still face challenges
  in lacking sufficient robustness to guard safety-critical applications such as autonomous
  driving. Many studies have been conducted to defend SNNs from the threat of adversarial
  attacks. This paper aims to uncover the robustness of SNN through the lens of the
  stability of nonlinear systems. We are inspired by the fact that searching for parameters
  altering the leaky integrate-and-fire dynamics can enhance their robustness. Thus,
  we dive into the dynamics of membrane potential perturbation and simplify the formulation
  of the dynamics. We present that membrane potential perturbation dynamics can reliably
  convey the intensity of perturbation. Our theoretical analyses imply that the simplified
  perturbation dynamics satisfy input-output stability. Thus, we propose a training
  framework with modified SNN neurons and to reduce the mean square of membrane potential
  perturbation aiming at enhancing the robustness of SNN. Finally, we experimentally
  verify the effectiveness of the framework in the setting of Gaussian noise training
  and adversarial training on the image classification task. Please refer to https://github.com/DingJianhao/stable-snn
  for our code implementation.
