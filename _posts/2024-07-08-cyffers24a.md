title: Differentially Private Decentralized Learning with Random Walks
openreview: k2dVVIWWho
abstract: The popularity of federated learning comes from the possibility of better
  scalability and the ability for participants to keep control of their data, improving
  data security and sovereignty. Unfortunately, sharing model updates also creates
  a new privacy attack surface. In this work, we characterize the privacy guarantees
  of decentralized learning with random walk algorithms, where a model is updated
  by traveling from one node to another along the edges of a communication graph.
  Using a recent variant of differential privacy tailored to the study of decentralized
  algorithms, namely Pairwise Network Differential Privacy, we derive closed-form
  expressions for the privacy loss between each pair of nodes where the impact of
  the communication topology is captured by graph theoretic quantities. Our results
  further reveal that random walk algorithms tends to yield better privacy guarantees
  than gossip algorithms for nodes close from each other. We supplement our theoretical
  results with empirical evaluation on synthetic and real-world graphs and datasets.
