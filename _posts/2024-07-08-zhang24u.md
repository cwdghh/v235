title: Inherent Trade-Offs between Diversity and Stability in Multi-Task Benchmarks
openreview: fwxnHViGNj
abstract: 'We examine multi-task benchmarks in machine learning through the lens of
  social choice theory. We draw an analogy between benchmarks and electoral systems,
  where models are candidates and tasks are voters. This suggests a distinction between
  cardinal and ordinal benchmark systems. The former aggregate numerical scores into
  one model ranking; the latter aggregate rankings for each task. We apply Arrow’s
  impossibility theorem to ordinal benchmarks to highlight the inherent limitations
  of ordinal systems, particularly their sensitivity to the inclusion of irrelevant
  models. Inspired by Arrow’s theorem, we empirically demonstrate a strong trade-off
  between diversity and sensitivity to irrelevant changes in existing multi-task benchmarks.
  Our result is based on new quantitative measures of diversity and sensitivity that
  we introduce. Sensitivity quantifies the impact that irrelevant changes to tasks
  have on a benchmark. Diversity captures the degree of disagreement in model rankings
  across tasks. We develop efficient approximation algorithms for both measures, as
  exact computation is computationally challenging. Through extensive experiments
  on seven cardinal benchmarks and eleven ordinal benchmarks, we demonstrate a clear
  trade-off between diversity and stability: The more diverse a multi-task benchmark,
  the more sensitive to trivial changes it is. Additionally, we show that the aggregated
  rankings of existing benchmarks are highly unstable under irrelevant changes. The
  codes and data are available at https://socialfoundations.github.io/benchbench/.'
