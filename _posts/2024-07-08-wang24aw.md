title: 'EvoluNet: Advancing Dynamic Non-IID Transfer Learning on Graphs'
openreview: anM1M5aoM8
abstract: 'Non-IID transfer learning on graphs is crucial in many high-stakes domains.
  The majority of existing works assume stationary distribution for both source and
  target domains. However, real-world graphs are intrinsically dynamic, presenting
  challenges in terms of domain evolution and dynamic discrepancy between source and
  target domains. To bridge the gap, we shift the problem to the dynamic setting and
  pose the question: given the <em>label-rich</em> source graphs and the <em>label-scarce</em>
  target graphs both observed in previous $T$ timestamps, how can we effectively characterize
  the evolving domain discrepancy and optimize the generalization performance of the
  target domain at the incoming $T+1$ timestamp? To answer it, we propose a generalization
  bound for <em>dynamic non-IID transfer learning on graphs</em>, which implies the
  generalization performance is dominated by domain evolution and domain discrepancy
  between source and target graphs. Inspired by the theoretical results, we introduce
  a novel generic framework named EvoluNet. It leverages a transformer-based temporal
  encoding module to model temporal information of the evolving domains and then uses
  a dynamic domain unification module to efficiently learn domain-invariant representations
  across the source and target domains. Finally, EvoluNet outperforms the state-of-the-art
  models by up to 12.1%, demonstrating its effectiveness in transferring knowledge
  from dynamic source graphs to dynamic target graphs.'
