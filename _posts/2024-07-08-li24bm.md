title: 'VQDNA: Unleashing the Power of Vector Quantization for Multi-Species Genomic
  Sequence Modeling'
openreview: BOunbuapcv
abstract: Similar to natural language models, pre-trained genome language models are
  proposed to capture the underlying intricacies within genomes with unsupervised
  sequence modeling. They have become essential tools for researchers and practitioners
  in biology. However, the hand-crafted tokenization policies used in these models
  may not encode the most discriminative patterns from the limited vocabulary of genomic
  data. In this paper, we introduce VQDNA, a general-purpose framework that renovates
  genome tokenization from the perspective of genome vocabulary learning. By leveraging
  vector-quantized codebook as learnable vocabulary, VQDNA can adaptively tokenize
  genomes into pattern-aware embeddings in an end-to-end manner. To further push its
  limits, we propose Hierarchical Residual Quantization (HRQ), where varying scales
  of codebooks are designed in a hierarchy to enrich the genome vocabulary in a coarse-to-fine
  manner. Extensive experiments on 32 genome datasets demonstrate VQDNAâ€™s superiority
  and favorable parameter efficiency compared to existing genome language models.
  Notably, empirical analysis of SARS-CoV-2 mutations reveals the fine-grained pattern
  awareness and biological significance of learned HRQ vocabulary, highlighting its
  untapped potential for broader applications in genomics.
