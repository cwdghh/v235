title: High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization via Semi-Supervised Learning with Optimized
  Unlabeled Data Sampling
openreview: beXQVQorse
abstract: We introduce a novel semi-supervised learning approach, named Teacher-Student
  Bayesian Optimization ($\texttt{TSBO}$), integrating the teacher-student paradigm
  into BO to minimize expensive labeled data queries for the first time. $\texttt{TSBO}$
  incorporates a teacher model, an unlabeled data sampler, and a student model. The
  student is trained on unlabeled data locations generated by the sampler, with pseudo
  labels predicted by the teacher. The interplay between these three components implements
  a unique <em>selective regularization</em> to the teacher in the form of student
  feedback. This scheme enables the teacher to predict high-quality pseudo labels,
  enhancing the generalization of the GP surrogate model in the search space. To fully
  exploit $\texttt{TSBO}$, we propose two optimized unlabeled data samplers to construct
  effective student feedback that well aligns with the objective of Bayesian optimization.
  Furthermore, we quantify and leverage the uncertainty of the teacher-student model
  for the provision of reliable feedback to the teacher in the presence of risky pseudo-label
  predictions. $\texttt{TSBO}$ demonstrates significantly improved sample-efficiency
  in several global optimization tasks under tight labeled data budgets. The implementation
  is available at https://github.com/reminiscenty/TSBO-Official.
