title: Testing the Feasibility of Linear Programs with Bandit Feedback
openreview: TfwGtfPkhV
abstract: 'While the recent literature has seen a surge in the study of constrained
  bandit problems, all existing methods for these begin by assuming the feasibility
  of the underlying problem. We initiate the study of testing such feasibility assumptions,
  and in particular address the problem in the linear bandit setting, thus characterising
  the costs of feasibility testing for an unknown linear program using bandit feedback.
  Concretely, we test if $\exists x: Ax \ge 0$ for an unknown $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m
  \times d}$, by playing a sequence of actions $x_t\in \mathbb{R}^d$, and observing
  $Ax_t + \mathrm{noise}$ in response. By identifying the hypothesis as determining
  the sign of the value of a minimax game, we construct a novel test based on low-regret
  algorithms and a nonasymptotic law of iterated logarithms. We prove that this test
  is reliable, and adapts to the ‘signal level,’ $\Gamma,$ of any instance, with mean
  sample costs scaling as $\widetilde{O}(d^2/\Gamma^2)$. We complement this by a minimax
  lower bound of $\Omega(d/\Gamma^2)$ for sample costs of reliable tests, dominating
  prior asymptotic lower bounds by capturing the dependence on $d$, and thus elucidating
  a basic insight missing in the extant literature on such problems.'
