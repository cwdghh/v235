title: Criterion Collapse and Loss Distribution Control
openreview: WVORGH73Cg
abstract: In this work, we consider the notion of "criterion collapse," in which optimization
  of one metric implies optimality in another, with a particular focus on conditions
  for collapse into error probability minimizers under a wide variety of learning
  criteria, ranging from DRO and OCE risks (CVaR, tilted ERM) to non-monotonic criteria
  underlying recent ascent-descent algorithms explored in the literature (Flooding,
  SoftAD). We show how collapse in the context of losses with a Bernoulli distribution
  goes far beyond existing results for CVaR and DRO, then expand our scope to include
  surrogate losses, showing conditions where monotonic criteria such as tilted ERM
  cannot avoid collapse, whereas non-monotonic alternatives can.
