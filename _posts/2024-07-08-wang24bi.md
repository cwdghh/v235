title: 'Proteus: Exploring Protein Structure Generation for Enhanced Designability
  and Efficiency'
openreview: IckJCzsGVS
abstract: Diffusion-based generative models have been successfully employed to create
  proteins with novel structures and functions. However, the construction of such
  models typically depends on large, pre-trained structure prediction networks, like
  RFdiffusion. In contrast, alternative models that are trained from scratch, such
  as FrameDiff, still fall short in performance. In this context, we introduce Proteus,
  an innovative deep diffusion network that incorporates graph-based triangle methods
  and a multi-track interaction network, eliminating the dependency on structure prediction
  pre-training with superior efficiency. We have validated our model’s performance
  on de novo protein backbone generation through comprehensive in silico evaluations
  and experimental characterizations, which demonstrate a remarkable success rate.
  These promising results underscore Proteus’s ability to generate highly designable
  protein backbones efficiently. This capability, achieved without reliance on pre-training
  techniques, has the potential to significantly advance the field of protein design.
