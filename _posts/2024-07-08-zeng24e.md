title: Graph Mixup on Approximate Gromov–Wasserstein Geodesics
openreview: PKdege0U6Z
abstract: Mixup, which generates synthetic training samples on the data manifold,
  has been shown to be highly effective in augmenting Euclidean data. However, finding
  a proper data manifold for graph data is non-trivial, as graphs are non-Euclidean
  data in disparate spaces. Though efforts have been made, most of the existing graph
  mixup methods neglect the intrinsic geodesic guarantee, thereby generating inconsistent
  sample-label pairs. To address this issue, we propose GeoMix to mixup graphs on
  the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) geodesics. A joint space over input graphs is first
  defined based on the GW distance, and graphs are then transformed into the GW space
  through equivalence-preserving transformations. We further show that the linear
  interpolation of the transformed graph pairs defines a geodesic connecting the original
  pairs on the GW manifold, hence ensuring the consistency between generated samples
  and labels. An accelerated mixup algorithm on the approximate low-dimensional GW
  manifold is further proposed. Extensive experiments show that the proposed GeoMix
  promotes the generalization and robustness of GNN models.
