title: Robust Inverse Graphics via Probabilistic Inference
openreview: dwWef5w2cR
abstract: How do we infer a 3D scene from a single image in the presence of corruptions
  like rain, snow or fog? Straightforward domain randomization relies on knowing the
  family of corruptions ahead of time. Here, we propose a Bayesian approach—dubbed
  robust inverse graphics (RIG)—that relies on a strong scene prior and an uninformative
  uniform corruption prior, making it applicable to a wide range of corruptions. Given
  a single image, RIG performs posterior inference jointly over the scene and the
  corruption. We demonstrate this idea by training a neural radiance field (NeRF)
  scene prior and using a secondary NeRF to represent the corruptions over which we
  place an uninformative prior. RIG, trained only on clean data, outperforms depth
  estimators and alternative NeRF approaches that perform point estimation instead
  of full inference. The results hold for a number of scene prior architectures based
  on normalizing flows and diffusion models. For the latter, we develop reconstruction-guidance
  with auxiliary latents (ReGAL)—a diffusion conditioning algorithm that is applicable
  in the presence of auxiliary latent variables such as the corruption. RIG demonstrates
  how scene priors can be used beyond generation tasks.
