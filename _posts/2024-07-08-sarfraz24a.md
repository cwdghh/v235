title: 'Position: Quo Vadis, Unsupervised Time Series Anomaly Detection?'
openreview: W7Vqx1Jvc2
abstract: The current state of machine learning scholarship in Timeseries Anomaly
  Detection (TAD) is plagued by the persistent use of flawed evaluation metrics, inconsistent
  benchmarking practices, and a lack of proper justification for the choices made
  in novel deep learning-based model designs. Our paper presents a critical analysis
  of the status quo in TAD, revealing the misleading track of current research and
  highlighting problematic methods, and evaluation practices. <b><em>Our position
  advocates for a shift in focus from solely pursuing novel model designs to improving
  benchmarking practices, creating non-trivial datasets, and critically evaluating
  the utility of complex methods against simpler baselines</em></b>. Our findings
  demonstrate the need for rigorous evaluation protocols, the creation of simple baselines,
  and the revelation that state-of-the-art deep anomaly detection models effectively
  learn linear mappings. These findings suggest the need for more exploration and
  development of simple and interpretable TAD methods. The increment of model complexity
  in the state-of-the-art deep-learning based models unfortunately offers very little
  improvement. We offer insights and suggestions for the field to move forward.
