title: 'Slot Abstractors: Toward Scalable Abstract Visual Reasoning'
openreview: duyl8sy8qV
abstract: Abstract visual reasoning is a characteristically human ability, allowing
  the identification of relational patterns that are abstracted away from object features,
  and the systematic generalization of those patterns to unseen problems. Recent work
  has demonstrated strong systematic generalization in visual reasoning tasks involving
  multi-object inputs, through the integration of slot-based methods used for extracting
  object-centric representations coupled with strong inductive biases for relational
  abstraction. However, this approach was limited to problems containing a single
  rule, and was not scalable to visual reasoning problems containing a large number
  of objects. Other recent work proposed Abstractors, an extension of Transformers
  that incorporates strong relational inductive biases, thereby inheriting the Transformerâ€™s
  scalability and multi-head architecture, but it has yet to be demonstrated how this
  approach might be applied to multi-object visual inputs. Here we combine the strengths
  of the above approaches and propose Slot Abstractors, an approach to abstract visual
  reasoning that can be scaled to problems involving a large number of objects and
  multiple relations among them. The approach displays state-of-the-art performance
  across four abstract visual reasoning tasks, as well as an abstract reasoning task
  involving real-world images.
