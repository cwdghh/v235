title: Unsupervised Concept Discovery Mitigates Spurious Correlations
openreview: lQzmDFlsHX
abstract: 'Models prone to spurious correlations in training data often produce brittle
  predictions and introduce unintended biases. Addressing this challenge typically
  involves methods relying on prior knowledge and group annotation to remove spurious
  correlations, which may not be readily available in many applications. In this paper,
  we establish a novel connection between unsupervised object-centric learning and
  mitigation of spurious correlations. Instead of directly inferring subgroups with
  varying correlations with labels, our approach focuses on discovering concepts:
  discrete ideas that are shared across input samples. Leveraging existing object-centric
  representation learning, we introduce CoBalT: a concept balancing technique that
  effectively mitigates spurious correlations without requiring human labeling of
  subgroups. Evaluation across the benchmark datasets for sub-population shifts demonstrate
  superior or competitive performance compared state-of-the-art baselines, without
  the need for group annotation. Code is available at https://github.com/rarefin/CoBalT'
