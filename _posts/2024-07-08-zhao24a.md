title: 'Position: Measure Dataset Diversity, Don’t Just Claim It'
openreview: jsKr6RVDDs
abstract: Machine learning (ML) datasets, often perceived as neutral, inherently encapsulate
  abstract and disputed social constructs. Dataset curators frequently employ value-laden
  terms such as diversity, bias, and quality to characterize datasets. Despite their
  prevalence, these terms lack clear definitions and validation. Our research explores
  the implications of this issue by analyzing "diversity" across 135 image and text
  datasets. Drawing from social sciences, we apply principles from measurement theory
  to identify considerations and offer recommendations for conceptualizing, operationalizing,
  and evaluating diversity in datasets. Our findings have broader implications for
  ML research, advocating for a more nuanced and precise approach to handling value-laden
  properties in dataset construction.
