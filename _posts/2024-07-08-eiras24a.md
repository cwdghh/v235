title: Efficient Error Certification for Physics-Informed Neural Networks
openreview: 5t4V7Q6lmz
abstract: 'Recent work provides promising evidence that Physics-Informed Neural Networks
  (PINN) can efficiently solve partial differential equations (PDE). However, previous
  works have failed to provide guarantees on the <em>worst-case</em> residual error
  of a PINN across the spatio-temporal domain - a measure akin to the tolerance of
  numerical solvers - focusing instead on point-wise comparisons between their solution
  and the ones obtained by a solver on a set of inputs. In real-world applications,
  one cannot consider tests on a finite set of points to be sufficient grounds for
  deployment, as the performance could be substantially worse on a different set.
  To alleviate this issue, we establish guaranteed error-based conditions for PINNs
  over their <em>continuous</em> applicability domain. To verify the extent to which
  they hold, we introduce $\partial$-CROWN: a general, efficient and scalable post-training
  framework to bound PINN residual errors. We demonstrate its effectiveness in obtaining
  tight certificates by applying it to two classically studied PINNs – Burgers’ and
  Schrödinger’s equations –, and two more challenging ones with real-world applications
  – the Allan-Cahn and Diffusion-Sorption equations.'
