title: Efficient PAC Learnability of Dynamical Systems Over Multilayer Networks
openreview: 2PVjIQdq7N
abstract: Networked dynamical systems are widely used as formal models of real-world
  cascading phenomena, such as the spread of diseases and information. Prior research
  has addressed the problem of learning the behavior of an unknown dynamical system
  when the underlying network has a single layer. In this work, we study the learnability
  of dynamical systems over multilayer networks, which are more realistic and challenging.
  First, we present an efficient PAC learning algorithm with provable guarantees to
  show that the learner only requires a small number of training examples to infer
  an unknown system. We further provide a tight analysis of the Natarajan dimension
  which measures the model complexity. Asymptotically, our bound on the Nararajan
  dimension is tight for almost all multilayer graphs. The techniques and insights
  from our work provide the theoretical foundations for future investigations of learning
  problems for multilayer dynamical systems.
