title: Inverse-Variance Weighting for Estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects
openreview: TUKOklS3gg
abstract: Many methods for estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATEs)
  can be expressed as weighted pseudo-outcome regressions (PORs). Previous comparisons
  of POR techniques have paid careful attention to the choice of pseudo-outcome transformation.
  However, we argue that the dominant driver of performance is actually the choice
  of weights. For example, we point out that R-Learning implicitly performs a POR
  with inverse-variance weights (IVWs). In the CATE setting, IVWs mitigate the instability
  associated with inverse-propensity weights, and lead to convenient simplifications
  of bias terms. We demonstrate the superior performance of IVWs in simulations, and
  derive convergence rates for IVWs that are, to our knowledge, the fastest yet shown
  without assuming knowledge of the covariate distribution.
