title: 'Prompting4Debugging: Red-Teaming Text-to-Image Diffusion Models by Finding
  Problematic Prompts'
openreview: VyGo1S5A6d
abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, e.g. Stable Diffusion (SD), lately have
  shown remarkable ability in high-quality content generation, and become one of the
  representatives for the recent wave of transformative AI. Nevertheless, such advance
  comes with an intensifying concern about the misuse of this generative technology,
  especially for producing copyrighted or NSFW (i.e. not safe for work) images. Although
  efforts have been made to filter inappropriate images/prompts or remove undesirable
  concepts/styles via model fine-tuning, the reliability of these safety mechanisms
  against diversified problematic prompts remains largely unexplored. In this work,
  we propose <b>Prompting4Debugging (P4D)</b> as a debugging and red-teaming tool
  that automatically finds problematic prompts for diffusion models to test the reliability
  of a deployed safety mechanism. We demonstrate the efficacy of our P4D tool in uncovering
  new vulnerabilities of SD models with safety mechanisms. Particularly, our result
  shows that around half of prompts in existing safe prompting benchmarks which were
  originally considered "safe" can actually be manipulated to bypass many deployed
  safety mechanisms, including concept removal, negative prompt, and safety guidance.
  Our findings suggest that, without comprehensive testing, the evaluations on limited
  safe prompting benchmarks can lead to a false sense of safety for text-to-image
  models.
