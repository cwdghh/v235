title: Towards Neural Architecture Search through Hierarchical Generative Modeling
openreview: VdZfEMuoj2
abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to automate deep neural network design
  across various applications, while a good search space design is core to NAS performance.
  A too-narrow search space may fail to cover diverse task requirements, whereas a
  too-broad one can escalate computational expenses and reduce efficiency. %We propose
  automatically generating the search space to tailor it to specific task conditions,
  optimizing search costs and producing viable architectures. In this work, we aim
  to address this challenge by leaning on the recent advances in generative modelling
  – we propose a novel method that can navigate through an extremely large, general-purpose
  initial search space efficiently by training a two-level generative model hierarchy.
  The first level uses Conditional Continuous Normalizing Flow (CCNF) for micro-cell
  design, while the second employs a transformer-based sequence generator to craft
  macro architectures aligned with task needs and architectural constraints. To ensure
  computational feasibility, we pretrain the generative models in a task-agnostic
  manner using a metric space of graph and zero-cost (ZC) similarities between architectures.
  We show our approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance among other low-cost
  NAS methods across different tasks on CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet and NAS-Bench-360.
