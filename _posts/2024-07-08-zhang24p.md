title: 'MILP-FBGen: LP/MILP Instance Generation with Feasibility/Boundedness'
openreview: j4HtfTqr0f
abstract: 'Machine learning (ML) has been actively adopted in Linear Programming (LP)
  and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), whose potential is hindered by instance
  scarcity. Current synthetic instance generation methods often fall short in closely
  mirroring the distribution of original datasets or ensuring the feasibility and
  boundedness of the generated data â€” a critical requirement for obtaining reliable
  supervised labels in model training. In this paper, we present a diffusion-based
  LP/MILP instance generative framework called MILP-FBGen. It strikes a balance between
  structural similarity and novelty while maintaining feasibility/boundedness via
  a meticulously designed structure-preserving generation module and a feasibility/boundedness-constrained
  sampling module. Our method shows superiority on two fronts: 1) preservation of
  key properties (hardness, feasibility, and boundedness) of LP/MILP instances, and
  2) enhanced performance on downstream tasks. Extensive studies show two-fold superiority
  that our method ensures higher distributional similarity and 100% feasibility in
  both easy and hard datasets, surpassing current state-of-the-art techniques.'
