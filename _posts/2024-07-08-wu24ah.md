title: 'Q-Align: Teaching LMMs for Visual Scoring via Discrete Text-Defined Levels'
openreview: PHjkVjR78A
abstract: The explosion of visual content available online underscores the requirement
  for an accurate machine assessor to robustly evaluate scores across diverse types
  of visual contents. While recent studies have demonstrated the exceptional potentials
  of large multi-modality models (LMMs) on a wide range of related fields, in this
  work, we explore how to teach them for visual rating aligning with human opinions.
  Observing that human raters only learn and judge discrete text-defined levels in
  subjective studies, we propose to emulate this subjective process and teach LMMs
  with text-defined rating levels instead of scores. The proposed Q-Align achieves
  state-of-the-art accuracy on image quality assessment (IQA), image aesthetic assessment
  (IAA), as well as video quality assessment (VQA) under the original LMM structure.
  With the syllabus, we further unify the three tasks into one model, termed the OneAlign.
  Our experiments demonstrate the advantage of discrete levels over direct scores
  on training, and that LMMs can learn beyond the discrete levels and provide effective
  finer-grained evaluations. Code and weights will be released.
