title: Optimization without Retraction on the Random Generalized Stiefel Manifold
openreview: QLtxj3erlJ
abstract: Optimization over the set of matrices $X$ that satisfy $X^\top B X = I_p$,
  referred to as the generalized Stiefel manifold, appears in many applications involving
  sampled covariance matrices such as the canonical correlation analysis (CCA), independent
  component analysis (ICA), and the generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP). Solving
  these problems is typically done by iterative methods that require a fully formed
  $B$. We propose a cheap stochastic iterative method that solves the optimization
  problem while having access only to a random estimates of $B$. Our method does not
  enforce the constraint in every iteration; instead, it produces iterations that
  converge to critical points on the generalized Stiefel manifold defined in expectation.
  The method has lower per-iteration cost, requires only matrix multiplications, and
  has the same convergence rates as its Riemannian optimization counterparts that
  require the full matrix $B$. Experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in various
  machine learning applications involving generalized orthogonality constraints, including
  CCA, ICA, and the GEVP.
