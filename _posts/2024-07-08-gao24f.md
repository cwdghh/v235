title: 'Linear Alignment: A Closed-form Solution for Aligning Human Preferences without
  Tuning and Feedback'
openreview: Y4wxCICbD0
abstract: The success of AI assistants based on Language Models (LLMs) hinges on Reinforcement
  Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to comprehend and align with user intentions.
  However, traditional alignment algorithms, such as PPO, are hampered by complex
  annotation and training requirements. This reliance limits the applicability of
  RLHF and hinders the development of professional assistants tailored to diverse
  human preferences. In this work, we introduce <em>Linear Alignment</em>, a novel
  algorithm that aligns language models with human preferences in one single inference
  step, eliminating the reliance on data annotation and model training. Linear alignment
  incorporates a new parameterization for policy optimization under divergence constraints,
  which enables the extraction of optimal policy in a closed-form manner and facilitates
  the direct estimation of the aligned response. Extensive experiments on both general
  and personalized preference datasets demonstrate that linear alignment significantly
  enhances the performance and efficiency of LLM alignment across diverse scenarios.
