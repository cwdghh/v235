title: 'Think Before You Act: Decision Transformers with Working Memory'
openreview: PSQ5Z920M8
abstract: Decision Transformer-based decision-making agents have shown the ability
  to generalize across multiple tasks. However, their performance relies on massive
  data and computation. We argue that this inefficiency stems from the forgetting
  phenomenon, in which a model memorizes its behaviors in parameters throughout training.
  As a result, training on a new task may deteriorate the model’s performance on previous
  tasks. In contrast to LLMs’ implicit memory mechanism, the human brain utilizes
  distributed memory storage, which helps manage and organize multiple skills efficiently,
  mitigating the forgetting phenomenon. Inspired by this, we propose a working memory
  module to store, blend, and retrieve information for different downstream tasks.
  Evaluation results show that the proposed method improves training efficiency and
  generalization in Atari games and Meta-World object manipulation tasks. Moreover,
  we demonstrate that memory fine-tuning further enhances the adaptability of the
  proposed architecture.
