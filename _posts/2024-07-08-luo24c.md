title: Unveiling the Cycloid Trajectory of EM Iterations in Mixed Linear Regression
openreview: Yn8xnK90mS
abstract: We study the trajectory of iterations and the convergence rates of the Expectation-Maximization
  (EM) algorithm for two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR). The fundamental
  goal of MLR is to learn the regression models from unlabeled observations. The EM
  algorithm finds extensive applications in solving the mixture of linear regressions.
  Recent results have established the super-linear convergence of EM for 2MLR in the
  noiseless and high SNR settings under some assumptions and its global convergence
  rate with random initialization has been affirmed. However, the exponent of convergence
  has not been theoretically estimated and the geometric properties of the trajectory
  of EM iterations are not well-understood. In this paper, first, using Bessel functions
  we provide explicit closed-form expressions for the EM updates under all SNR regimes.
  Then, in the noiseless setting, we completely characterize the behavior of EM iterations
  by deriving a recurrence relation at the population level and notably show that
  all the iterations lie on a certain cycloid. Based on this new trajectory-based
  analysis, we exhibit the theoretical estimate for the exponent of super-linear convergence
  and further improve the statistical error bound at the finite-sample level. Our
  analysis provides a new framework for studying the behavior of EM for Mixed Linear
  Regression.
