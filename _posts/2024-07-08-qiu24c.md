title: To Cool or not to Cool? Temperature Network Meets Large Foundation Models via
  DRO
openreview: YWuSLBkfOw
abstract: 'The temperature parameter plays a profound role during training and/or
  inference with large foundation models (LFMs) such as large language models (LLMs)
  and CLIP models. Particularly, it adjusts the logits in the softmax function in
  LLMs, which is crucial for next token generation, and it scales the similarities
  in the contrastive loss for training CLIP models. A significant question remains:
  â€œ Is it viable to learn a neural network to predict a personalized temperature of
  any input data for enhancing LFMs?" In this paper, we present a principled framework
  for learning a small yet generalizable temperature prediction network (TempNet)
  to improve LFMs. Our solution is composed of a novel learning framework with robust
  losses underpinned by constrained distributionally robust optimization (DRO), and
  a properly designed TempNet with theoretical inspiration. TempNet can be trained
  together with a large foundation model from scratch or learned separately given
  a pretrained foundation model. It is not only useful for predicting personalized
  temperature to promote the training of LFMs but also generalizable and transferable
  to new tasks. Our experiments on LLMs and CLIP models demonstrate that TempNet greatly
  improves the performance of existing solutions or models.'
