title: Target Networks and Over-parameterization Stabilize Off-policy Bootstrapping
  with Function Approximation
openreview: R6GT1UDcOW
abstract: We prove that the combination of a target network and over-parameterized
  linear function approximation establishes a weaker convergence condition for bootstrapped
  value estimation in certain cases, even with off-policy data. Our condition is naturally
  satisfied for expected updates over the entire state-action space or learning with
  a batch of complete trajectories from episodic Markov decision processes. Notably,
  using only a target network or an over-parameterized model does not provide such
  a convergence guarantee. Additionally, we extend our results to learning with truncated
  trajectories, showing that convergence is achievable for all tasks with minor modifications,
  akin to value truncation for the final states in trajectories. Our primary result
  focuses on temporal difference estimation for prediction, providing high-probability
  value estimation error bounds and empirical analysis on Bairdâ€™s counterexample and
  a Four-room task. Furthermore, we explore the control setting, demonstrating that
  similar convergence conditions apply to Q-learning.
