title: 'Position: Data-driven Discovery with Large Generative Models'
openreview: 5SpjhZNXtt
abstract: With the accumulation of data at an unprecedented rate, its potential to
  fuel scientific discovery is growing exponentially. This position paper urges the
  Machine Learning (ML) community to exploit the capabilities of large generative
  models (LGMs) to develop automated systems for end-to-end data-driven discovery—a
  paradigm encompassing the search and verification of hypotheses purely from a set
  of provided datasets, without the need for additional data collection or physical
  experiments. We first outline several desiderata for an ideal data-driven discovery
  system. Then, through DataVoyager, a proof-of-concept utilizing GPT-4, we demonstrate
  how LGMs fulfill several of these desiderata—a feat previously unattainable—while
  also highlighting important limitations in the current system that open up opportunities
  for novel ML research. We contend that achieving accurate, reliable, and robust
  end-to-end discovery systems solely through the current capabilities of LGMs is
  challenging. We instead advocate for fail-proof tool integration, along with active
  user moderation through feedback mechanisms, to foster data-driven scientific discoveries
  with efficiency and reproducibility.
