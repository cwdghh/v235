title: Decomposing and Editing Predictions by Modeling Model Computation
openreview: rTBR0eqE4G
abstract: <em>How does the internal computation of a machine learning model transform
  inputs into predictions?</em> To tackle this question, we introduce a framework
  called <em>component modeling</em> for decomposing a model prediction in terms of
  its componentsâ€”architectural "building blocks" such as convolution filters or attention
  heads. We focus on a special case of this framework, <em>component attribution</em>,
  where the goal is to estimate the counterfactual impact of individual components
  on a given prediction. We then present COAR, a scalable algorithm for estimating
  component attributions, and demonstrate its effectiveness across models, datasets
  and modalities. Finally, we show that COAR directly enables effective model editing.
  Our code is available at github.com/MadryLab/modelcomponents.
