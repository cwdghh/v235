title: 'SelMatch: Effectively Scaling Up Dataset Distillation via Selection-Based
  Initialization and Partial Updates by Trajectory Matching'
openreview: pTFud6SetK
abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small number of images per class
  (IPC) from a large dataset to approximate full dataset training with minimal performance
  loss. While effective in very small IPC ranges, many distillation methods become
  less effective, even underperforming random sample selection, as IPC increases.
  Our examination of state-of-the-art trajectory-matching based distillation methods
  across various IPC scales reveals that these methods struggle to incorporate the
  complex, rare features of harder samples into the synthetic dataset even with the
  increased IPC, resulting in a persistent coverage gap between easy and hard test
  samples. Motivated by such observations, we introduce SelMatch, a novel distillation
  method that effectively scales with IPC. SelMatch uses selection-based initialization
  and partial updates through trajectory matching to manage the synthetic datasetâ€™s
  desired difficulty level tailored to IPC scales. When tested on CIFAR-10/100 and
  TinyImageNet, SelMatch consistently outperforms leading selection-only and distillation-only
  methods across subset ratios from 5% to 30%.
