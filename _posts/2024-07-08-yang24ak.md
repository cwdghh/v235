title: 'MorphGrower: A Synchronized Layer-by-layer Growing Approach for Plausible
  Neuronal Morphology Generation'
openreview: ZTN866OsGx
abstract: Neuronal morphology is essential for studying brain functioning and understanding
  neurodegenerative disorders. As acquiring real-world morphology data is expensive,
  computational approaches for morphology generation have been studied. Traditional
  methods heavily rely on expert-set rules and parameter tuning, making it difficult
  to generalize across different types of morphologies. Recently, MorphVAE was introduced
  as the sole learning-based method, but its generated morphologies lack plausibility,
  i.e., they do not appear realistic enough and most of the generated samples are
  topologically invalid. To fill this gap, this paper proposes <b>MorphGrower</b>,
  which mimicks the neuron natural growth mechanism for generation. Specifically,
  MorphGrower generates morphologies layer by layer, with each subsequent layer conditioned
  on the previously generated structure. During each layer generation, MorphGrower
  utilizes a pair of sibling branches as the basic generation block and generates
  branch pairs synchronously. This approach ensures topological validity and allows
  for fine-grained generation, thereby enhancing the realism of the final generated
  morphologies. Results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MorphGrower outperforms
  MorphVAE by a notable margin. Importantly, the electrophysiological response simulation
  demonstrates the plausibility of our generated samples from a neuroscience perspective.
