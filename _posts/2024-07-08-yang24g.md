title: Latent Space Symmetry Discovery
openreview: qstt2OguvM
abstract: Equivariant neural networks require explicit knowledge of the symmetry group.
  Automatic symmetry discovery methods aim to relax this constraint and learn invariance
  and equivariance from data. However, existing symmetry discovery methods are limited
  to simple linear symmetries and cannot handle the complexity of real-world data.
  We propose a novel generative model, Latent LieGAN (LaLiGAN), which can discover
  symmetries of nonlinear group actions. It learns a mapping from the data space to
  a latent space where the symmetries become linear and simultaneously discovers symmetries
  in the latent space. Theoretically, we show that our model can express nonlinear
  symmetries under some conditions about the group action. Experimentally, we demonstrate
  that our method can accurately discover the intrinsic symmetry in high-dimensional
  dynamical systems. LaLiGAN also results in a well-structured latent space that is
  useful for downstream tasks including equation discovery and long-term forecasting.
