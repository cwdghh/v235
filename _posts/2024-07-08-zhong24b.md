title: Provably Efficient Exploration in Quantum Reinforcement Learning with Logarithmic
  Worst-Case Regret
openreview: eFvoL7BOny
abstract: While quantum reinforcement learning (RL) has attracted a surge of attention
  recently, its theoretical understanding is limited. In particular, it remains elusive
  how to design provably efficient quantum RL algorithms that can address the exploration-exploitation
  trade-off. To this end, we propose a novel UCRL-style algorithm that takes advantage
  of quantum computing for tabular Markov decision processes (MDPs) with $S$ states,
  $A$ actions, and horizon $H$, and establish an $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{poly}(S, A,
  H, \log T))$ worst-case regret for it, where $T$ is the number of episodes. Furthermore,
  we extend our results to quantum RL with linear function approximation, which is
  capable of handling problems with large state spaces. Specifically, we develop a
  quantum algorithm based on value target regression (VTR) for linear mixture MDPs
  with $d$-dimensional linear representation and prove that it enjoys $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{poly}(d,
  H, \log T))$ regret. Our algorithms are variants of UCRL/UCRL-VTR algorithms in
  classical RL, which also leverage a novel combination of lazy updating mechanisms
  and quantum estimation subroutines. This is the key to breaking the $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$-regret
  barrier in classical RL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work studying
  the online exploration in quantum RL with provable logarithmic worst-case regret.
