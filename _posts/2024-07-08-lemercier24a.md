title: An Independence-promoting Loss for Music Generation with Language Models
openreview: CLJZI5kDhX
abstract: 'Music generation schemes using language modeling rely on a vocabulary of
  audio tokens, generally provided as codes in a discrete latent space learnt by an
  auto-encoder. Multi-stage quantizers are often employed to produce these tokens,
  therefore the decoding strategy used for token prediction must be adapted to account
  for multiple codebooks: either it should model the joint distribution over all codebooks,
  or fit the product of the codebook marginal distributions. Modelling the joint distribution
  requires a costly increase in the number of auto-regressive steps, while fitting
  the product of the marginals yields an inexact model unless the codebooks are mutually
  independent. In this work, we introduce an independence-promoting loss to regularize
  the auto-encoder used as the tokenizer in language models for music generation.
  The proposed loss is a proxy for mutual information based on the maximum mean discrepancy
  principle, applied in reproducible kernel Hilbert spaces. Our criterion is simple
  to implement and train, and it is generalizable to other multi-stream codecs. We
  show that it reduces the statistical dependence between codebooks during auto-encoding.
  This leads to an increase in the generated music quality when modelling the product
  of the marginal distributions, while generating audio much faster than the joint
  distribution model.'
