title: 'Pseudo-Calibration: Improving Predictive Uncertainty Estimation in Unsupervised
  Domain Adaptation'
openreview: XnsI1HKAKC
abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has seen substantial efforts to improve
  model accuracy for an unlabeled target domain with the help of a labeled source
  domain. However, UDA models often exhibit poorly calibrated predictive uncertainty
  on target data, a problem that remains under-explored and poses risks in safety-critical
  UDA applications. The calibration problem in UDA is particularly challenging due
  to the absence of labeled target data and severe distribution shifts between domains.
  In this paper, we approach UDA calibration as a target-domain-specific unsupervised
  problem, different from mainstream solutions based on <em>covariate shift</em>.
  We introduce Pseudo-Calibration (PseudoCal), a novel post-hoc calibration framework.
  Our innovative use of inference-stage <em>mixup</em> synthesizes a labeled pseudo-target
  set capturing the structure of the real unlabeled target data. This turns the unsupervised
  calibration problem into a supervised one, easily solvable with <em>temperature
  scaling</em>. Extensive empirical evaluations across 5 diverse UDA scenarios involving
  10 UDA methods consistently demonstrate the superior performance and versatility
  of PseudoCal over existing solutions.
