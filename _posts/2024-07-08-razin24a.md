title: 'Implicit Bias of Policy Gradient in Linear Quadratic Control: Extrapolation
  to Unseen Initial States'
openreview: XT6iF8FDZx
abstract: In modern machine learning, models can often fit training data in numerous
  ways, some of which perform well on unseen (test) data, while others do not. Remarkably,
  in such cases gradient descent frequently exhibits an implicit bias that leads to
  excellent performance on unseen data. This implicit bias was extensively studied
  in supervised learning, but is far less understood in optimal control (reinforcement
  learning). There, learning a controller applied to a system via gradient descent
  is known as policy gradient, and a question of prime importance is the extent to
  which a learned controller extrapolates to unseen initial states. This paper theoretically
  studies the implicit bias of policy gradient in terms of extrapolation to unseen
  initial states. Focusing on the fundamental Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem,
  we establish that the extent of extrapolation depends on the degree of exploration
  induced by the system when commencing from initial states included in training.
  Experiments corroborate our theory, and demonstrate its conclusions on problems
  beyond LQR, where systems are non-linear and controllers are neural networks. We
  hypothesize that real-world optimal control may be greatly improved by developing
  methods for informed selection of initial states to train on.
