title: Online conformal prediction with decaying step sizes
openreview: 2XkRIijUKw
abstract: 'We introduce a method for online conformal prediction with decaying step
  sizes. Like previous methods, ours possesses a retrospective guarantee of coverage
  for arbitrary sequences. However, unlike previous methods, we can simultaneously
  estimate a population quantile when it exists. Our theory and experiments indicate
  substantially improved practical properties: in particular, when the distribution
  is stable, the coverage is close to the desired level <em>for every time point</em>,
  not just on average over the observed sequence.'
