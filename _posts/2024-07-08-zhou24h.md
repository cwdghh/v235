title: Finite-Time Convergence and Sample Complexity of Actor-Critic Multi-Objective
  Reinforcement Learning
openreview: 18rzx2PXKm
abstract: 'Reinforcement learning with multiple, potentially conflicting objectives
  is pervasive in real-world applications, while this problem remains theoretically
  under-explored. This paper tackles the multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL)
  problem and introduces an innovative actor-critic algorithm named MOAC which finds
  a policy by iteratively making trade-offs among conflicting reward signals. Notably,
  we provide the first analysis of finite-time Pareto-stationary convergence and corresponding
  sample complexity in both discounted and average reward settings. Our approach has
  two salient features: (a) MOAC mitigates the cumulative estimation bias resulting
  from finding an optimal common gradient descent direction out of stochastic samples.
  This enables provable convergence rate and sample complexity guarantees independent
  of the number of objectives; (b) With proper momentum coefficient, MOAC initializes
  the weights of individual policy gradients using samples from the environment, instead
  of manual initialization. This enhances the practicality and robustness of our algorithm.
  Finally, experiments conducted on a real-world dataset validate the effectiveness
  of our proposed method.'
