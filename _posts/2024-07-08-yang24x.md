title: 'UniAudio: Towards Universal Audio Generation with Large Language Models'
openreview: SRmZw7nEGW
abstract: Audio generation is a major branch of generative AI research. Compared with
  prior works in this area that are commonly task-specific with heavy domain knowledge,
  this paper advocates building universal audio generation models that can handle
  various tasks in a unified manner. As recent research on large language models (LLMs)
  has demonstrated their strong ability to handle multiple tasks, this work presents
  UniAudio, an LLM-based audio generation model that supports a wide range of audio
  generation tasks. Based on various input conditions, such as phoneme, text description,
  or audio itself, UniAudio can generate speech, sound, music, and singing voice.
  The proposed UniAudio is built with 100k hours of multi-source open-available audio
  data and is scaled to 1B parameters. The audio tokenization method and language
  model architecture are also specifically designed for both performance and efficiency.
  Experimentally, UniAuido supports 11 audio generation tasks and achieves competitive
  results on all tasks consistently. We also show that UniAudio can support new tasks
  seamlessly via simple fine-tuning.
