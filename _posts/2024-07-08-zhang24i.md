title: 'Reshape and Adapt for Output Quantization (RAOQ): Quantization-aware Training
  for In-memory Computing Systems'
openreview: fM9xTkpAdu
abstract: 'In-memory computing (IMC) has emerged as a promising solution to address
  both computation and data-movement challenges, by performing computation on data
  in-place directly in the memory array. IMC typically relies on analog operation,
  which makes analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) necessary, for converting results
  back to the digital domain. However, ADCs maintain computational efficiency by having
  limited precision, leading to substantial quantization errors in compute outputs.
  This work proposes RAOQ (Reshape and Adapt for Output Quantization) to overcome
  this issue, which comprises two classes of mechanisms including: 1) mitigating ADC
  quantization error by adjusting the statistics of activations and weights, through
  an activation-shifting approach (A-shift) and a weight reshaping technique (W-reshape);
  2) adapting AI models to better tolerate ADC quantization through a bit augmentation
  method (BitAug), complemented by the introduction of ADC-LoRA, a low-rank approximation
  technique, to reduce the training overhead. RAOQ demonstrates consistently high
  performance across different scales and domains of neural network models for computer
  vision and natural language processing (NLP) tasks at various bit precisions, achieving
  state-of-the-art results with practical IMC implementations.'
