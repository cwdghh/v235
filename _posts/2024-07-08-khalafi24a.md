title: Neural Tangent Kernels Motivate Cross-Covariance Graphs in Neural Networks
openreview: 61JD8wp4Id
abstract: Neural tangent kernels (NTKs) provide a theoretical regime to analyze the
  learning and generalization behavior of over-parametrized neural networks. For a
  supervised learning task, the association between the eigenvectors of the NTK and
  given data (a concept referred to as alignment in this paper) can govern the rate
  of convergence of gradient descent, as well as generalization to unseen data. Building
  upon this concept and leveraging the structure of NTKs for graph neural networks
  (GNNs), we theoretically investigate NTKs and alignment, where our analysis reveals
  that optimizing the alignment translates to optimizing the graph representation
  or the graph shift operator (GSO) in a GNN. Our results further establish theoretical
  guarantees on the optimality of the alignment for a two-layer GNN and these guarantees
  are characterized by the graph shift operator being a function of the cross-covariance
  between the input and the output data. The theoretical insights drawn from the analysis
  of NTKs are validated by our experiments focused on a multi-variate time series
  prediction task for a publicly available dataset. Specifically, they demonstrate
  that GNN-based learning models that operate on the cross-covariance matrix indeed
  outperform those that operate on the covariance matrix estimated from only the input
  data.
