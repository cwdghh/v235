title: Dynamic Anisotropic Smoothing for Noisy Derivative-Free Optimization
openreview: BrCrnaCYDc
abstract: We propose a novel algorithm that extends the methods of ball smoothing
  and Gaussian smoothing for noisy derivative-free optimization by accounting for
  the heterogeneous curvature of the objective function. The algorithm dynamically
  adapts the shape of the smoothing kernel to approximate the Hessian of the objective
  function around a local optimum. This approach significantly reduces the error in
  estimating the gradient from noisy evaluations through sampling. We demonstrate
  the efficacy of our method through numerical experiments on artificial problems.
  Additionally, we show improved performance when tuning NP-hard combinatorial optimization
  solvers compared to existing state-ofthe-art heuristic derivative-free and Bayesian
  optimization methods.
