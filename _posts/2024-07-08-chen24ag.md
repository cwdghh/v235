title: 'AegisFL: Efficient and Flexible Privacy-Preserving Byzantine-Robust Cross-silo
  Federated Learning'
openreview: PHUAG63Efe
abstract: Privacy attacks and poisoning attacks are two of the thorniest problems
  in federation learning (FL). Homomorphic encryption (HE), which allows certain mathematical
  operations to be done in the ciphertext state, provides a way to solve these two
  problems simultaneously. However, existing Paillier-based and CKKS-based privacy-preserving
  byzantine-robust FL (PBFL) solutions not only suffer from low efficiency but also
  expose the final model to the server. Additionally, these methods are limited to
  one robust aggregation algorithm (AGR) and are therefore vulnerable to AGR-tailored
  poisoning attacks. In this paper, we present AegisFL, an efficient PBLF system that
  provides the flexibility to change the AGR. We first observe that the core of the
  existing advanced AGRs is to calculate the inner products, $L_2$ norms and mean
  values for vectors. Based on this observation, we tailor a packing scheme for PBFL,
  which fits perfectly with RLWE-based fully homomorphic encryption. Under this packing
  scheme, the server only needs to perform one ciphertext multiplication to construct
  any required AGR, while the global model only belongs to honest clients. Finally,
  we conduct extensive experiments on different datasets and adversary settings, which
  also confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our scheme.
