title: 'In-context Vectors: Making In Context Learning More Effective and Controllable
  Through Latent Space Steering'
openreview: dJTChKgv3a
abstract: 'Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate emergent in-context learning capabilities,
  where they adapt to new tasks based on example demonstrations. However, in-context
  learning has seen limited effectiveness in many settings, is difficult to quantitatively
  control and takes up context window space. To overcome these limitations, we propose
  an alternative approach that recasts in-context learning as in-context vectors (ICV).
  Using ICV has two steps. We first use a forward pass on demonstration examples to
  create the in-context vector from the latent embedding of the LLM. This vector captures
  essential information about the intended task. On a new query, instead of adding
  demonstrations to the prompt, we shift the latent states of the LLM using the ICV.
  The ICV approach has several benefits: 1) it enables the LLM to more effectively
  follow the demonstration examples; 2) itâ€™s easy to control by adjusting the magnitude
  of the ICV; 3) it reduces the length of the prompt by removing the in-context demonstrations;
  4) ICV is computationally much more efficient than fine-tuning. We demonstrate that
  ICV achieves better performance compared to standard in-context learning and fine-tuning
  on diverse tasks including safety, style transfer, role-playing and formatting.
  Moreover, we show that we can flexibly teach LLM to simultaneously follow different
  types of instructions by simple vector arithmetics on the corresponding ICVs.'
