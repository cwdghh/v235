title: Compressible Dynamics in Deep Overparameterized Low-Rank Learning & Adaptation
openreview: uDkXoZMzBv
abstract: While overparameterization in machine learning models offers great benefits
  in terms of optimization and generalization, it also leads to increased computational
  requirements as model sizes grow. In this work, we show that by leveraging the inherent
  low-dimensional structures of data and compressible dynamics within the model parameters,
  we can reap the benefits of overparameterization without the computational burdens.
  In practice, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for deep low-rank
  matrix completion as well as fine-tuning language models. Our approach is grounded
  in theoretical findings for deep overparameterized low-rank matrix recovery, where
  we show that the learning dynamics of each weight matrix are confined to an invariant
  low-dimensional subspace. Consequently, we can construct and train compact, highly
  compressed factorizations possessing the same benefits as their overparameterized
  counterparts. In the context of deep matrix completion, our technique substantially
  improves training efficiency while retaining the advantages of overparameterization.
  For language model fine-tuning, we propose a method called "Deep LoRA", which improves
  the existing low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique, leading to reduced overfitting
  and a simplified hyperparameter setup, while maintaining comparable efficiency.
  We validate the effectiveness of Deep LoRA on natural language tasks, particularly
  when fine-tuning with limited data.
