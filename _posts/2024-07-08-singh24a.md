title: Domain Generalisation via Imprecise Learning
openreview: yFUdZfbEme
abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation is challenging because it involves
  not only learning from empirical data, but also deciding among various notions of
  generalisation, e.g. optimise based on the average-case risk, worst-case risk, or
  interpolations thereof. While this decision should in principle be decided by the
  model operator like medical doctors in practice, this information might not always
  be available at training time. This situation leads to arbitrary commitments to
  specific generalisation strategies by machine learners due to these deployment uncertainties.
  We introduce the Imprecise Domain Generalisation framework to mitigate this, featuring
  an imprecise risk optimisation that allows learners to stay imprecise by optimising
  against a continuous spectrum of generalisation strategies during training, and
  a model framework that allows operators to specify their generalisation preference
  at deployment. Our work, supported by theoretical and empirical evidence, showcases
  the benefits of integrating imprecision into domain generalisation.
