title: 'Larimar: Large Language Models with Episodic Memory Control'
openreview: t8mt4YrPsq
abstract: Efficient and accurate updating of knowledge stored in Large Language Models
  (LLMs) is one of the most pressing research challenges today. This paper presents
  Larimar - a novel, brain-inspired architecture for enhancing LLMs with a distributed
  episodic memory. Larimar’s memory allows for dynamic, one-shot updates of knowledge
  without the need for computationally expensive re-training or fine-tuning. Experimental
  results on multiple fact editing benchmarks demonstrate that Larimar attains accuracy
  comparable to most competitive baselines, even in the challenging sequential editing
  setup, but also excels in speed—yielding speed-ups of 8-10x depending on the base
  LLM —as well as flexibility due to the proposed architecture being simple, LLM-agnostic,
  and hence general. We further provide mechanisms for selective fact forgetting,
  information leakage prevention, and input context length generalization with Larimar
  and show their effectiveness. Our code is available at https://github.com/IBM/larimar.
