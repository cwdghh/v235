title: Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Online Continual Learning by Modeling
  Previous Task Interrelations via Pareto Optimization
openreview: olbTrkWo1D
abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a core challenge in continual learning (CL),
  where the models struggle to retain previous knowledge when learning new tasks.
  While existing replay-based CL methods have been proposed to tackle this challenge
  by utilizing a memory buffer to store data from previous tasks, they generally overlook
  the interdependence between previously learned tasks and fail to encapsulate the
  optimally integrated knowledge in previous tasks, leading to sub-optimal performance
  of the previous tasks. Against this issue, we first reformulate replay-based CL
  methods as a unified hierarchical gradient aggregation framework. We then incorporate
  the Pareto optimization to capture the interrelationship among previously learned
  tasks and design a Pareto-Optimized CL algorithm (POCL), which effectively enhances
  the overall performance of past tasks while ensuring the performance of the current
  task. Comprehensive empirical results demonstrate that the proposed POCL outperforms
  current state-of-the-art CL methods across multiple datasets and different settings.
