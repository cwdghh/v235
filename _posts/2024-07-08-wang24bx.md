title: Probabilistic Subgoal Representations for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
openreview: b6AwZauZPV
abstract: In goal-conditioned hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), a high-level
  policy specifies a subgoal for the low-level policy to reach. Effective HRL hinges
  on a suitable subgoal representation function, abstracting state space into latent
  subgoal space and inducing varied low-level behaviors. Existing methods adopt a
  subgoal representation that provides a deterministic mapping from state space to
  latent subgoal space. Instead, this paper utilizes Gaussian Processes (GPs) for
  the first probabilistic subgoal representation. Our method employs a GP prior on
  the latent subgoal space to learn a posterior distribution over the subgoal representation
  functions while exploiting the long-range correlation in the state space through
  learnable kernels. This enables an adaptive memory that integrates long-range subgoal
  information from prior planning steps allowing to cope with stochastic uncertainties.
  Furthermore, we propose a novel learning objective to facilitate the simultaneous
  learning of probabilistic subgoal representations and policies within a unified
  framework. In experiments, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
  standard benchmarks but also in environments with stochastic elements and under
  diverse reward conditions. Additionally, our model shows promising capabilities
  in transferring low-level policies across different tasks.
