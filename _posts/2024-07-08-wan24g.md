title: 'S3GCL: Spectral, Swift, Spatial Graph Contrastive Learning'
openreview: znKAWRZSF9
abstract: 'Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a highly effective self-supervised
  approach in graph representation learning. However, prevailing GCL methods confront
  two primary challenges: 1) They predominantly operate under homophily assumptions,
  focusing on low-frequency signals in node features while neglecting heterophilic
  edges that connect nodes with dissimilar features. 2) Their reliance on neighborhood
  aggregation for inference leads to scalability challenges and hinders deployment
  in real-time applications. In this paper, we introduce S3GCL, an innovative framework
  designed to tackle these challenges. Inspired by spectral GNNs, we initially demonstrate
  the correlation between frequency and homophily levels. Then, we propose a novel
  cosine-parameterized Chebyshev polynomial as low/high-pass filters to generate biased
  graph views. To resolve the inference dilemma, we incorporate an MLP encoder and
  enhance its awareness of graph context by introducing structurally and semantically
  neighboring nodes as positive pairs in the spatial domain. Finally, we formulate
  a cross-pass GCL objective between full-pass MLP and biased-pass GNN filtered features,
  eliminating the need for augmentation. Extensive experiments on real-world tasks
  validate S3GCL proficiency in generalization to diverse homophily levels and its
  superior inference efficiency.'
