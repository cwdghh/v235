title: 'Offline Inverse RL: New Solution Concepts and Provably Efficient Algorithms'
openreview: 23tMOWscus
abstract: "<em>Inverse reinforcement learning</em> (IRL) aims to recover the reward
  function of an <em>expert</em> agent from demonstrations of behavior. It is well-known
  that the IRL problem is fundamentally ill-posed, i.e., many reward functions can
  explain the demonstrations. For this reason, IRL has been recently reframed in terms
  of estimating the <em>feasible reward set</em> (Metelli et al., 2021), thus, postponing
  the selection of a single reward. However, so far, the available formulations and
  algorithmic solutions have been proposed and analyzed mainly for the <em>online</em>
  setting, where the learner can interact with the environment and query the expert
  at will. This is clearly unrealistic in most practical applications, where the availability
  of an <em>offline</em> dataset is a much more common scenario. In this paper, we
  introduce a novel notion of feasible reward set capturing the opportunities and
  limitations of the offline setting and we analyze the complexity of its estimation.
  This requires the introduction an original learning framework that copes with the
  intrinsic difficulty of the setting, for which data coverage is not under control.
  Then, we propose two computationally and statistically efficient algorithms, IRLO
  and PIRLO, for addressing the problem. In particular, the latter adopts a specific
  form of <em>pessimism</em> to enforce the novel, desirable property of <em>inclusion
  monotonicity</em> of the delivered feasible set. With this work, we aim to provide
  a panorama of the challenges of the offline IRL problem and how they can be fruitfully
  addressed."
