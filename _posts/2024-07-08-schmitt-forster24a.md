title: Regularized Q-learning through Robust Averaging
openreview: 07f24ya6eX
abstract: We propose a new Q-learning variant, called 2RA Q-learning, that addresses
  some weaknesses of existing Q-learning methods in a principled manner. One such
  weakness is an underlying estimation bias which cannot be controlled and often results
  in poor performance. We propose a distributionally robust estimator for the maximum
  expected value term, which allows us to precisely control the level of estimation
  bias introduced. The distributionally robust estimator admits a closed-form solution
  such that the proposed algorithm has a computational cost per iteration comparable
  to Watkins’ Q-learning. For the tabular case, we show that 2RA Q-learning converges
  to the optimal policy and analyze its asymptotic mean-squared error. Lastly, we
  conduct numerical experiments for various settings, which corroborate our theoretical
  findings and indicate that 2RA Q-learning often performs better than existing methods.
