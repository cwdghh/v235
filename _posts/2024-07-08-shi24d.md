title: Sample-Efficient Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in the Face of Environmental
  Uncertainty
openreview: qDw4FxMubj
abstract: To overcome the sim-to-real gap in reinforcement learning (RL), learned
  policies must maintain robustness against environmental uncertainties. While robust
  RL has been widely studied in single-agent regimes, in multi-agent environments,
  the problem remains understudiedâ€”despite the fact that the problems posed by environmental
  uncertainties are often exacerbated by strategic interactions. This work focuses
  on learning in distributionally robust Markov games (RMGs), a robust variant of
  standard Markov games, wherein each agent aims to learn a policy that maximizes
  its own worst-case performance when the deployed environment deviates within its
  own prescribed uncertainty set. This results in a set of robust equilibrium strategies
  for all agents that align with classic notions of game-theoretic equilibria. Assuming
  a non-adaptive sampling mechanism from a generative model, we propose a sample-efficient
  model-based algorithm (DRNVI) with finite-sample complexity guarantees for learning
  robust variants of various notions of game-theoretic equilibria. We also establish
  an information-theoretic lower bound for solving RMGs, which confirms the near-optimal
  sample complexity of DRNVI with respect to problem-dependent factors such as the
  size of the state space, the target accuracy, and the horizon length.
