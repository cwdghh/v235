title: 'Curated LLM: Synergy of LLMs and Data Curation for tabular augmentation in
  low-data regimes'
openreview: 9cG1oRnqNd
abstract: Machine Learning (ML) in low-data settings remains an underappreciated yet
  crucial problem. Hence, data augmentation methods to increase the sample size of
  datasets needed for ML are key to unlocking the transformative potential of ML in
  data-deprived regions and domains. Unfortunately, the limited training set constrains
  traditional tabular synthetic data generators in their ability to generate a large
  and diverse augmented dataset needed for ML tasks. To address this challenge, we
  introduce $\texttt{CLLM}$, which leverages the prior knowledge of Large Language
  Models (LLMs) for data augmentation in the low-data regime. However, not all the
  data generated by LLMs will improve downstream utility, as for any generative model.
  Consequently, we introduce a principled curation mechanism, leveraging learning
  dynamics, coupled with confidence and uncertainty metrics, to obtain a high-quality
  dataset. Empirically, on multiple real-world datasets, we demonstrate the superior
  performance of $\texttt{CLLM}$ in the low-data regime compared to conventional generators.
  Additionally, we provide insights into the LLM generation and curation mechanism,
  shedding light on the features that enable them to output high-quality augmented
  datasets.
