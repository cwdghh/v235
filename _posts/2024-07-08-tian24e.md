title: 'Towards the Theory of Unsupervised Federated Learning: Non-asymptotic Analysis
  of Federated EM Algorithms'
openreview: kVgpa1rfLO
abstract: While supervised federated learning approaches have enjoyed significant
  success, the domain of unsupervised federated learning remains relatively underexplored.
  Several federated EM algorithms have gained popularity in practice, however, their
  theoretical foundations are often lacking. In this paper, we first introduce a federated
  gradient EM algorithm (FedGrEM) designed for the unsupervised learning of mixture
  models, which supplements the existing federated EM algorithms by considering task
  heterogeneity and potential adversarial attacks. We present a comprehensive finite-sample
  theory that holds for general mixture models, then apply this general theory on
  specific statistical models to characterize the explicit estimation error of model
  parameters and mixture proportions. Our theory elucidates when and how FedGrEM outperforms
  local single-task learning with insights extending to existing federated EM algorithms.
  This bridges the gap between their practical success and theoretical understanding.
  Our numerical results validate our theory, and demonstrate FedGrEMâ€™s superiority
  over existing unsupervised federated learning benchmarks.
