title: Listwise Reward Estimation for Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning
openreview: If6Q9OYfoJ
abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (RL), designing precise reward functions remains
  to be a challenge, particularly when aligning with human intent. Preference-based
  RL (PbRL) was introduced to address this problem by learning reward models from
  human feedback. However, existing PbRL methods have limitations as they often overlook
  the <em>second-order</em> preference that indicates the relative strength of preference.
  In this paper, we propose Listwise Reward Estimation (LiRE), a novel approach for
  offline PbRL that leverages second-order preference information by constructing
  a Ranked List of Trajectories (RLT), which can be efficiently built by using the
  same ternary feedback type as traditional methods. To validate the effectiveness
  of LiRE, we propose a new offline PbRL dataset that objectively reflects the effect
  of the estimated rewards. Our extensive experiments on the dataset demonstrate the
  superiority of LiRE, <em>i.e.,</em> outperforming state-of-the-art baselines even
  with modest feedback budgets and enjoying robustness with respect to the number
  of feedbacks and feedback noise. Our code is available at https://github.com/chwoong/LiRE
