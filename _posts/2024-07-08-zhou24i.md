title: Attack-free Evaluating and Enhancing Adversarial Robustness on Categorical
  Data
openreview: 8ERo4jph0A
abstract: Research on adversarial robustness has predominantly focused on continuous
  inputs, leaving categorical inputs, especially tabular attributes, less examined.
  To echo this challenge, our work aims to evaluate and enhance the robustness of
  classification over categorical attributes against adversarial perturbations through
  efficient attack-free approaches. We propose a robustness evaluation metric named
  Integrated Gradient-Smoothed Gradient (IGSG). It is designed to evaluate the attributional
  sensitivity of each feature and the decision boundary of the classifier, two aspects
  that significantly influence adversarial risk, according to our theoretical analysis.
  Leveraging this metric, we develop an IGSG-based regularization to reduce adversarial
  risk by suppressing the sensitivity of categorical attributes. We conduct extensive
  empirical studies over categorical datasets of various application domains. The
  results affirm the efficacy of both IGSG and IGSG-based regularization. Notably,
  IGSG-based regularization surpasses the state-of-the-art robust training methods
  by a margin of approximately 0.4% to 12.2% on average in terms of adversarial accuracy,
  especially on high-dimension datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/YujunZhou/IGSG.
