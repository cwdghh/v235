title: Membership Inference Attacks on Diffusion Models via Quantile Regression
openreview: xqqccG7gf1
abstract: Recently, diffusion models have become popular tools for image synthesis
  due to their high-quality outputs. However, like other large models, they may leak
  private information about their training data. Here, we demonstrate a privacy vulnerability
  of diffusion models through a <em>membership inference (MI) attack</em>, which aims
  to identify whether a target example belongs to the training set when given the
  trained diffusion model. Our proposed MI attack learns quantile regression models
  that predict (a quantile of) the distribution of reconstruction loss on examples
  not used in training. This allows us to define a granular hypothesis test for determining
  the membership of a point in the training set, based on thresholding the reconstruction
  loss of that point using a custom threshold tailored to the example. We also provide
  a simple bootstrap technique that takes a majority membership prediction over ”a
  bag of weak attackers” which improves the accuracy over individual quantile regression
  models. We show that our attack outperforms the prior state-of-the-art attack while
  being substantially less computationally expensive — prior attacks required training
  multiple ”shadow models” with the same architecture as the model under attack, whereas
  our attack requires training only much smaller models.
