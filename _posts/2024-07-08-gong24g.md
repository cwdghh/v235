title: 'E$^2$GAN: Efficient Training of Efficient GANs for Image-to-Image Translation'
openreview: lrPrkWXqzd
abstract: 'One highly promising direction for enabling flexible real-time on-device
  image editing is utilizing data distillation by leveraging large-scale text-to-image
  diffusion models to generate paired datasets used for training generative adversarial
  networks (GANs). This approach notably alleviates the stringent requirements typically
  imposed by high-end commercial GPUs for performing image editing with diffusion
  models. However, unlike text-to-image diffusion models, each distilled GAN is specialized
  for a specific image editing task, necessitating costly training efforts to obtain
  models for various concepts. In this work, we introduce and address a novel research
  direction: can the process of distilling GANs from diffusion models be made significantly
  more efficient? To achieve this goal, we propose a series of innovative techniques.
  First, we construct a base GAN model with generalized features, adaptable to different
  concepts through fine-tuning, eliminating the need for training from scratch. Second,
  we identify crucial layers within the base GAN model and employ Low-Rank Adaptation
  (LoRA) with a simple yet effective rank search process, rather than fine-tuning
  the entire base model. Third, we investigate the minimal amount of data necessary
  for fine-tuning, further reducing the overall training time. Extensive experiments
  show that we can efficiently empower GANs with the ability to perform real-time
  high-quality image editing on mobile devices with remarkably reduced training and
  storage costs for each concept.'
