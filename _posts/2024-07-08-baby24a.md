title: 'Online Matrix Completion: A Collaborative Approach with Hott Items'
openreview: 7XZKzQtooN
abstract: We investigate the low rank matrix completion problem in an online setting
  with ${M}$ users, ${N}$ items, ${T}$ rounds, and an unknown rank-$r$ reward matrix
  ${R}\in \mathbb{R}^{{M}\times {N}}$. This problem has been well-studied in the literature
  and has several applications in practice. In each round, we recommend ${S}$ carefully
  chosen distinct items to every user and observe noisy rewards. In the regime where
  ${M},{N} >> {T}$, we propose two distinct computationally efficient algorithms for
  recommending items to users and analyze them under the benign <em>hott items</em>
  assumption 1) First, for ${S}=1$, under additional incoherence/smoothness assumptions
  on ${R}$, we propose the phased algorithm PhasedClusterElim. Our algorithm obtains
  a near-optimal per-user regret of $\tilde{O}({N}{M}^{-1}(\Delta^{-1}+\Delta_{\text{hott}}^{-2}))$
  where $\Delta_{\text{hott}},\Delta$ are problem-dependent gap parameters with $\Delta_{\text{hott}}
  >> \Delta$ almost always. 2) Second, we consider a simplified setting with ${S}=r$
  where we make significantly milder assumptions on ${R}$. Here, we introduce another
  phased algorithm, DeterminantElim, to derive a regret guarantee of $\tilde{O}({N}{M}^{-1/r}\Delta_\text{det}^{-1}))$
  where $\Delta_{\text{det}}$ is another problem-dependent gap. Both algorithms crucially
  use collaboration among users to jointly eliminate sub-optimal items for groups
  of users successively in phases, but with distinctive and novel approaches.
