title: 'Position: Opportunities Exist for Machine Learning in Magnetic Fusion Energy'
openreview: arwP5FA2dO
abstract: 'Magnetic confinement fusion may one day provide reliable, carbon-free energy,
  but the field currently faces technical hurdles. In this position paper, we highlight
  six key research challenges in the field of fusion energy that we believe should
  be research priorities for the Machine Learning (ML) community because they are
  especially ripe for ML applications: (1) disruption prediction, (2) simulation and
  dynamics modeling (3) resolving partially observed data, (4) improving controls,
  (5) guiding experiments with optimal design, and (6) enhancing materials discovery.
  For each problem, we give background, review past ML work, suggest features of future
  models, and list challenges and idiosyncrasies facing ML development. We also discuss
  ongoing efforts to update the fusion data ecosystem and identify opportunities further
  down the line that will be enabled as fusion and its data infrastructure advance.
  It is our position that fusion energy offers especially exciting opportunities for
  ML practitioners to impact decarbonization and the future of energy.'
