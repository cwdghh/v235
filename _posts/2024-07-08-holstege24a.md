title: Removing Spurious Concepts from Neural Network Representations via Joint Subspace
  Estimation
openreview: L4ERlHrJRT
abstract: An important challenge in the field of interpretable machine learning is
  to ensure that deep neural networks (DNNs) use the correct or desirable input features
  in performing their tasks. Concept-removal methods aim to do this by eliminating
  concepts that are spuriously correlated with the main task from the neural network
  representation of the data. However, existing methods tend to be overzealous by
  inadvertently removing part of the correct or desirable features as well, leading
  to wrong interpretations and hurting model performance. We propose an iterative
  algorithm that separates spurious from main-task concepts by jointly estimating
  two low-dimensional orthogonal subspaces of the neural network representation. By
  evaluating the algorithm on benchmark datasets from computer vision (Waterbirds,
  CelebA) and natural language processing (MultiNLI), we show it outperforms existing
  concept-removal methods in terms of identifying the main-task and spurious concepts,
  and removing only the latter.
