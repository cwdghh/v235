title: Going beyond Compositions, DDPMs Can Produce Zero-Shot Interpolations
openreview: 1pj0Sk8GfP
abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities
  in image generation, with studies suggesting that they can generalize by composing
  latent factors learned from the training data. In this work, we go further and study
  DDPMs trained on strictly separate subsets of the data distribution with large gaps
  on the support of the latent factors. We show that such a model can effectively
  generate images in the unexplored, intermediate regions of the distribution. For
  instance, when trained on clearly smiling and non-smiling faces, we demonstrate
  a sampling procedure which can generate slightly smiling faces without reference
  images (zero-shot interpolation). We replicate these findings for other attributes
  as well as other datasets. Our code is available on GitHub.
