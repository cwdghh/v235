title: Stochastic Conditional Diffusion Models for Robust Semantic Image Synthesis
openreview: rMV86cAOh6
abstract: Semantic image synthesis (SIS) is a task to generate realistic images corresponding
  to semantic maps (labels). However, in real-world applications, SIS often encounters
  noisy user inputs. To address this, we propose Stochastic Conditional Diffusion
  Model (SCDM), which is a robust conditional diffusion model that features novel
  forward and generation processes tailored for SIS with noisy labels. It enhances
  robustness by stochastically perturbing the semantic label maps through Label Diffusion,
  which diffuses the labels with discrete diffusion. Through the diffusion of labels,
  the noisy and clean semantic maps become similar as the timestep increases, eventually
  becoming identical at $t=T$. This facilitates the generation of an image close to
  a clean image, enabling robust generation. Furthermore, we propose a class-wise
  noise schedule to differentially diffuse the labels depending on the class. We demonstrate
  that the proposed method generates high-quality samples through extensive experiments
  and analyses on benchmark datasets, including a novel experimental setup simulating
  human errors during real-world applications. Code is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/SCDM.
