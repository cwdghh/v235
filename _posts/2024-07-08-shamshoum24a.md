title: DNCs Require More Planning Steps
openreview: tu5fCCuua2
abstract: Many recent works use machine learning models to solve various complex algorithmic
  problems. However, these models attempt to reach a solution without considering
  the problem’s required computational complexity, which can be detrimental to their
  ability to solve it correctly. In this work we investigate the effect of computational
  time and memory on generalization of implicit algorithmic solvers. To do so, we
  focus on the Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC), a general problem solver that
  also lets us reason directly about its usage of time and memory. In this work, we
  argue that the number of planning steps the model is allowed to take, which we call
  ”planning budget”, is a constraint that can cause the model to generalize poorly
  and hurt its ability to fully utilize its external memory. We evaluate our method
  on Graph Shortest Path, Convex Hull, Graph MinCut and Associative Recall, and show
  how the planning budget can drastically change the behavior of the learned algorithm,
  in terms of learned time complexity, training time, stability and generalization
  to inputs larger than those seen during training.
