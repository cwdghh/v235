title: 'FedRC: Tackling Diverse Distribution Shifts Challenge in Federated Learning
  by Robust Clustering'
openreview: kc4dZYJlJG
abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that safeguards privacy
  by retaining client data on edge devices. However, optimizing FL in practice can
  be challenging due to the diverse and heterogeneous nature of the learning system.
  Though recent research has focused on improving the optimization of FL when distribution
  shifts occur among clients, ensuring global performance when multiple types of distribution
  shifts occur simultaneously among clients—such as feature distribution shift, label
  distribution shift, and concept shift—remain under-explored. In this paper, we identify
  the learning challenges posed by the simultaneous occurrence of diverse distribution
  shifts and propose a clustering principle to overcome these challenges. Through
  our research, we find that existing methods fail to address the clustering principle.
  Therefore, we propose a novel clustering algorithm framework, dubbed as FedRC, which
  adheres to our proposed clustering principle by incorporating a bi-level optimization
  problem and a novel objective function. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedRC
  significantly outperforms other SOTA cluster-based FL methods. Our code will be
  publicly available.
