title: Few-Shot Character Understanding in Movies as an Assessment to Meta-Learning
  of Theory-of-Mind
openreview: ZZ7UKgK4c1
abstract: When reading a story, humans can quickly understand new fictional characters
  with a few observations, mainly by drawing analogies to fictional and real people
  they already know. This reflects the few-shot and meta-learning essence of humans’
  inference of characters’ mental states, <em>i.e.</em>, theory-of-mind (ToM), which
  is largely ignored in existing research. We fill this gap with a novel NLP dataset
  in a realistic narrative understanding scenario, ToM-in-AMC. Our dataset consists
  of $\sim$1,000 parsed movie scripts, each corresponding to a few-shot character
  understanding task that requires models to mimic humans’ ability of fast digesting
  characters with a few starting scenes in a new movie. We further propose a novel
  ToM prompting approach designed to explicitly assess the influence of multiple ToM
  dimensions. It surpasses existing baseline models, underscoring the significance
  of modeling multiple ToM dimensions for our task. Our extensive human study verifies
  that humans are capable of solving our problem by inferring characters’ mental states
  based on their previously seen movies. In comparison, all the AI systems lag $>20%$
  behind humans, highlighting a notable limitation in existing approaches’ ToM capabilities.
