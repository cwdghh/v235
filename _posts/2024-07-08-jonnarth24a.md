title: Learning Coverage Paths in Unknown Environments with Deep Reinforcement Learning
openreview: nCZYRBK1J4
abstract: Coverage path planning (CPP) is the problem of finding a path that covers
  the entire free space of a confined area, with applications ranging from robotic
  lawn mowing to search-and-rescue. When the environment is unknown, the path needs
  to be planned online while mapping the environment, which cannot be addressed by
  offline planning methods that do not allow for a flexible path space. We investigate
  how suitable reinforcement learning is for this challenging problem, and analyze
  the involved components required to efficiently learn coverage paths, such as action
  space, input feature representation, neural network architecture, and reward function.
  We propose a computationally feasible egocentric map representation based on frontiers,
  and a novel reward term based on total variation to promote complete coverage. Through
  extensive experiments, we show that our approach surpasses the performance of both
  previous RL-based approaches and highly specialized methods across multiple CPP
  variations.
