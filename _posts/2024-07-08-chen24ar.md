title: A General Framework for Learning from Weak Supervision
openreview: 7sgqXa4aNM
abstract: Weakly supervised learning generally faces challenges in applicability to
  various scenarios with diverse weak supervision and in scalability due to the complexity
  of existing algorithms, thereby hindering the practical deployment. This paper introduces
  a general framework for learning from weak supervision (GLWS) with a novel algorithm.
  Central to GLWS is an Expectation-Maximization (EM) formulation, adeptly accommodating
  various weak supervision sources, including instance partial labels, aggregate statistics,
  pairwise observations, and unlabeled data. We further present an advanced algorithm
  that significantly simplifies the EM computational demands using a Non-deterministic
  Finite Automaton (NFA) along with a forward-backward algorithm, which effectively
  reduces time complexity from quadratic or factorial often required in existing solutions
  to linear scale. The problem of learning from arbitrary weak supervision is therefore
  converted to the NFA modeling of them. GLWS not only enhances the scalability of
  machine learning models but also demonstrates superior performance and versatility
  across 11 weak supervision scenarios. We hope our work paves the way for further
  advancements and practical deployment in this field.
