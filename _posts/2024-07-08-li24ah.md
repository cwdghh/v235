title: Generalizing Knowledge Graph Embedding with Universal Orthogonal Parameterization
openreview: Sv4u9PtvT5
abstract: Recent advances in knowledge graph embedding (KGE) rely on Euclidean/hyperbolic
  orthogonal relation transformations to model intrinsic logical patterns and topological
  structures. However, existing approaches are confined to rigid relational orthogonalization
  with restricted dimension and homogeneous geometry, leading to deficient modeling
  capability. In this work, we move beyond these approaches in terms of both dimension
  and geometry by introducing a powerful framework named GoldE, which features a universal
  orthogonal parameterization based on a generalized form of Householder reflection.
  Such parameterization can naturally achieve dimensional extension and geometric
  unification with theoretical guarantees, enabling our framework to simultaneously
  capture crucial logical patterns and inherent topological heterogeneity of knowledge
  graphs. Empirically, GoldE achieves state-of-the-art performance on three standard
  benchmarks. Codes are available at https://github.com/xxrep/GoldE.
