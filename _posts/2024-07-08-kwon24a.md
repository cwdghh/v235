title: Prospective Side Information for Latent MDPs
openreview: p5FIjG9fbs
abstract: In many interactive decision-making problems, there is contextual side information
  that remains fixed within the course of an interaction. This problem has been studied
  quite extensively under the assumption the context is fully observed, as well as
  in the opposing limit when the context is unobserved, a special type of POMDP also
  referred to as a Latent MDP (LMDP). In this work, we consider a class of decision
  problems that interpolates between the settings, namely, between the case the context
  is fully observed, and the case the context is unobserved. We refer to this class
  of decision problems as <em>LMDPs with prospective side information</em>. In such
  an environment an agent receives additional, weakly revealing, information on the
  latent context at the beginning of each episode. We show that, surprisingly, this
  problem is not captured by contemporary POMDP settings and is not solved by RL algorithms
  designed for partially observed environments. We then establish that any sample
  efficient algorithm must suffer at least $\Omega(K^{2/3})$-regret, as opposed to
  standard $\Omega(\sqrt{K})$ lower bounds. We design an algorithm with a matching
  upper bound that depends only polynomially on the problem parameters. This establishes
  exponential improvement in the sample complexity relative to the existing LMDP lower
  bound, when prospective information is not given in prior work.
