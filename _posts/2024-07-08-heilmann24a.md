title: Differentially Private Sum-Product Networks
openreview: zc3bAEI5lp
abstract: Differentially private ML approaches seek to learn models which may be publicly
  released while guaranteeing that the input data is kept private. One issue with
  this construction is that further model releases based on the same training data
  (e.g. for a new task) incur a further privacy budget cost. Privacy-preserving synthetic
  data generation is one possible solution to this conundrum. However, models trained
  on synthetic private data struggle to approach the performance of private, ad-hoc
  models. In this paper, we present a novel method based on sum-product networks that
  is able to perform both privacy-preserving classification and privacy-preserving
  data generation with a single model. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first
  approach that provides both discriminative and generative capabilities to differentially
  private ML. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms
  of stability (i.e. number of training runs required for convergence) and utility
  of the generated data.
