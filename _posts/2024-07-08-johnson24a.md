title: 'Experts Don’t Cheat: Learning What You Don’t Know By Predicting Pairs'
openreview: AVEc9LvSlO
abstract: 'Identifying how much a model $\hat{p}_{Y|X}^{\theta}$ knows about the stochastic
  real-world process $p_{Y|X}$ it was trained on is important to ensure it avoids
  producing incorrect or "hallucinated" answers or taking unsafe actions. But this
  is difficult for generative models because probabilistic predictions do not distinguish
  between per-response noise (aleatoric uncertainty) and lack of knowledge about the
  process (epistemic uncertainty), and existing epistemic uncertainty quantification
  techniques tend to be overconfident when the model underfits. We propose a general
  strategy for teaching a model to both approximate $p_{Y|X}$ and also estimate the
  remaining gaps between $\hat{p}_{Y|X}^{\theta}$ and $p_{Y|X}$: train it to predict
  <em>pairs</em> of independent responses drawn from the true conditional distribution,
  allow it to "cheat" by observing one response while predicting the other, then measure
  how much it cheats. Remarkably, we prove that being good at cheating (i.e. cheating
  whenever it improves your prediction) is equivalent to being <em>second-order calibrated</em>,
  a principled extension of ordinary calibration that allows us to construct provably-correct
  frequentist confidence intervals for $p_{Y|X}$ and detect incorrect responses with
  high probability. We demonstrate empirically that our approach accurately estimates
  how much models don’t know across ambiguous image classification, (synthetic) language
  modeling, and partially-observable navigation tasks, outperforming existing techniques.'
