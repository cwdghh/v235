title: 'Compositional Capabilities of Autoregressive Transformers: A Study on Synthetic,
  Interpretable Tasks'
openreview: L1eJ3NKPCd
abstract: 'Transformers trained on huge text corpora exhibit a remarkable set of capabilities,
  e.g., performing simple logical operations. Given the inherent compositional nature
  of language, one can expect the model to learn to compose these capabilities, potentially
  yielding a combinatorial explosion of what operations it can perform on an input.
  Motivated by the above, we aim to assess in this paper “how capable can a transformer
  become?”. Specifically, we train autoregressive Transformer models on a data-generating
  process that involves compositions of a set of well-defined monolithic capabilities.
  Through a series of extensive and systematic experiments on this data-generating
  process, we show that: (1) autoregressive Transformers can learn compositional structures
  from small amounts of training data and generalize to exponentially or even combinatorially
  many functions; (2) composing functions by generating intermediate outputs is more
  effective at generalizing to unseen compositions, compared to generating no intermediate
  outputs; (3) biases in the order of the compositions in the training data, results
  in Transformers that fail to compose some combinations of functions; and (4) the
  attention layers seem to select the capability to apply while the feed-forward layers
  execute the capability.'
