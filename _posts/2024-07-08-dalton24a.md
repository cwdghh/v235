title: Physics and Lie symmetry informed Gaussian processes
openreview: 1V50J0emll
abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) has established itself as a new
  scientific paradigm which enables the seamless integration of observational data
  with partial differential equation (PDE) based physics models. A powerful tool for
  the analysis, reduction and solution of PDEs is the Lie symmetry method. Nevertheless,
  only recently has the integration of such symmetries into PIML frameworks begun
  to be explored. The present work adds to this growing literature by introducing
  an approach for incorporating a Lie symmetry into a physics-informed Gaussian process
  (GP) model. The symmetry is introduced as a constraint on the GP; either in a soft
  manner via virtual observations of an induced PDE called the invariant surface condition,
  or explicitly through the design of the kernel. Experimental results demonstrate
  that the use of symmetry constraints improves the performance of the GP for both
  forward and inverse problems, and that our approach offers competitive performance
  with neural networks in the low-data environment.
