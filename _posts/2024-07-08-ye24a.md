title: Towards Robust Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Against Adversarial Corruption
openreview: Z0S6fUdW68
abstract: This study tackles the challenges of adversarial corruption in model-based
  reinforcement learning (RL), where the transition dynamics can be corrupted by an
  adversary. Existing studies on corruption-robust RL mostly focus on the setting
  of model-free RL, where robust least-square regression is often employed for value
  function estimation. However, these techniques cannot be directly applied to model-based
  RL. In this paper, we focus on model-based RL and take the maximum likelihood estimation
  (MLE) approach to learn transition model. Our work encompasses both online and offline
  settings. In the online setting, we introduce an algorithm called corruption-robust
  optimistic MLE (CR-OMLE), which leverages total-variation (TV)-based information
  ratios as uncertainty weights for MLE. We prove that CR-OMLE achieves a regret of
  $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T} + C)$, where $C$ denotes the cumulative corruption
  level after $T$ episodes. We also prove a lower bound to show that the additive
  dependence on $C$ is optimal. We extend our weighting technique to the offline setting,
  and propose an algorithm named corruption-robust pessimistic MLE (CR-PMLE). Under
  a uniform coverage condition, CR-PMLE exhibits suboptimality worsened by $\mathcal{O}(C/n)$,
  nearly matching the lower bound. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
  work on corruption-robust model-based RL algorithms with provable guarantees.
