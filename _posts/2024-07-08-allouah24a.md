title: 'Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning: Impact of Client Subsampling and Local
  Updates'
openreview: Izv7gBnap3
abstract: The possibility of adversarial (a.k.a., Byzantine) clients makes federated
  learning (FL) prone to arbitrary manipulation. The natural approach to robustify
  FL against adversarial clients is to replace the simple averaging operation at the
  server in the standard $\mathsf{FedAvg}$ algorithm by a robust averaging rule. While
  a significant amount of work has been devoted to studying the convergence of federated
  robust averaging (which we denote by $\mathsf{FedRo}$), prior work has largely ignored
  the impact of client subsampling and local steps, two fundamental FL characteristics.
  While client subsampling increases the effective fraction of Byzantine clients,
  local steps increase the drift between the local updates computed by honest (i.e.,
  non-Byzantine) clients. Consequently, a careless deployment of $\mathsf{FedRo}$
  could yield poor performance. We validate this observation by presenting an in-depth
  analysis of $\mathsf{FedRo}$ tightly analyzing the impact of client subsampling
  and local steps. Specifically, we present a sufficient condition on client subsampling
  for nearly-optimal convergence of $\mathsf{FedRo}$ (for smooth non-convex loss).
  Also, we show that the rate of improvement in learning accuracy diminishes with
  respect to the number of clients subsampled, as soon as the sample size exceeds
  a threshold value. Interestingly, we also observe that under a careful choice of
  step-sizes, the learning error due to Byzantine clients decreases with the number
  of local steps. We validate our theory by experiments on the FEMNIST and CIFAR-$10$
  image classification tasks.
