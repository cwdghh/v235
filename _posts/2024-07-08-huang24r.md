title: An Empirical Examination of Balancing Strategy for Counterfactual Estimation
  on Time Series
openreview: Nxz3CDtGXp
abstract: Counterfactual estimation from observations represents a critical endeavor
  in numerous application fields, such as healthcare and finance, with the primary
  challenge being the mitigation of treatment bias. The balancing strategy aimed at
  reducing covariate disparities between different treatment groups serves as a universal
  solution. However, when it comes to the time series data, the effectiveness of balancing
  strategies remains an open question, with a thorough analysis of the robustness
  and applicability of balancing strategies still lacking. This paper revisits counterfactual
  estimation in the temporal setting and provides a brief overview of recent advancements
  in balancing strategies. More importantly, we conduct a critical empirical examination
  for the effectiveness of the balancing strategies within the realm of temporal counterfactual
  estimation in various settings on multiple datasets. Our findings could be of significant
  interest to researchers and practitioners and call for a reexamination of the balancing
  strategy in time series settings.
