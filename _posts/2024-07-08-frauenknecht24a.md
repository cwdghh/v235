title: Trust the Model Where It Trusts Itself - Model-Based Actor-Critic with Uncertainty-Aware
  Rollout Adaption
openreview: N0ntTjTfHb
abstract: 'Dyna-style model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) combines model-free
  agents with predictive transition models through model-based rollouts. This combination
  raises a critical question: “When to trust your model?”; i.e., which rollout length
  results in the model providing useful data? Janner et al. (2019) address this question
  by gradually increasing rollout lengths throughout the training. While theoretically
  tempting, uniform model accuracy is a fallacy that collapses at the latest when
  extrapolating. Instead, we propose asking the question “Where to trust your model?”.
  Using inherent model uncertainty to consider local accuracy, we obtain the Model-Based
  Actor-Critic with Uncertainty-Aware Rollout Adaption (MACURA) algorithm. We propose
  an easy-to-tune rollout mechanism and demonstrate substantial improvements in data
  efficiency and performance compared to state-of-the-art deep MBRL methods on the
  MuJoCo benchmark.'
