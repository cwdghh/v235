title: 'CuTS: Customizable Tabular Synthetic Data Generation'
openreview: Y4VgJfbjfl
abstract: Privacy, data quality, and data sharing concerns pose a key limitation for
  tabular data applications. While generating synthetic data resembling the original
  distribution addresses some of these issues, most applications would benefit from
  additional customization on the generated data. However, existing synthetic data
  approaches are limited to particular constraints, e.g., differential privacy (DP)
  or fairness. In this work, we introduce CuTS, the first customizable synthetic tabular
  data generation framework. Customization in CuTS is achieved via declarative statistical
  and logical expressions, supporting a wide range of requirements (e.g., DP or fairness,
  among others). To ensure high synthetic data quality in the presence of custom specifications,
  CuTS is pre-trained on the original dataset and fine-tuned on a differentiable loss
  automatically derived from the provided specifications using novel relaxations.
  We evaluate CuTS over four datasets and on numerous custom specifications, outperforming
  state-of-the-art specialized approaches on several tasks while being more general.
  In particular, at the same fairness level, we achieve 2.3% higher downstream accuracy
  than the state-of-the-art in fair synthetic data generation on the Adult dataset.
