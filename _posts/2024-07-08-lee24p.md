title: 'Supervised Matrix Factorization: Local Landscape Analysis and Applications'
openreview: YlJy1FcM9E
abstract: Supervised matrix factorization (SMF) is a classical machine learning method
  that seeks low-dimensional feature extraction and classification tasks at the same
  time. Training an SMF model involves solving a non-convex and factor-wise constrained
  optimization problem with at least three blocks of parameters. Due to the high non-convexity
  and constraints, theoretical understanding of the optimization landscape of SMF
  has been limited. In this paper, we provide an extensive local landscape analysis
  for SMF and derive several theoretical and practical applications. Analyzing diagonal
  blocks of the Hessian naturally leads to a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm
  with adaptive step sizes. We provide global convergence and iteration complexity
  guarantees for this algorithm. Full Hessian analysis gives minimum $L_{2}$-regularization
  to guarantee local strong convexity and robustness of parameters. We establish a
  local estimation guarantee under a statistical SMF model. We also propose a novel
  GPU-friendly neural implementation of the BCD algorithm and validate our theoretical
  findings through numerical experiments. Our work contributes to a deeper understanding
  of SMF optimization, offering insights into the optimization landscape and providing
  practical solutions to enhance its performance.
