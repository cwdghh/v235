title: An Information Theoretic Approach to Interaction-Grounded Learning
openreview: Sra298VMFM
abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) problems where the learner attempts to infer
  an unobserved reward from some feedback variables have been studied in several recent
  papers. The setting of Interaction-Grounded Learning (IGL) is an example of such
  feedback-based reinforcement learning tasks where the learner optimizes the return
  by inferring latent binary rewards from the interaction with the environment. In
  the IGL setting, a relevant assumption used in the RL literature is that the feedback
  variable $Y$ is conditionally independent of the context-action $(X,A)$ given the
  latent reward $R$. In this work, we propose <em>Variational Information-based IGL
  (VI-IGL)</em> as an information-theoretic method to enforce the conditional independence
  assumption in the IGL-based RL problem. The VI-IGL framework learns a reward decoder
  using an information-based objective based on the conditional mutual information
  (MI) between the context-action $(X,A)$ and the feedback variable $Y$ observed from
  the environment. To estimate and optimize the information-based terms for the continuous
  random variables in the RL problem, VI-IGL leverages the variational representation
  of mutual information and results in a min-max optimization problem. Theoretical
  analysis shows that the optimization problem can be sample-efficiently solved. Furthermore,
  we extend the VI-IGL framework to general $f$-Information measures in the information
  theory literature, leading to the generalized $f$-VI-IGL framework to address the
  RL problem under the IGL condition. Finally, the empirical results on several reinforcement
  learning settings indicate an improved performance in comparison to the previous
  IGL-based RL algorithm.
