title: 'SuDA: Support-based Domain Adaptation for Sim2Real Hinge Joint Tracking with
  Flexible Sensors'
openreview: ENNGAY5uKC
abstract: Flexible sensors hold promise for human motion capture (MoCap), offering
  advantages such as wearability, privacy preservation, and minimal constraints on
  natural movement. However, existing flexible sensor-based MoCap methods rely on
  deep learning and necessitate large and diverse labeled datasets for training. These
  data typically need to be collected in MoCap studios with specialized equipment
  and substantial manual labor, making them difficult and expensive to obtain at scale.
  Thanks to the high-linearity of flexible sensors, we address this challenge by proposing
  a novel Sim2Real solution for hinge joint tracking based on domain adaptation, eliminating
  the need for labeled data yet achieving comparable accuracy to supervised learning.
  Our solution relies on a novel Support-based Domain Adaptation method, namely SuDA,
  which aligns the supports of the predictive functions rather than the instance-dependent
  distributions between the source and target domains. Extensive experimental results
  demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its superiority overstate-of-the-art
  distribution-based domain adaptation methods in our task.
