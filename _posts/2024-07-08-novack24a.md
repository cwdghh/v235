title: 'DITTO: Diffusion Inference-Time T-Optimization for Music Generation'
openreview: z5Ux2u6t7U
abstract: We propose Diffusion Inference-Time T-Optimization (DITTO), a general-purpose
  framework for controlling pre-trained text-to-music diffusion models at inference-time
  via optimizing initial noise latents. Our method can be used to optimize through
  any differentiable feature matching loss to achieve a target (stylized) output and
  leverages gradient checkpointing for memory efficiency. We demonstrate a surprisingly
  wide-range of applications for music generation including inpainting, outpainting,
  and looping as well as intensity, melody, and musical structure control â€“ all without
  ever fine-tuning the underlying model. When we compare our approach against related
  training, guidance, and optimization-based methods, we find DITTO achieves state-of-the-art
  performance on nearly all tasks, including outperforming comparable approaches on
  controllability, audio quality, and computational efficiency, thus opening the door
  for high-quality, flexible, training-free control of diffusion models. Sound examples
