title: Causal Customer Churn Analysis with Low-rank Tensor Block Hazard Model
openreview: ihv6pWuILN
abstract: This study introduces an innovative method for analyzing the impact of various
  interventions on customer churn, using the potential outcomes framework. We present
  a new causal model, the tensorized latent factor block hazard model, which incorporates
  tensor completion methods for a principled causal analysis of customer churn. A
  crucial element of our approach is the formulation of a 1-bit tensor completion
  for the parameter tensor. This captures hidden customer characteristics and temporal
  elements from churn records, effectively addressing the binary nature of churn data
  and its time-monotonic trends. Our model also uniquely categorizes interventions
  by their similar impacts, enhancing the precision and practicality of implementing
  customer retention strategies. For computational efficiency, we apply a projected
  gradient descent algorithm combined with spectral clustering. We lay down the theoretical
  groundwork for our model, including its non-asymptotic properties. The efficacy
  and superiority of our model are further validated through comprehensive experiments
  on both simulated and real-world applications.
