title: On PI Controllers for Updating Lagrange Multipliers in Constrained Optimization
openreview: 1khG2xf1yt
abstract: Constrained optimization offers a powerful framework to prescribe desired
  behaviors in neural network models. Typically, constrained problems are solved via
  their min-max Lagrangian formulations, which exhibit unstable oscillatory dynamics
  when optimized using gradient descent-ascent. The adoption of constrained optimization
  techniques in the machine learning community is currently limited by the lack of
  reliable, general-purpose update schemes for the Lagrange multipliers. This paper
  proposes the νPI algorithm and contributes an optimization perspective on Lagrange
  multiplier updates based on PI controllers, extending the work of Stooke, Achiam
  and Abbeel (2020). We provide theoretical and empirical insights explaining the
  inability of momentum methods to address the shortcomings of gradient descent-ascent,
  and contrast this with the empirical success of our proposed νPI controller. Moreover,
  we prove that νPI generalizes popular momentum methods for single-objective minimization.
  Our experiments demonstrate that νPI reliably stabilizes the multiplier dynamics
  and its hyperparameters enjoy robust and predictable behavior.
