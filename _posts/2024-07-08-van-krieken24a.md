title: On the Independence Assumption in Neurosymbolic Learning
openreview: S1gSrruVd4
abstract: State-of-the-art neurosymbolic learning systems use probabilistic reasoning
  to guide neural networks towards predictions that conform to logical constraints.
  Many such systems assume that the probabilities of the considered symbols are conditionally
  independent given the input to simplify learning and reasoning. We study and criticise
  this assumption, highlighting how it can hinder optimisation and prevent uncertainty
  quantification. We prove that loss functions bias conditionally independent neural
  networks to become overconfident in their predictions. As a result, they are unable
  to represent uncertainty over multiple valid options. Furthermore, we prove that
  the minima of such loss functions are usually highly disconnected and non-convex,
  and thus difficult to optimise. Our theoretical analysis gives the foundation for
  replacing the conditional independence assumption and designing more expressive
  neurosymbolic probabilistic models.
