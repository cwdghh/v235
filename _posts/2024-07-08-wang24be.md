title: 'A Fine-grained Analysis of Fitted Q-evaluation: Beyond Parametric Models'
openreview: D32aTei4p5
abstract: 'In this paper, we delve into the statistical analysis of the fitted Q-evaluation
  (FQE) method, which focuses on estimating the value of a target policy using offline
  data generated by some behavior policy. We provide a comprehensive theoretical understanding
  of FQE estimators under both parametric and non-parametric models on the Q-function.
  Specifically, we address three key questions related to FQE that remain largely
  unexplored in the current literature: (1) Is the optimal convergence rate for estimating
  the policy value regarding the sample size $n$ ($n^{âˆ’1/2}$) achievable for FQE under
  a nonparametric model with a fixed horizon ($T$ )? (2) How does the error bound
  depend on the horizon T ? (3) What is the role of the probability ratio function
  in improving the convergence of FQE estimators? Specifically, we show that under
  the completeness assumption of Q-functions, which is mild in the non-parametric
  setting, the estimation errors for policy value using both parametric and non-parametric
  FQE estimators can achieve an optimal rate in terms of n. The corresponding error
  bounds in terms of both $n$ and $T$ are also established. With an additional realizability
  assumption on ratio functions, the rate of estimation errors can be improved from
  $T^{ 1.5}/\sqrt{n}$ to $T /\sqrt{n}$, which matches the sharpest known bound in
  the current literature under the tabular setting.'
