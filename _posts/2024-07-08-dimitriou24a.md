title: 'Structure Your Data: Towards Semantic Graph Counterfactuals'
openreview: OenMwDPqWn
abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CEs) based on concepts are explanations that
  consider alternative scenarios to understand which high-level semantic features
  contributed to particular model predictions. In this work, we propose CEs based
  on the semantic graphs accompanying input data to achieve more descriptive, accurate,
  and human-aligned explanations. Building upon state-of-the-art (SotA) conceptual
  attempts, we adopt a model-agnostic edit-based approach and introduce leveraging
  GNNs for efficient Graph Edit Distance (GED) computation. With a focus on the visual
  domain, we represent images as scene graphs and obtain their GNN embeddings to bypass
  solving the NP-hard graph similarity problem for all input pairs, an integral part
  of CE computation process. We apply our method to benchmark and real-world datasets
  with varying difficulty and availability of semantic annotations. Testing on diverse
  classifiers, we find that our CEs outperform previous SotA explanation models based
  on semantics, including both white and black-box as well as conceptual and pixel-level
  approaches. Their superiority is proven quantitatively and qualitatively, as validated
  by human subjects, highlighting the significance of leveraging semantic edges in
  the presence of intricate relationships. Our model-agnostic graph-based approach
  is widely applicable and easily extensible, producing actionable explanations across
  different contexts. The code is available at https://github.com/aggeliki-dimitriou/SGCE.
