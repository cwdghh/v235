title: 'Beyond Implicit Bias: The Insignificance of SGD Noise in Online Learning'
openreview: RiQbe8RwCe
abstract: The success of SGD in deep learning has been ascribed by prior works to
  the <em>implicit bias</em> induced by finite batch sizes (”SGD noise”). While prior
  works focused on <em>offline learning</em> (i.e., multiple-epoch training), we study
  the impact of SGD noise on <em>online</em> (i.e., single epoch) learning. Through
  an extensive empirical analysis of image and language data, we demonstrate that
  small batch sizes do <em>not</em> confer any implicit bias advantages in online
  learning. In contrast to offline learning, the benefits of SGD noise in online learning
  are strictly computational, facilitating more cost-effective gradient steps. This
  suggests that SGD in the online regime can be construed as taking noisy steps along
  the ”golden path” of the noiseless <em>gradient descent</em> algorithm. We study
  this hypothesis and provide supporting evidence in loss and function space. Our
  findings challenge the prevailing understanding of SGD and offer novel insights
  into its role in online learning.
