title: Semantic-Aware Human Object Interaction Image Generation
openreview: vITl6CqIkk
abstract: Recent text-to-image generative models have demonstrated remarkable abilities
  in generating realistic images. Despite their great success, these models struggle
  to generate high-fidelity images with prompts oriented toward human-object interaction
  (HOI). The difficulty in HOI generation arises from two aspects. Firstly, the complexity
  and diversity of human poses challenge plausible human generation. Furthermore,
  untrustworthy generation of interaction boundary regions may lead to deficiency
  in HOI semantics. To tackle the problems, we propose a Semantic-Aware HOI generation
  framework SA-HOI . It utilizes human pose quality and interaction boundary region
  information as guidance for denoising process, thereby encouraging refinement in
  these regions to produce more reasonable HOI images. Based on it, we establish an
  iterative inversion and image refinement pipeline to continually enhance generation
  quality. Further, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for HOI generation, which
  comprises a dataset involving diverse and fine-grained HOI categories, along with
  multiple custom-tailored evaluation metrics for HOI generation. Experiments demonstrate
  that our method significantly improves generation quality under both HOI-specific
  and conventional image evaluation metrics. The code is available at https://github.com/XZPKU/SA-HOI.git
