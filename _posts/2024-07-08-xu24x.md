title: Pricing with Contextual Elasticity and Heteroscedastic Valuation
openreview: 51gXk4BISH
abstract: We study an online contextual dynamic pricing problem, where customers decide
  whether to purchase a product based on its features and price. We introduce a novel
  approach to modeling a customerâ€™s expected demand by incorporating feature-based
  price elasticity, which can be equivalently represented as a valuation with heteroscedastic
  noise. To solve the problem, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm called
  "Pricing with Perturbation (PwP)", which enjoys an $O(\sqrt{dT\log T})$ regret while
  allowing arbitrary adversarial input context sequences. We also prove a matching
  lower bound at $\Omega(\sqrt{dT})$ to show the optimality regarding $d$ and $T$
  (up to $\log T$ factors). Our results shed light on the relationship between contextual
  elasticity and heteroscedastic valuation, providing insights for effective and practical
  pricing strategies.
