title: Toward Availability Attacks in 3D Point Clouds
openreview: C0sGIO2MZN
abstract: Despite the great progress of 3D vision, data privacy and security issues
  in 3D deep learning are not explored systematically. In the domain of 2D images,
  many availability attacks have been proposed to prevent data from being illicitly
  learned by unauthorized deep models. However, unlike images represented on a fixed
  dimensional grid, point clouds are characterized as unordered and unstructured sets,
  posing a significant challenge in designing an effective availability attack for
  3D deep learning. In this paper, we theoretically show that extending 2D availability
  attacks directly to 3D point clouds under distance regularization is susceptible
  to the degeneracy, rendering the generated poisons weaker or even ineffective. This
  is because in bi-level optimization, introducing regularization term can result
  in update directions out of control. To address this issue, we propose a novel Feature
  Collision Error-Minimization (FC-EM) method, which creates additional shortcuts
  in the feature space, inducing different update directions to prevent the degeneracy
  of bi-level optimization. Moreover, we provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates
  the effectiveness of the FC-EM attack. Extensive experiments on typical point cloud
  datasets, 3D intracranial aneurysm medical dataset, and 3D face dataset verify the
  superiority and practicality of our approach.
