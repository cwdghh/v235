title: Improved Stability and Generalization Guarantees of the Decentralized SGD Algorithm
openreview: JKPhWzp7Oi
abstract: This paper presents a new generalization error analysis for Decentralized
  Stochastic Gradient Descent (D-SGD) based on algorithmic stability. The obtained
  results overhaul a series of recent works that suggested an increased instability
  due to decentralization and a detrimental impact of poorly-connected communication
  graphs on generalization. On the contrary, we show, for convex, strongly convex
  and non-convex functions, that D-SGD can always recover generalization bounds analogous
  to those of classical SGD, suggesting that the choice of graph does not matter.
  We then argue that this result is coming from a worst-case analysis, and we provide
  a refined optimization-dependent generalization bound for general convex functions.
  This new bound reveals that the choice of graph can in fact improve the worst-case
  bound in certain regimes, and that surprisingly, a poorly-connected graph can even
  be beneficial for generalization.
