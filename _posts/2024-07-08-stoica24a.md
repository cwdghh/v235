title: Causal Inference from Competing Treatments
openreview: HZ6lrZzB02
abstract: 'Many applications of RCTs involve the presence of multiple treatment administrators—from
  field experiments to online advertising—that compete for the subjects’ attention.
  In the face of competition, estimating a causal effect becomes difficult, as the
  position at which a subject sees a treatment influences their response, and thus
  the treatment effect. In this paper, we build a game-theoretic model of agents who
  wish to estimate causal effects in the presence of competition, through a bidding
  system and a utility function that minimizes estimation error. Our main technical
  result establishes an approximation with a tractable objective that maximizes the
  sample value obtained through strategically allocating budget on subjects. This
  allows us to find an equilibrium in our model: we show that the tractable objective
  has a pure Nash equilibrium, and that any Nash equilibrium is an approximate equilibrium
  for our general objective that minimizes estimation error under broad conditions.
  Conceptually, our work successfully combines elements from causal inference and
  game theory to shed light on the equilibrium behavior of experimentation under competition.'
