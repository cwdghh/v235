title: A Neural-Preconditioned Poisson Solver for Mixed Dirichlet and Neumann Boundary
  Conditions
openreview: VAKkoJjVpn
abstract: We introduce a neural-preconditioned iterative solver for Poisson equations
  with mixed boundary conditions. Typical Poisson discretizations yield large, ill-conditioned
  linear systems. Iterative solvers can be effective for these problems, but only
  when equipped with powerful preconditioners. Unfortunately, effective preconditioners
  like multigrid require costly setup phases that must be re-executed every time domain
  shapes or boundary conditions change, forming a severe bottleneck for problems with
  evolving boundaries. In contrast, we present a neural preconditioner trained to
  efficiently approximate the inverse of the discrete Laplacian in the presence of
  such changes. Our approach generalizes to domain shapes, boundary conditions, and
  grid sizes outside the training set. The key to our preconditionerâ€™s success is
  a novel, lightweight neural network architecture featuring spatially varying convolution
  kernels and supporting fast inference. We demonstrate that our solver outperforms
  state-of-the-art methods like algebraic multigrid as well as recently proposed neural
  preconditioners on challenging test cases arising from incompressible fluid simulations.
