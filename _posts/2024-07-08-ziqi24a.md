title: Batch Singular Value Polarization and Weighted Semantic Augmentation for Universal
  Domain Adaptation
openreview: teteOa9nJ9
abstract: As a more challenging domain adaptation setting, universal domain adaptation
  (UniDA) introduces category shift on top of domain shift, which needs to identify
  unknown category in the target domain and avoid misclassifying target samples into
  source private categories. To this end, we propose a novel UniDA approach named
  Batch Singular value Polarization and Weighted Semantic Augmentation (BSP-WSA).
  Specifically, we adopt an adversarial classifier to identify the target unknown
  category and align feature distributions between the two domains. Then, we propose
  to perform SVD on the classifierâ€™s outputs to maximize larger singular values while
  minimizing those smaller ones, which could prevent target samples from being wrongly
  assigned to source private classes. To better bridge the domain gap, we propose
  a weighted semantic augmentation approach for UniDA to generate data on common categories
  between the two domains. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that
  BSP-WSA could outperform existing state-of-the-art UniDA approaches.
