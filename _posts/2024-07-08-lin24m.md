title: 'HGAP: Boosting Permutation Invariant and Permutation Equivariant in Multi-Agent
  Reinforcement Learning via Graph Attention Network'
openreview: KpUdNe9lsr
abstract: Graph representation has gained widespread application across various machine
  learning domains, attributed to its ability to discern correlations among input
  nodes. In the realm of Multi- agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), agents are tasked
  with observing other entities within their environment to determine their behavior.
  Conventional MARL methodologies often suffer from training difficulties if Permutation
  Invariant (PI) and Permutation Equivariant (PE) properties are not considered during
  training. The adoption of graph representation offers a solution to these challenges
  by conceptualizing observed entities as a graph. In this context, we introduce the
  Hyper Graphical Attention Policy (HGAP) Network, which employs a graph attention
  mechanism to fulfill the PI and PE properties, while also understanding inter-entity
  interactions for decision-making. HGAP is assessed across various MARL benchmarks
  to confirm its effectiveness and efficiency. In addition, a series of ablation studies
  are provided to demonstrate its adaptability, transferability, and the capability
  to alleviate the complexities introduced by the POMDP constraint.
