title: 'VideoPoet: A Large Language Model for Zero-Shot Video Generation'
openreview: LRkJwPIDuE
abstract: 'We present VideoPoet, a language model capable of synthesizing high-quality
  video from a large variety of conditioning signals. VideoPoet employs a decoder-only
  transformer architecture that processes multimodal inputs – including images, videos,
  text, and audio. The training protocol follows that of Large Language Models (LLMs),
  consisting of two stages: pretraining and task-specific adaptation. During pretraining,
  VideoPoet incorporates a mixture of multimodal generative objectives within an autoregressive
  Transformer framework. The pretrained LLM serves as a foundation that can be adapted
  for a range of video generation tasks. We present empirical results demonstrating
  the model’s state-of-the-art capabilities in zero-shot video generation, specifically
  highlighting the ability to generate high-fidelity motions. Project page: http://sites.research.google/videopoet/'
