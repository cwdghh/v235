title: Bivariate Causal Discovery using Bayesian Model Selection
openreview: twm7qPVX1F
abstract: Much of the causal discovery literature prioritises guaranteeing the identifiability
  of causal direction in statistical models. For structures within a Markov equivalence
  class, this requires strong assumptions which may not hold in real-world datasets,
  ultimately limiting the usability of these methods. Building on previous attempts,
  we show how to incorporate causal assumptions within the Bayesian framework. Identifying
  causal direction then becomes a Bayesian model selection problem. This enables us
  to construct models with realistic assumptions, and consequently allows for the
  differentiation between Markov equivalent causal structures. We analyse why Bayesian
  model selection works in situations where methods based on maximum likelihood fail.
  To demonstrate our approach, we construct a Bayesian non-parametric model that can
  flexibly model the joint distribution. We then outperform previous methods on a
  wide range of benchmark datasets with varying data generating assumptions.
