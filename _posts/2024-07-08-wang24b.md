title: 'One Prompt is not Enough: Automated Construction of a Mixture-of-Expert Prompts'
openreview: edHLN40DWu
abstract: 'Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong generalization capabilities
  to novel tasks when prompted with language instructions and in-context demos. Since
  this ability sensitively depends on the quality of prompts, various methods have
  been explored to automate the instruction design. While these methods demonstrated
  promising results, they also restricted the searched prompt to one instruction.
  Such simplification significantly limits their capacity, as a single demo-free instruction
  might not be able to cover the entire complex problem space of the targeted task.
  To alleviate this issue, we adopt the Mixture-of-Expert paradigm and divide the
  problem space into a set of sub-regions; Each sub-region is governed by a specialized
  expert, equipped with both an instruction and a set of demos. A two-phase process
  is developed to construct the specialized expert for each region: (1) demo assignment:
  Inspired by the theoretical connection between in-context learning and kernel regression,
  we group demos into experts based on their semantic similarity; (2) instruction
  assignment: A region-based joint search of an instruction per expert complements
  the demos assigned to it, yielding a synergistic effect. The resulting method, codenamed
  Mixture-of-Prompts (MoP), achieves an average win rate of 81% against prior arts
  across several major benchmarks.'
