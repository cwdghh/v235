title: Breadth-First Exploration on Adaptive Grid for Reinforcement Learning
openreview: 59MYoLghyk
abstract: Graph-based planners have gained significant attention for goal-conditioned
  reinforcement learning (RL), where they construct a graph consisting of confident
  transitions between <em>subgoals</em> as edges and run shortest path algorithms
  to exploit the confident edges. Meanwhile, identifying and avoiding unattainable
  transitions are also crucial yet overlooked by the previous graph-based planners,
  leading to wasting an excessive number of attempts at unattainable subgoals. To
  address this oversight, we propose a graph construction method that efficiently
  manages all the achieved and unattained subgoals on a grid graph adaptively discretizing
  the goal space. This enables a breadth-first exploration strategy, grounded in the
  local adaptive grid refinement, that prioritizes broad probing of subgoals on a
  coarse grid over meticulous one on a dense grid. We conducted a theoretical analysis
  and demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach through empirical evidence, showing
  that only BEAG succeeds in complex environments under the proposed fixed-goal setting.
