title: Neural NeRF Compression
openreview: 6BYD121JFO
abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as powerful tools for capturing
  detailed 3D scenes through continuous volumetric representations. Recent NeRFs utilize
  feature grids to improve rendering quality and speed; however, these representations
  introduce significant storage overhead. This paper presents a novel method for efficiently
  compressing a grid-based NeRF model, addressing the storage overhead concern. Our
  approach is based on the non-linear transform coding paradigm, employing neural
  compression for compressing the modelâ€™s feature grids. Due to the lack of training
  data involving many i.i.d scenes, we design an encoder-free, end-to-end optimized
  approach for individual scenes, using lightweight decoders. To leverage the spatial
  inhomogeneity of the latent feature grids, we introduce an importance-weighted rate-distortion
  objective and a sparse entropy model employing a masking mechanism. Our experimental
  results validate that our proposed method surpasses existing works in terms of grid-based
  NeRF compression efficacy and reconstruction quality.
