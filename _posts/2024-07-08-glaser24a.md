title: Kernel-Based Evaluation of Conditional Biological Sequence Models
openreview: 2dlmcTXfcY
abstract: We propose a set of kernel-based tools to evaluate the designs and tune
  the hyperparameters of conditional sequence models, with a focus on problems in
  computational biology. The backbone of our tools is a new measure of discrepancy
  between the true conditional distribution and the model’s estimate, called the Augmented
  Conditional Maximum Mean Discrepancy (ACMMD). Provided that the model can be sampled
  from, the ACMMD can be estimated unbiasedly from data to quantify absolute model
  fit, integrated within hypothesis tests, and used to evaluate model reliability.
  We demonstrate the utility of our approach by analyzing a popular protein design
  model, ProteinMPNN. We are able to reject the hypothesis that ProteinMPNN fits its
  data for various protein families, and tune the model’s temperature hyperparameter
  to achieve a better fit.
