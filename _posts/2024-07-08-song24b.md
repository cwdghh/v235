title: Multimodal Prototyping for cancer survival prediction
openreview: 3MfvxH3Gia
abstract: 'Multimodal survival methods combining gigapixel histology whole-slide images
  (WSIs) and transcriptomic profiles are particularly promising for patient prognostication
  and stratification. Current approaches involve tokenizing the WSIs into smaller
  patches ($>10^4$ patches) and transcriptomics into gene groups, which are then integrated
  using a Transformer for predicting outcomes. However, this process generates many
  tokens, which leads to high memory requirements for computing attention and complicates
  post-hoc interpretability analyses. Instead, we hypothesize that we can: (1) effectively
  summarize the morphological content of a WSI by condensing its constituting tokens
  using morphological prototypes, achieving more than $300\times$ compression; and
  (2) accurately characterize cellular functions by encoding the transcriptomic profile
  with biological pathway prototypes, all in an unsupervised fashion. The resulting
  multimodal tokens are then processed by a fusion network, either with a Transformer
  or an optimal transport cross-alignment, which now operates with a small and fixed
  number of tokens without approximations. Extensive evaluation on six cancer types
  shows that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods with much less computation
  while unlocking new interpretability analyses. The code is available at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/MMP.'
