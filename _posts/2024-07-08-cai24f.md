title: Accelerated Algorithms for Constrained Nonconvex-Nonconcave Min-Max Optimization
  and Comonotone Inclusion
openreview: EK7fuAMNoI
abstract: We study constrained comonotone min-max optimization, a structured class
  of nonconvex-nonconcave min-max optimization problems, and their generalization
  to comonotone inclusion. In our first contribution, we extend the <em>Extra Anchored
  Gradient (EAG)</em> algorithm, originally proposed by Yoon and Ryu (2021) for unconstrained
  min-max optimization, to constrained comonotone min-max optimization and comonotone
  inclusion, achieving an optimal convergence rate of $O\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)$
  among all first-order methods. Additionally, we prove that the algorithmâ€™s iterations
  converge to a point in the solution set. In our second contribution, we extend the
  <em>Fast Extra Gradient (FEG)</em> algorithm, as developed by Lee and Kim (2021),
  to constrained comonotone min-max optimization and comonotone inclusion, achieving
  the same $O\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)$ convergence rate. This rate is applicable to
  the broadest set of comonotone inclusion problems yet studied in the literature.
  Our analyses are based on simple potential function arguments, which might be useful
  for analyzing other accelerated algorithms.
