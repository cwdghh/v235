title: 'Unmasking Vulnerabilities: Cardinality Sketches under Adaptive Inputs'
openreview: jaJxpKkBcL
abstract: Cardinality sketches are popular data structures that enhance the efficiency
  of working with large data sets. The sketches are randomized representations of
  sets that are only of logarithmic size but can support set merges and approximate
  cardinality (i.e., distinct count) queries. When queries are not adaptive, that
  is, they do not depend on preceding query responses, the design provides strong
  guarantees of correctly answering a number of queries exponential in the sketch
  size $k$. In this work, we investigate the performance of cardinality sketches in
  adaptive settings and unveil inherent vulnerabilities. We design an attack against
  the “standard” estimators that constructs an adversarial input by post-processing
  responses to a set of simple non-adaptive queries of size linear in the sketch size
  $k$. Empirically, our attack used only $4k$ queries with the widely used HyperLogLog
  (HLL++) Flajolet et al., 2007; Heule et al., 2013) sketch. The simple attack technique
  suggests it can be effective with post-processed natural workloads. Finally and
  importantly, we demonstrate that the vulnerability is inherent as any estimator
  applied to known sketch structures can be attacked using a number of queries that
  is quadratic in $k$, matching a generic upper bound.
