title: Unsupervised Representation Learning of Brain Activity via Bridging Voxel Activity
  and Functional Connectivity
openreview: nOjZfpLyh1
abstract: Effective brain representation learning is a key step toward the understanding
  of cognitive processes and diagnosis of neurological diseases/disorders. Existing
  studies have focused on either (1) voxel-level activity, where only a single weight
  relating the voxel activity to the task (i.e., aggregation of voxel activity over
  a time window) is considered, missing their temporal dynamics, or (2) functional
  connectivity of the brain in the level of region of interests, missing voxel-level
  activities. We bridge this gap and design BrainMixer, an unsupervised learning framework
  that effectively utilizes both functional connectivity and associated time series
  of voxels to learn voxel-level representation in an unsupervised manner. BrainMixer
  employs two simple yet effective MLP-based encoders to simultaneously learn the
  dynamics of voxel-level signals and their functional correlations. To encode voxel
  activity, BrainMixer fuses information across both time and voxel dimensions via
  a dynamic attention mechanism. To learn the structure of the functional connectivity,
  BrainMixer presents a temporal graph patching and encodes each patch by combining
  its nodesâ€™ features via a new adaptive temporal pooling. Our experiments show that
  BrainMixer attains outstanding performance and outperforms 14 baselines in different
  downstream tasks and setups.
