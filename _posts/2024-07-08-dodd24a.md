title: Learning-Rate-Free Stochastic Optimization over Riemannian Manifolds
openreview: eY98MVffrD
abstract: In recent years, interest in gradient-based optimization over Riemannian
  manifolds has surged. However, a significant challenge lies in the reliance on hyperparameters,
  especially the learning rate, which requires meticulous tuning by practitioners
  to ensure convergence at a suitable rate. In this work, we introduce innovative
  learning-rate-free algorithms for stochastic optimization over Riemannian manifolds,
  eliminating the need for hand-tuning and providing a more robust and user-friendly
  approach. We establish high probability convergence guarantees that are optimal,
  up to logarithmic factors, compared to the best-known optimally tuned rate in the
  deterministic setting. Our approach is validated through numerical experiments,
  demonstrating competitive performance against learning-rate-dependent algorithms.
