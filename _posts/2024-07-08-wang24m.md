title: Imitation Learning from Purified Demonstrations
openreview: dyfsPNuYCk
abstract: Imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach for addressing sequential
  decision-making problems, with the assumption that expert demonstrations are optimal.
  However, in real-world scenarios, most demonstrations are often imperfect, leading
  to challenges in the effectiveness of imitation learning. While existing research
  has focused on optimizing with imperfect demonstrations, the training typically
  requires a certain proportion of optimal demonstrations to guarantee performance.
  To tackle these problems, we propose to purify the potential noises in imperfect
  demonstrations first, and subsequently conduct imitation learning from these purified
  demonstrations. Motivated by the success of diffusion model, we introduce a two-step
  purification via diffusion process. In the first step, we apply a forward diffusion
  process to smooth potential noises in imperfect demonstrations by introducing additional
  noise. Subsequently, a reverse generative process is utilized to recover the optimal
  demonstration from the diffused ones. We provide theoretical evidence supporting
  our approach, demonstrating that the distance between the purified and optimal demonstration
  can be bounded. Empirical results on MuJoCo and RoboSuite demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our method from different aspects.
