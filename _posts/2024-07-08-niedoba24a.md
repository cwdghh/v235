title: Nearest Neighbour Score Estimators for Diffusion Generative Models
openreview: hqNz4LDuhn
abstract: Score function estimation is the cornerstone of both training and sampling
  from diffusion generative models. Despite this fact, the most commonly used estimators
  are either biased neural network approximations or high variance Monte Carlo estimators
  based on the conditional score. We introduce a novel nearest neighbour score function
  estimator which utilizes multiple samples from the training set to dramatically
  decrease estimator variance. We leverage our low variance estimator in two compelling
  applications. Training consistency models with our estimator, we report a significant
  increase in both convergence speed and sample quality. In diffusion models, we show
  that our estimator can replace a learned network for probability-flow ODE integration,
  opening promising new avenues of future research. Code will be released upon paper
  acceptance.
