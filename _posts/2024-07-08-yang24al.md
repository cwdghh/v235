title: 'Mol-AE: Auto-Encoder Based Molecular Representation Learning With 3D Cloze
  Test Objective'
openreview: inEuvSg0y1
abstract: '3D molecular representation learning has gained tremendous interest and
  achieved promising performance in various downstream tasks. A series of recent approaches
  follow a prevalent framework: an encoder-only model coupled with a coordinate denoising
  objective. However, through a series of analytical experiments, we prove that the
  encoder-only model with coordinate denoising objective exhibits inconsistency between
  pre-training and downstream objectives, as well as issues with disrupted atomic
  identifiers. To address these two issues, we propose Mol-AE for molecular representation
  learning, an auto-encoder model using positional encoding as atomic identifiers.
  We also propose a new training objective named 3D Cloze Test to make the model learn
  better atom spatial relationships from real molecular substructures. Empirical results
  demonstrate that Mol-AE achieves a large margin performance gain compared to the
  current state-of-the-art 3D molecular modeling approach.'
