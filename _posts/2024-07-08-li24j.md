title: Completing Visual Objects via Bridging Generation and Segmentation
openreview: nLgtHHBgl3
abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to object completion, with the primary
  goal of reconstructing a complete object from its partially visible components.
  Our method, named MaskComp, delineates the completion process through iterative
  stages of generation and segmentation. In each iteration, the object mask is provided
  as an additional condition to boost image generation, and, in return, the generated
  images can lead to a more accurate mask by fusing the segmentation of images. We
  demonstrate that the combination of one generation and one segmentation stage effectively
  functions as a mask denoiser. Through alternation between the generation and segmentation
  stages, the partial object mask is progressively refined, providing precise shape
  guidance and yielding superior object completion results. Our experiments demonstrate
  the superiority of MaskComp over existing approaches, e.g., ControlNet and Stable
  Diffusion, establishing it as an effective solution for object completion.
