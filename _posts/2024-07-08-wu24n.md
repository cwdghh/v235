title: 'DISCRET: Synthesizing Faithful Explanations For Treatment Effect Estimation'
openreview: B0xmynxt4f
abstract: 'Designing faithful yet accurate AI models is challenging, particularly
  in the field of individual treatment effect estimation (ITE). ITE prediction models
  deployed in critical settings such as healthcare should ideally be (i) accurate,
  and (ii) provide faithful explanations. However, current solutions are inadequate:
  state-of-the-art black-box models do not supply explanations, post-hoc explainers
  for black-box models lack faithfulness guarantees, and self-interpretable models
  greatly compromise accuracy. To address these issues, we propose DISCRET, a self-interpretable
  ITE framework that synthesizes faithful, rule-based explanations for each sample.
  A key insight behind DISCRET is that explanations can serve dually as <em>database
  queries</em> to identify similar subgroups of samples. We provide a novel RL algorithm
  to efficiently synthesize these explanations from a large search space. We evaluate
  DISCRET on diverse tasks involving tabular, image, and text data. DISCRET outperforms
  the best self-interpretable models and has accuracy comparable to the best black-box
  models while providing faithful explanations. DISCRET is available at https://github.com/wuyinjun-1993/DISCRET-ICML2024.'
