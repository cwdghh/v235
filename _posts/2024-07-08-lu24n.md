title: 'OxyGenerator: Reconstructing Global Ocean Deoxygenation Over a Century with
  Deep Learning'
openreview: 0HUInAsdoo
abstract: Accurately reconstructing the global ocean deoxygenation over a century
  is crucial for assessing and protecting marine ecosystem. Existing expert-dominated
  numerical simulations fail to catch up with the dynamic variation caused by global
  warming and human activities. Besides, due to the high-cost data collection, the
  historical observations are severely sparse, leading to big challenge for precise
  reconstruction. In this work, we propose OxyGenerator, the first deep learning based
  model, to reconstruct the global ocean deoxygenation from 1920 to 2023. Specifically,
  to address the heterogeneity across large temporal and spatial scales, we propose
  zoning-varying graph message-passing to capture the complex oceanographic correlations
  between missing values and sparse observations. Additionally, to further calibrate
  the uncertainty, we incorporate inductive bias from dissolved oxygen (DO) variations
  and chemical effects. Compared with in-situ DO observations, OxyGenerator significantly
  outperforms CMIP6 numerical simulations, reducing MAPE by 38.77%, demonstrating
  a promising potential to understand the “breathless ocean” in data-driven manner.
