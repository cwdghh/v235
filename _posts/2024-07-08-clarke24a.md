title: Studying K-FAC Heuristics by Viewing Adam through a Second-Order Lens
openreview: mK6FB9xQ7v
abstract: 'Research into optimisation for deep learning is characterised by a tension
  between the computational efficiency of first-order, gradient-based methods (such
  as SGD and Adam) and the theoretical efficiency of second-order, curvature-based
  methods (such as quasi-Newton methods and K-FAC). Noting that second-order methods
  often only function effectively with the addition of stabilising heuristics (such
  as Levenberg-Marquardt damping), we ask how much these (as opposed to the second-order
  curvature model) contribute to second-order algorithms’ performance. We thus study
  <em>AdamQLR</em>: an optimiser combining damping and learning rate selection techniques
  from K-FAC (Martens & Grosse, 2015) with the update directions proposed by Adam,
  inspired by considering Adam through a second-order lens. We evaluate AdamQLR on
  a range of regression and classification tasks at various scales and hyperparameter
  tuning methodologies, concluding K-FAC’s adaptive heuristics are of variable standalone
  general effectiveness, and finding an <em>untuned</em> AdamQLR setting can achieve
  comparable performance vs runtime to <em>tuned</em> benchmarks.'
