title: 'Rotational Equilibrium: How Weight Decay Balances Learning Across Neural Networks'
openreview: MQirNNU2pC
abstract: This study investigates how weight decay affects the update behavior of
  individual neurons in deep neural networks through a combination of applied analysis
  and experimentation. Weight decay can cause the expected magnitude and angular updates
  of a neuron’s weight vector to converge to a steady state we call rotational equilibrium.
  These states can be highly homogeneous, effectively balancing the average rotation—a
  proxy for the effective learning rate—across different layers and neurons. Our work
  analyzes these dynamics across optimizers like Adam, Lion, and SGD with momentum,
  offering a new simple perspective on training that elucidates the efficacy of widely
  used but poorly understood methods in deep learning. We demonstrate how balanced
  rotation plays a key role in the effectiveness of normalization like Weight Standardization,
  as well as that of AdamW over Adam with L2-regularization. Finally, we show that
  explicitly controlling the rotation provides the benefits of weight decay while
  substantially reducing the need for learning rate warmup.
