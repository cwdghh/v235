title: Incremental Topological Ordering and Cycle Detection with Predictions
openreview: wea7nsJdMc
abstract: 'This paper leverages the framework of algorithms-with-predictions to design
  data structures for two fundamental dynamic graph problems: incremental topological
  ordering and cycle detection. In these problems, the input is a directed graph on
  $n$ nodes, and the $m$ edges arrive one by one. The data structure must maintain
  a topological ordering of the vertices at all times and detect if the newly inserted
  edge creates a cycle. The theoretically best worst-case algorithms for these problems
  have high update cost (polynomial in $n$ and $m$). In practice, greedy heuristics
  (that recompute the solution from scratch each time) perform well but can have high
  update cost in the worst case. In this paper, we bridge this gap by leveraging predictions
  to design a learned new data structure for the problems. Our data structure guarantees
  consistency, robustness, and smoothness with respect to predictionsâ€”that is, it
  has the best possible running time under perfect predictions, never performs worse
  than the best-known worst-case methods, and its running time degrades smoothly with
  the prediction error. Moreover, we demonstrate empirically that predictions, learned
  from a very small training dataset, are sufficient to provide significant speed-ups
  on real datasets.'
