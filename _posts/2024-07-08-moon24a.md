title: A Simple Early Exiting Framework for Accelerated Sampling in Diffusion Models
openreview: OnOaj3g9fi
abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in generation problems
  over various domains including images, videos, text, and audio. A practical bottleneck
  of diffusion models is their sampling speed, due to the repeated evaluation of score
  estimation networks during the inference. In this work, we propose a novel framework
  capable of adaptively allocating compute required for the score estimation, thereby
  reducing the overall sampling time of diffusion models. We observe that the amount
  of computation required for the score estimation may vary along the time step for
  which the score is estimated. Based on this observation, we propose an early-exiting
  scheme, where we skip the subset of parameters in the score estimation network during
  the inference, based on a time-dependent exit schedule. Using the diffusion models
  for image synthesis, we show that our method could significantly improve the sampling
  throughput of the diffusion models without compromising image quality. Furthermore,
  we also demonstrate that our method seamlessly integrates with various types of
  solvers for faster sampling, capitalizing on their compatibility to enhance overall
  efficiency.
