title: Provable Privacy with Non-Private Pre-Processing
openreview: IzqpUC34Jg
abstract: 'When analyzing Differentially Private (DP) machine learning pipelines,
  the potential privacy cost of data-dependent pre-processing is frequently overlooked
  in privacy accounting. In this work, we propose a general framework to evaluate
  the additional privacy cost incurred by non-private data-dependent pre-processing
  algorithms. Our framework establishes upper bounds on the overall privacy guarantees
  by utilising two new technical notions: a variant of DP termed Smooth DP and the
  bounded sensitivity of the pre-processing algorithms. In addition to the generic
  framework, we provide explicit overall privacy guarantees for multiple data-dependent
  pre-processing algorithms, such as data imputation, quantization, deduplication,
  standard scaling and PCA, when used in combination with several DP algorithms. Notably,
  this framework is also simple to implement, allowing direct integration into existing
  DP pipelines.'
