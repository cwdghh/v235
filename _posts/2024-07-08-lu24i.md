title: 'CauDiTS: Causal Disentangled Domain Adaptation of Multivariate Time Series'
openreview: lsavZkUjFZ
abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation of multivariate time series aims to train
  a model to adapt its classification ability from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled
  target domain, where there are differences in the distribution between domains.
  Existing methods extract domain-invariant features directly via a shared feature
  extractor, neglecting the exploration of the underlying causal patterns, which undermines
  their reliability, especially in complex multivariate dynamic systems. To address
  this problem, we propose CauDiTS, an innovative framework for unsupervised domain
  adaptation of multivariate time series. CauDiTS adopts an adaptive rationale disentangler
  to disentangle domain-common causal rationales and domain-specific correlations
  from variable interrelationships. The stability of causal rationales across domains
  is vital for filtering domainspecific perturbations and facilitating the extraction
  of domain-invariant representations. Moreover, we promote the cross-domain consistency
  of intra-class causal rationales employing the learning strategies of causal prototype
  consistency and domain-intervention causality invariance. CauDiTS is evaluated on
  four benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and outperforming state-of-the-art
  methods.
