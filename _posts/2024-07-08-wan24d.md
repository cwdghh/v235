title: 'VinT-6D: A Large-Scale Object-in-hand Dataset from Vision, Touch and Proprioception'
openreview: 4G5Dcjcm1s
abstract: This paper addresses the scarcity of large-scale datasets for accurate object-in-hand
  pose estimation, which is crucial for robotic in-hand manipulation within the "Perception-Planning-Control"
  paradigm. Specifically, we introduce VinT-6D, the first extensive multi-modal dataset
  integrating vision, touch, and proprioception, to enhance robotic manipulation.
  VinT-6D comprises 2 million VinT-Sim and 0.1 million VinT-Real entries, collected
  via simulations in Mujoco and Blender and a custom-designed real-world platform.
  This dataset is tailored for robotic hands, offering models with whole-hand tactile
  perception and high-quality, well-aligned data. To the best of our knowledge, the
  VinT-Real is the largest considering the collection difficulties in the real-world
  environment so it can bridge the gap of simulation to real compared to the previous
  works. Built upon VinT-6D, we present a benchmark method that shows significant
  improvements in performance by fusing multi-modal information. The project is available
  at https://VinT-6D.github.io/.
