title: Stationary Latent Weight Inference for Unreliable Observations from Online
  Test-Time Adaptation
openreview: HmKMpJXH67
abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of online test-time adaptation (OTTA), effectively
  managing distribution shifts is a pivotal concern. State-of-the-art OTTA methodologies
  often face limitations such as an inadequate target domain information integration,
  leading to significant issues like catastrophic forgetting and a lack of adaptability
  in dynamically changing environments. In this paper, we introduce a stationary latent
  weight inference (SLWI) framework, a novel approach to overcome these challenges.
  The proposed SLWI uniquely incorporates Bayesian filtering to continually track
  and update the target model weights along with the source model weight in online
  settings, thereby ensuring that the adapted model remains responsive to ongoing
  changes in the target domain. The proposed framework has the peculiar property to
  identify and backtrack nonlinear weights that exhibit local non-stationarity, thereby
  mitigating error propagation, a common pitfall of previous approaches. By integrating
  and refining information from both source and target domains, SLWI presents a robust
  solution to the persistent issue of domain adaptation in OTTA, significantly improving
  existing methodologies. The efficacy of SLWI is demonstrated through various experimental
  setups, showcasing its superior performance in diverse distribution shift scenarios.
