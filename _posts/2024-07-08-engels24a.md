title: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search with Window Filters
openreview: 8t8zBaGFar
abstract: 'We define and investigate the problem of <em>c-approximate window search</em>:
  approximate nearest neighbor search where each point in the dataset has a numeric
  label, and the goal is to find nearest neighbors to queries within arbitrary label
  ranges. Many semantic search problems, such as image and document search with timestamp
  filters, or product search with cost filters, are natural examples of this problem.
  We propose and theoretically analyze a modular tree-based framework for transforming
  an index that solves the traditional c-approximate nearest neighbor problem into
  a data structure that solves window search. On standard nearest neighbor benchmark
  datasets equipped with random label values, adversarially constructed embeddings,
  and image search embeddings with real timestamps, we obtain up to a $75\times$ speedup
  over existing solutions at the same level of recall.'
