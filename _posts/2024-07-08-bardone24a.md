title: 'Sliding Down the Stairs: How Correlated Latent Variables Accelerate Learning
  with Neural Networks'
openreview: 9iGdh0wAgB
abstract: 'Neural networks extract features from data using stochastic gradient descent
  (SGD). In particular, higher-order input cumulants (HOCs) are crucial for their
  performance. However, extracting information from the $p$th cumulant of $d$-dimensional
  inputs is computationally hard: the number of samples required to recover a single
  direction from an order-$p$ tensor (tensor PCA) using SGD grows as $d^{pâˆ’1}$, which
  is prohibitive for high-dimensional inputs. This result raises the question of how
  neural networks extract relevant directions from the HOCs of their inputs efficiently.
  Here, we show that correlations between latent variables along the directions encoded
  in different input cumulants speed up learning from higher-order correlations. We
  show this effect analytically by deriving nearly sharp thresholds for the number
  of samples required by a single neuron to recover these directions using online
  SGD from a random start in high dimensions. Our analytical results are confirmed
  in simulations of two-layer neural networks and unveil a new mechanism for hierarchical
  learning in neural networks'
