title: 'Rethinking Guidance Information to Utilize Unlabeled Samples: A Label Encoding
  Perspective'
openreview: yoTCwNqQS6
abstract: Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) is fragile in scenarios with insufficient
  labeled samples. A vanilla extension of ERM to unlabeled samples is Entropy Minimization
  (EntMin), which employs the soft-labels of unlabeled samples to guide their learning.
  However, EntMin emphasizes prediction discriminability while neglecting prediction
  diversity. To alleviate this issue, in this paper, we rethink the guidance information
  to utilize unlabeled samples. By analyzing the learning objective of ERM, we find
  that the guidance information for labeled samples in a specific category is the
  corresponding <em>label encoding</em>. Inspired by this finding, we propose a Label-Encoding
  Risk Minimization (LERM). It first estimates the label encodings through prediction
  means of unlabeled samples and then aligns them with their corresponding ground-truth
  label encodings. As a result, the LERM ensures both prediction discriminability
  and diversity, and it can be integrated into existing methods as a plugin. Theoretically,
  we analyze the relationships between LERM and ERM as well as EntMin. Empirically,
  we verify the superiority of the LERM under several label insufficient scenarios.
