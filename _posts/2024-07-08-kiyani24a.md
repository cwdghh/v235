title: Conformal Prediction with Learned Features
openreview: YPbcUBcTAk
abstract: In this paper, we focus on the problem of conformal prediction with conditional
  guarantees. Prior work has shown that it is impossible to construct nontrivial prediction
  sets with full conditional coverage guarantees. A wealth of research has considered
  relaxations of full conditional guarantees, relying on some <em>predefined</em>
  uncertainty structures. Departing from this line of thinking, we propose Partition
  Learning Conformal Prediction (PLCP), a framework to improve conditional validity
  of prediction sets through <em>learning</em> uncertainty-guided features from the
  calibration data. We implement PLCP efficiently with alternating gradient descent,
  utilizing off-the-shelf machine learning models. We further analyze PLCP theoretically
  and provide conditional guarantees for infinite and finite sample sizes. Finally,
  our experimental results over four real-world and synthetic datasets show the superior
  performance of PLCP compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of coverage and
  length in both classification and regression scenarios.
