title: Reducing Balancing Error for Causal Inference via Optimal Transport
openreview: GktjBAGgo4
abstract: Most studies on causal inference tackle the issue of confounding bias by
  reducing the distribution shift between the control and treated groups. However,
  it remains an open question to adopt an appropriate metric for distribution shift
  in practice. In this paper, we define a generic balancing error on reweighted samples
  to characterize the confounding bias, and study the connection between the balancing
  error and the Wasserstein discrepancy derived from the theory of optimal transport.
  We not only regard the Wasserstein discrepancy as the metric of distribution shift,
  but also explore the association between the balancing error and the underlying
  cost function involved in the Wasserstein discrepancy. Motivated by this, we propose
  to reduce the balancing error under the framework of optimal transport with learnable
  marginal distributions and the cost function, which is implemented by jointly learning
  weights and representations associated with factual outcomes. The experiments on
  both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
  method.
