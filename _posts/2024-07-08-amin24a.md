title: Scalable and Flexible Causal Discovery with an Efficient Test for Adjacency
openreview: 5M4Qa9AqY7
abstract: To make accurate predictions, understand mechanisms, and design interventions
  in systems of many variables, we wish to learn causal graphs from large scale data.
  Unfortunately the space of all possible causal graphs is enormous so scalably and
  accurately searching for the best fit to the data is a challenge. In principle we
  could substantially decrease the search space, or learn the graph entirely, by testing
  the conditional independence of variables. However, deciding if two variables are
  adjacent in a causal graph may require an exponential number of tests. Here we build
  a scalable and flexible method to evaluate if two variables are adjacent in a causal
  graph, the Differentiable Adjacency Test (DAT). DAT replaces an exponential number
  of tests with a provably equivalent relaxed problem. It then solves this problem
  by training two neural networks. We build a graph learning method based on DAT,
  DAT-Graph, that can also learn from data with interventions. DAT-Graph can learn
  graphs of 1000 variables with state of the art accuracy. Using the graph learned
  by DAT-Graph, we also build models that make much more accurate predictions of the
  effects of interventions on large scale RNA sequencing data.
