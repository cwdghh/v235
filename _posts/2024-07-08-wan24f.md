title: Superpoint Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time High-Fidelity Dynamic Scene Reconstruction
openreview: INb8xV1xmf
abstract: Rendering novel view images in dynamic scenes is a crucial yet challenging
  task. Current methods mainly utilize NeRF-based methods to represent the static
  scene and an additional time-variant MLP to model scene deformations, resulting
  in relatively low rendering quality as well as slow inference speed. To tackle these
  challenges, we propose a novel framework named Superpoint Gaussian Splatting (SP-GS).
  Specifically, our framework first employs explicit 3D Gaussians to reconstruct the
  scene and then clusters Gaussians with similar properties (e.g., rotation, translation,
  and location) into superpoints. Empowered by these superpoints, our method manages
  to extend 3D Gaussian splatting to dynamic scenes with only a slight increase in
  computational expense. Apart from achieving state-of-the-art visual quality and
  real-time rendering under high resolutions, the superpoint representation provides
  a stronger manipulation capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the practicality
  and effectiveness of our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Please
