title: Image Clustering with External Guidance
openreview: JSYN891WnB
abstract: The core of clustering lies in incorporating prior knowledge to construct
  supervision signals. From classic k-means based on data compactness to recent contrastive
  clustering guided by self-supervision, the evolution of clustering methods intrinsically
  corresponds to the progression of supervision signals. At present, substantial efforts
  have been devoted to mining internal supervision signals from data. Nevertheless,
  the abundant external knowledge such as semantic descriptions, which naturally conduces
  to clustering, is regrettably overlooked. In this work, we propose leveraging external
  knowledge as a new supervision signal to guide clustering. To implement and validate
  our idea, we design an externally guided clustering method (Text-Aided Clustering,
  TAC), which leverages the textual semantics of WordNet to facilitate image clustering.
  Specifically, TAC first selects and retrieves WordNet nouns that best distinguish
  images to enhance the feature discriminability. Then, TAC collaborates text and
  image modalities by mutually distilling cross-modal neighborhood information. Experiments
  demonstrate that TAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on five widely used and
  three more challenging image clustering benchmarks, including the full ImageNet-1K
  dataset. The code can be accessed at https://github.com/XLearning-SCU/2024-ICML-TAC.
