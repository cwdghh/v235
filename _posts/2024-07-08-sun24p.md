title: 'BBox-Adapter: Lightweight Adapting for Black-Box Large Language Models'
openreview: jdRIaUu3xY
abstract: Adapting state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Gemini
  for specific tasks is challenging. Due to the opacity in their parameters, embeddings,
  and even output probabilities, existing fine-tuning adaptation methods are inapplicable.
  Consequently, adapting these black-box LLMs is only possible through their API services,
  raising concerns about transparency, privacy, and cost. To address these challenges,
  we introduce BBox-Adapter, a novel lightweight adapter for black-box LLMs. BBox-Adapter
  distinguishes target and source domain data by treating target data as positive
  and source data as negative. It employs a ranking-based Noise Contrastive Estimation
  (NCE) loss to promote the likelihood of target domain data while penalizing that
  of the source domain. Furthermore, it features an online adaptation mechanism, which
  incorporates real-time positive data sampling from ground-truth, human, or AI feedback,
  coupled with negative data from previous adaptations. Extensive experiments demonstrate
  BBox-Adapterâ€™s effectiveness and cost efficiency. It improves model performance
  by up to 6.77% across diverse tasks and domains, while reducing training and inference
  costs by 31.30x and 1.84x, respectively.
