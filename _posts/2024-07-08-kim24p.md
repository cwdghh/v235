title: Clustered Federated Learning via Gradient-based Partitioning
openreview: J4HJUF70qm
abstract: Clustered Federated Learning (CFL) is a promising distributed learning framework
  that addresses data heterogeneity issues across multiple clients by grouping clients
  and providing a shared generalized model for each group. However, under privacy-preserving
  federated learning protocols where there is no direct sharing of clientsâ€™ local
  datasets, existing approaches often fail to find optimal client groupings resulting
  in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel CFL algorithm that
  achieves robust clustering and learning performance. Conceptually, our algorithm
  groups clients that exhibit similarity in their model updates by periodically accumulating
  and clustering the gradients that clients compute for various models. The proposed
  algorithm is shown to achieve a near-optimal error rate for stochastic convergence
  to optimal models under mild conditions. We present a detailed analysis of the algorithm
  along with an evaluation on several CFL benchmarks demonstrating that it outperforms
  existing approaches in terms of convergence speed, clustering accuracy, and task
  performance.
