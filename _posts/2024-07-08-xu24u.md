title: Adaptive Group Personalization for Federated Mutual Transfer Learning
openreview: DqC9XiI71U
abstract: Mutual transfer learning aims to improve prediction with knowledge from
  related domains. Recently, federated learning is applied in this field to address
  the communication and privacy concerns. However, previous clustered federated learning
  (CFL) solutions lack theoretical guarantee of learnability recovery and require
  time-consuming hyper-parameter tuning, while centralized mutual transfer learning
  methods lack adaptability to concept drifts. In this paper, we propose the Adaptive
  Group Personalization method (<b>AdaGrP</b>) to overcome these challenges. We adaptively
  decide the recovery threshold with a nonparametric method, <em>adaptive threshold
  correction</em>, for tuning-free solution with relaxed condition. Theoretical results
  guarantee the perfect learnability recovery with the corrected threshold. Empirical
  results show AdaGrP achieves 16.9% average improvement in learnability structure
  recovery compared with state-of-the-art CFL baselines.
