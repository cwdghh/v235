title: 'StackSight: Unveiling WebAssembly through Large Language Models and Neurosymbolic
  Chain-of-Thought Decompilation'
openreview: gn5AsHIIwb
abstract: WebAssembly enables near-native execution in web applications and is increasingly
  adopted for tasks that demand high performance and robust security. However, its
  assembly-like syntax, implicit stack machine, and low-level data types make it extremely
  difficult for human developers to understand, spurring the need for effective WebAssembly
  reverse engineering techniques. In this paper, we propose StackSight, a novel neurosymbolic
  approach that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with advanced program analysis
  to decompile complex WebAssembly code into readable C++ snippets. StackSight visualizes
  and tracks virtual stack alterations via a static analysis algorithm and then applies
  chain-of-thought prompting to harness LLMâ€™s complex reasoning capabilities. Evaluation
  results show that StackSight significantly improves WebAssembly decompilation. Our
  user study also demonstrates that code snippets generated by StackSight have significantly
  higher win rates and enable a better grasp of code semantics.
