title: 'LIDAO: Towards Limited Interventions for Debiasing (Large) Language Models'
openreview: NsHxeSCtgr
abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on various
  natural language generation tasks. Nonetheless, they suffer from generating negative
  and harmful contents that are biased against certain demographic groups (e.g., female),
  raising severe fairness concerns. As remedies, prior works intervened the generation
  by removing attitude or demographic information, inevitably degrading the generation
  quality and resulting in notable <em>fairness-fluency</em> trade-offs. However,
  it is still under-explored to what extent the fluency <em>has to</em> be affected
  in order to achieve a desired level of fairness. In this work, we conduct the first
  formal study from an information-theoretic perspective. We show that previous approaches
  are excessive for debiasing and propose LIDAO, a general framework to debias a (L)LM
  at a better fluency provably. We further robustify LIDAO in adversarial scenarios,
  where a carefully-crafted prompt may stimulate LLMs exhibiting instruction-following
  abilities to generate texts with fairness issue appears only when the prompt is
  also taken into account. Experiments on three LMs ranging from 0.7B to 7B parameters
  demonstrate the superiority of our method.
