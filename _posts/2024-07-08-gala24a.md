title: Leverage Class-Specific Accuracy to Guide Data Generation for Improving Image
  Classification
openreview: KHymcy2xxF
abstract: In many image classification applications, the number of labeled training
  images is limited, which leads to model overfitting. To mitigate the lack of training
  data, deep generative models have been leveraged to generate synthetic training
  data. However, existing methods generate data for individual classes based on how
  much training data they have without considering their actual data needs. To address
  this limitation, we propose needs-aware image generation, which automatically identifies
  the different data needs of individual classes based on their classification performance
  and divides a limited data generation budget into these classes according to their
  needs. We propose a multi-level optimization based framework which performs four
  learning stages in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on both imbalanced and balanced
  classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
