title: Autonomous Sparse Mean-CVaR Portfolio Optimization
openreview: 0NacraIYrA
abstract: The $\ell_0$-constrained mean-CVaR model poses a significant challenge due
  to its NP-hard nature, typically tackled through combinatorial methods characterized
  by high computational demands. From a markedly different perspective, we propose
  an innovative autonomous sparse mean-CVaR portfolio model, capable of approximating
  the original $\ell_0$-constrained mean-CVaR model with arbitrary accuracy. The core
  idea is to convert the $\ell_0$ constraint into an indicator function and subsequently
  handle it through a tailed approximation. We then propose a proximal alternating
  linearized minimization algorithm, coupled with a nested fixed-point proximity algorithm
  (both convergent), to iteratively solve the model. Autonomy in sparsity refers to
  retaining a significant portion of assets within the selected asset pool during
  adjustments in pool size. Consequently, our framework offers a theoretically guaranteed
  approximation of the $\ell_0$-constrained mean-CVaR model, improving computational
  efficiency while providing a robust asset selection scheme.
