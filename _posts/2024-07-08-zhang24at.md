title: In-Context Principle Learning from Mistakes
openreview: PAPY0cAB3C
abstract: 'In-context learning (ICL, also known as few-shot prompting) has been the
  standard method of adapting LLMs to downstream tasks, by learning from a few input-output
  examples. Nonetheless, all ICL-based approaches only learn from correct input-output
  pairs. In this paper, we revisit this paradigm, by learning more from the few given
  input-output examples. We introduce Learning Principles (LEAP): First, we intentionally
  induce the model to make mistakes on these few examples; then we reflect on these
  mistakes, and learn explicit task-specific “principles” from them, which help solve
  similar problems and avoid common mistakes; finally, we prompt the model to answer
  unseen test questions using the original few-shot examples and these learned general
  principles. We evaluate LEAP on a wide range of benchmarks, including multi-hop
  question answering (Hotpot QA), textual QA (DROP), Big-Bench Hard reasoning, and
  math problems (GSM8K and MATH); in all these benchmarks, LEAP improves the strongest
  available LLMs such as GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo and Claude-2.1. For example,
  LEAP improves over the standard few-shot prompting using GPT-4 by 7.5% in DROP,
  and by 3.3% in HotpotQA. Importantly, LEAP does not require any more input or examples
  than the standard few-shot prompting settings.'
