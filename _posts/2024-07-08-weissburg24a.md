title: 'Position: AI/ML Influencers Have a Place in the Academic Process'
openreview: yo9Jyt3XCY
abstract: As the number of accepted papers at AI and ML conferences reaches into the
  thousands, it has become unclear how researchers access and read research publications.
  In this paper, we investigate the role of social media influencers in enhancing
  the visibility of machine learning research, particularly the citation counts of
  papers they share. We have compiled a comprehensive dataset of over 8,000 papers,
  spanning tweets from December 2018 to October 2023, alongside controls precisely
  matched by 9 key covariates. Our statistical and causal inference analysis reveals
  a significant increase in citations for papers endorsed by these influencers, with
  median citation counts 2-3 times higher than those of the control group. Additionally,
  the study delves into the geographic, gender, and institutional diversity of highlighted
  authors. Given these findings, we advocate for a responsible approach to curation,
  encouraging influencers to uphold the journalistic standard that includes showcasing
  diverse research topics, authors, and institutions.
