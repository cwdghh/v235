title: 'DRCT: Diffusion Reconstruction Contrastive Training towards Universal Detection
  of Diffusion Generated Images'
openreview: oRLwyayrh1
abstract: Diffusion models have made significant strides in visual content generation
  but also raised increasing demands on generated image detection. Existing detection
  methods have achieved considerable progress, but they usually suffer a significant
  decline in accuracy when detecting images generated by an unseen diffusion model.
  In this paper, we seek to address the generalizability of generated image detectors
  from the perspective of hard sample classification. The basic idea is that if a
  classifier can distinguish generated images that closely resemble real ones, then
  it can also effectively detect less similar samples, potentially even those produced
  by a different diffusion model. Based on this idea, we propose Diffusion Reconstruction
  Contrastive Learning (DRCT), a universal framework to enhance the generalizability
  of the existing detectors. DRCT generates hard samples by high-quality diffusion
  reconstruction and adopts contrastive training to guide the learning of diffusion
  artifacts. In addition, we have built a million-scale dataset, DRCT-2M, including
  16 types diffusion models for the evaluation of generalizability of detection methods.
  Extensive experimental results show that detectors enhanced with DRCT achieve over
  a 10% accuracy improvement in cross-set tests. The code, models, and dataset will
  soon be available at https://github.com/beibuwandeluori/DRCT.
