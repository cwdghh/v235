title: 'MVMoE: Multi-Task Vehicle Routing Solver with Mixture-of-Experts'
openreview: lsQnneYa8p
abstract: 'Learning to solve vehicle routing problems (VRPs) has garnered much attention.
  However, most neural solvers are only structured and trained independently on a
  specific problem, making them less generic and practical. In this paper, we aim
  to develop a unified neural solver that can cope with a range of VRP variants simultaneously.
  Specifically, we propose a multi-task vehicle routing solver with mixture-of-experts
  (MVMoE), which greatly enhances the model capacity without a proportional increase
  in computation. We further develop a hierarchical gating mechanism for the MVMoE,
  delivering a good trade-off between empirical performance and computational complexity.
  Experimentally, our method significantly promotes zero-shot generalization performance
  on 10 unseen VRP variants, and showcases decent results on the few-shot setting
  and real-world benchmark instances. We further conduct extensive studies on the
  effect of MoE configurations in solving VRPs, and observe the superiority of hierarchical
  gating when facing out-of-distribution data. The source code is available at: https://github.com/RoyalSkye/Routing-MVMoE.'
