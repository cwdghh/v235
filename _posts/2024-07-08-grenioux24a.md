title: Stochastic Localization via Iterative Posterior Sampling
openreview: 2Gr5wZR6uc
abstract: Building upon score-based learning, new interest in stochastic localization
  techniques has recently emerged. In these models, one seeks to noise a sample from
  the data distribution through a stochastic process, called observation process,
  and progressively learns a denoiser associated to this dynamics. Apart from specific
  applications, the use of stochastic localization for the problem of sampling from
  an unnormalized target density has not been explored extensively. This work contributes
  to fill this gap. We consider a general stochastic localization framework and introduce
  an explicit class of observation processes, associated with flexible denoising schedules.
  We provide a complete methodology, <em>Stochastic Localization via Iterative Posterior
  Sampling</em> (<b>SLIPS</b>), to obtain approximate samples of these dynamics, and
  as a by-product, samples from the target distribution. Our scheme is based on a
  Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation of the denoiser and comes with detailed practical
  guidelines. We illustrate the benefits and applicability of <b>SLIPS</b> on several
  benchmarks of multi-modal distributions, including Gaussian mixtures in increasing
  dimensions, Bayesian logistic regression and a high-dimensional field system from
  statistical-mechanics.
