title: Centralized Selection with Preferences in the Presence of Biases
openreview: 9QRcp2ubDt
abstract: This paper considers the scenario in which there are multiple institutions,
  each with a limited capacity for candidates, and candidates, each with preferences
  over the institutions. A central entity evaluates the utility of each candidate
  to the institutions, and the goal is to select candidates for each institution in
  a way that maximizes utility while also considering the candidates’ preferences.
  The paper focuses on the setting in which candidates are divided into multiple groups
  and the observed utilities of candidates in some groups are biased–systematically
  lower than their true utilities. The first result is that, in these biased settings,
  prior algorithms can lead to selections with sub-optimal true utility and significant
  discrepancies in the fraction of candidates from each group that get their preferred
  choices. Subsequently, an algorithm is presented along with proof that it produces
  selections that achieve near-optimal group fairness with respect to preferences
  while also nearly maximizing the true utility under distributional assumptions.
  Further, extensive empirical validation of these results in real-world and synthetic
  settings, in which the distributional assumptions may not hold, are presented.
