title: Simulation-Based Inference with Quantile Regression
openreview: vGHOFeUQi8
abstract: We present Neural Quantile Estimation (NQE), a novel Simulation-Based Inference
  (SBI) method based on conditional quantile regression. NQE autoregressively learns
  individual one dimensional quantiles for each posterior dimension, conditioned on
  the data and previous posterior dimensions. Posterior samples are obtained by interpolating
  the predicted quantiles using monotonic cubic Hermite spline, with specific treatment
  for the tail behavior and multi-modal distributions. We introduce an alternative
  definition for the Bayesian credible region using the local Cumulative Density Function
  (CDF), offering substantially faster evaluation than the traditional Highest Posterior
  Density Region (HPDR). In case of limited simulation budget and/or known model misspecification,
  a post-processing calibration step can be integrated into NQE to ensure the unbiasedness
  of the posterior estimation with negligible additional computational cost. We demonstrate
  that NQE achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmark problems.
