  InfoNCE to Kernel-Based Losses'

abstract: What do different contrastive learning (CL) losses actually optimize for?
  Although multiple CL methods have demonstrated remarkable representation learning
  capabilities, the differences in their inner workings remain largely opaque. In
  this work, we analyse several CL families and prove that, under certain conditions,
  they admit the same minimisers when optimizing either their batch-level objectives
  or their expectations asymptotically. In both cases, an intimate connection with
  the hyperspherical energy minimisation (HEM) problem resurfaces. Drawing inspiration
  from this, we introduce a novel CL objective, coined Decoupled Hyperspherical Energy
  Loss (DHEL). DHEL simplifies the problem by decoupling the target hyperspherical
  energy from the alignment of positive examples while preserving the same theoretical
  guarantees. Going one step further, we show the same results hold for another relevant
  CL family, namely kernel contrastive learning (KCL), with the additional advantage
  of the expected loss being independent of batch size, thus identifying the minimisers
  in the non-asymptotic regime. Empirical results demonstrate improved downstream
  performance and robustness across combinations of different batch sizes and hyperparameters
  and reduced dimensionality collapse, on several computer vision datasets.
