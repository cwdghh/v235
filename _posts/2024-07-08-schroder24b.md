title: Simultaneous identification of models and parameters of scientific simulators
openreview: xC7SYAZygF
abstract: 'Many scientific models are composed of multiple discrete components, and
  scientists often make heuristic decisions about which components to include. Bayesian
  inference provides a mathematical framework for systematically selecting model components,
  but defining prior distributions over model components and developing associated
  inference schemes has been challenging. We approach this problem in a simulation-based
  inference framework: We define model priors over candidate components and, from
  model simulations, train neural networks to infer joint probability distributions
  over both model components and associated parameters. Our method, simulation-based
  model inference (SBMI), represents distributions over model components as a conditional
  mixture of multivariate binary distributions in the Grassmann formalism. SBMI can
  be applied to any compositional stochastic simulator without requiring likelihood
  evaluations. We evaluate SBMI on a simple time series model and on two scientific
  models from neuroscience, and show that it can discover multiple data-consistent
  model configurations, and that it reveals non-identifiable model components and
  parameters. SBMI provides a powerful tool for data-driven scientific inquiry which
  will allow scientists to identify essential model components and make uncertainty-informed
  modelling decisions.'
