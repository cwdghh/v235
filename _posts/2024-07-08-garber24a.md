title: Projection-Free Online Convex Optimization with Time-Varying Constraints
openreview: RnbobOgbn0
abstract: We consider the setting of online convex optimization with adversarial time-varying
  constraints in which actions must be feasible w.r.t. a fixed constraint set, and
  are also required on average to approximately satisfy additional time-varying constraints.
  Motivated by scenarios in which the fixed feasible set (hard constraint) is difficult
  to project on, we consider projection-free algorithms that access this set only
  through a linear optimization oracle (LOO). We present an algorithm that, on a sequence
  of length $T$ and using overall $T$ calls to the LOO, guarantees $\tilde{O}(T^{3/4})$
  regret w.r.t. the losses and $O(T^{7/8})$ constraints violation (ignoring all quantities
  except for $T$). In particular, these bounds hold w.r.t. any interval of the sequence.
  This algorithm however also requires access to an oracle for minimizing a strongly
  convex nonsmooth function over a Euclidean ball. We present a more efficient algorithm
  that does not require the latter optimization oracle but only first-order access
  to the time-varying constraints, and achieves similar bounds w.r.t. the entire sequence.
  We extend the latter to the setting of bandit feedback and obtain similar bounds
  (as a function of $T$) in expectation.
