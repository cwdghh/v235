title: 'LAGMA: LAtent Goal-guided Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning'
openreview: gtYdvSGMYV
abstract: 'In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), agents collaborate
  to achieve common goals, such as defeating enemies and scoring a goal. However,
  learning goal-reaching paths toward such a semantic goal takes a considerable amount
  of time in complex tasks and the trained model often fails to find such paths. To
  address this, we present LAtent Goal-guided Multi-Agent reinforcement learning (LAGMA),
  which generates a goal-reaching trajectory in latent space and provides a latent
  goal-guided incentive to transitions toward this reference trajectory. LAGMA consists
  of three major components: (a) quantized latent space constructed via a modified
  VQ-VAE for efficient sample utilization, (b) goal-reaching trajectory generation
  via extended VQ codebook, and (c) latent goal-guided intrinsic reward generation
  to encourage transitions towards the sampled goal-reaching path. The proposed method
  is evaluated by StarCraft II with both dense and sparse reward settings and Google
  Research Football. Empirical results show further performance improvement over state-of-the-art
  baselines.'
