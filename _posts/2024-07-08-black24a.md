title: 'Biharmonic Distance of Graphs and its Higher-Order Variants: Theoretical Properties
  with Applications to Centrality and Clustering'
openreview: 3pxMIjB9QK
abstract: Effective resistance is a distance between vertices of a graph that is both
  theoretically interesting and useful in applications. We study a variant of effective
  resistance called the biharmonic distance. While the effective resistance measures
  how well-connected two vertices are, we prove several theoretical results supporting
  the idea that the biharmonic distance measures how important an edge is to the global
  topology of the graph. Our theoretical results connect the biharmonic distance to
  well-known measures of connectivity of a graph like its total resistance and sparsity.
  Based on these results, we introduce two clustering algorithms using the biharmonic
  distance. Finally, we introduce a further generalization of the biharmonic distance
  that we call the $k$-harmonic distance. We empirically study the utility of biharmonic
  and $k$-harmonic distance for edge centrality and graph clustering.
