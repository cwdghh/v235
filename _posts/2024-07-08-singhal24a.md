title: What’s the score? Automated Denoising Score Matching for Nonlinear Diffusions
openreview: wLoESsgZIq
abstract: Reversing a diffusion process by learning its score forms the heart of diffusion-based
  generative modeling and for estimating properties of scientific systems. The diffusion
  processes that are tractable center on linear processes with a Gaussian stationary
  distribution, limiting the kinds of models that can be built to those that target
  a Gaussian prior or more generally limits the kinds of problems that can be generically
  solved to those that have conditionally linear score functions. In this work, we
  introduce a family of tractable denoising score matching objectives, called local-DSM,
  built using local increments of the diffusion process. We show how local-DSM melded
  with Taylor expansions enables automated training and score estimation with nonlinear
  diffusion processes. To demonstrate these ideas, we use automated-DSM to train generative
  models using non-Gaussian priors on challenging low dimensional distributions and
  the CIFAR10 image dataset. Additionally, we use the automated-DSM to learn the scores
  for nonlinear processes studied in statistical physics.
