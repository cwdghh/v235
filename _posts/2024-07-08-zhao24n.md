title: A Statistical Theory of Regularization-Based Continual Learning
openreview: A54CXWn9VB
abstract: We provide a statistical analysis of regularization-based continual learning
  on a sequence of linear regression tasks, with emphasis on how different regularization
  terms affect the model performance. We first derive the convergence rate for the
  oracle estimator obtained as if all data were available simultaneously. Next, we
  consider a family of generalized $\ell_2$-regularization algorithms indexed by matrix-valued
  hyperparameters, which includes the minimum norm estimator and continual ridge regression
  as special cases. As more tasks are introduced, we derive an iterative update formula
  for the estimation error of generalized $\ell_2$-regularized estimators, from which
  we determine the hyperparameters resulting in the optimal algorithm. Interestingly,
  the choice of hyperparameters can effectively balance the trade-off between forward
  and backward knowledge transfer and adjust for data heterogeneity. Moreover, the
  estimation error of the optimal algorithm is derived explicitly, which is of the
  same order as that of the oracle estimator. In contrast, our lower bounds for the
  minimum norm estimator and continual ridge regression show their suboptimality.
  A byproduct of our theoretical analysis is the equivalence between early stopping
  and generalized $\ell_2$-regularization in continual learning, which may be of independent
  interest. Finally, we conduct experiments to complement our theory.
