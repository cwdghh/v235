title: 'Multi-Region Markovian Gaussian Process: An Efficient Method to Discover Directional
  Communications Across Multiple Brain Regions'
openreview: us6zMORsMe
abstract: Studying the complex interactions between different brain regions is crucial
  in neuroscience. Various statistical methods have explored the latent communication
  across multiple brain regions. Two main categories are the Gaussian Process (GP)
  and Linear Dynamical System (LDS), each with unique strengths. The GP-based approach
  effectively discovers latent variables with frequency bands and communication directions.
  Conversely, the LDS-based approach is computationally efficient but lacks powerful
  expressiveness in latent representation. In this study, we merge both methodologies
  by creating an LDS mirroring a multi-output GP, termed Multi-Region Markovian Gaussian
  Process (MRM-GP). Our work establishes a connection between an LDS and a multi-output
  GP that explicitly models frequencies and phase delays within the latent space of
  neural recordings. Consequently, the model achieves a linear inference cost over
  time points and provides an interpretable low-dimensional representation, revealing
  communication directions across brain regions and separating oscillatory communications
  into different frequency bands.
