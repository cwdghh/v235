title: Symmetric Matrix Completion with ReLU Sampling
openreview: VxI0gInNlh
abstract: 'We study the problem of symmetric positive semi-definite low-rank matrix
  completion (MC) with deterministic entry-dependent sampling. In particular, we consider
  rectified linear unit (ReLU) sampling, where only positive entries are observed,
  as well as a generalization to threshold-based sampling. We first empirically demonstrate
  that the landscape of this MC problem is not globally benign: Gradient descent (GD)
  with random initialization will generally converge to stationary points that are
  not globally optimal. Nevertheless, we prove that when the matrix factor with a
  small rank satisfies mild assumptions, the nonconvex objective function is geodesically
  strongly convex on the quotient manifold in a neighborhood of a planted low-rank
  matrix. Moreover, we show that our assumptions are satisfied by a matrix factor
  with i.i.d. Gaussian entries. Finally, we develop a tailor-designed initialization
  for GD to solve our studied formulation, which empirically always achieves convergence
  to the global minima. We also conduct extensive experiments and compare MC methods,
  investigating convergence and completion performance with respect to initialization,
  noise level, dimension, and rank.'
