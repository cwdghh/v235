title: 'Position: Foundation Agents as the Paradigm Shift for Decision Making'
openreview: jzHmElqpPe
abstract: Decision making demands intricate interplay between perception, memory,
  and reasoning to discern optimal policies. Conventional approaches to decision making
  face challenges related to low sample efficiency and poor generalization. In contrast,
  foundation models in language and vision have showcased rapid adaptation to diverse
  new tasks. Therefore, we advocate for the construction of foundation agents as a
  transformative shift in the learning paradigm of agents. This proposal is underpinned
  by the formulation of foundation agents with their fundamental characteristics and
  challenges motivated by the success of large language models (LLMs). Moreover, we
  specify the roadmap of foundation agents from large interactive data collection
  or generation, to self-supervised pretraining and adaptation, and knowledge and
  value alignment with LLMs. Lastly, we pinpoint critical research questions derived
  from the formulation and delineate trends for foundation agents supported by real-world
  use cases, addressing both technical and theoretical aspects to propel the field
  towards a more comprehensive and impactful future.
