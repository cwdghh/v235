title: Smoothness Adaptive Hypothesis Transfer Learning
openreview: v0VUsQI5yw
abstract: Many existing two-phase kernel-based hypothesis transfer learning algorithms
  employ the same kernel regularization across phases and rely on the known smoothness
  of functions to obtain optimality. Therefore, they fail to adapt to the varying
  and unknown smoothness between the target/source and their offset. This paper introduces
  Smoothness Adaptive Transfer Learning (SATL), a two-phase kernel ridge regression
  (KRR)-based algorithm to address these limitations. We first demonstrate that employing
  a misspecified fixed bandwidth Gaussian kernel in target-only KRR learning can achieve
  minimax optimality when the true function resides in Sobolev spaces. Leveraging
  this result, SATL enables the estimators to provably and universally adapt to the
  varying and unknown Sobolev smoothness of the source and offset functions. We derive
  the minimax lower bound of the learning problem in excess risk and show that SATL
  achieves a matching upper bound up to logarithmic factors. The optimal statistical
  rate reveals the factors influencing the transfer dynamics and efficacy, including
  the source sample size and the relative strength between domains. The theoretical
  findings and the effectiveness of SATL are confirmed by several experiments.
