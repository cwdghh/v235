title: On the Error-Propagation of Inexact Hotelling’s Deflation for Principal Component
  Analysis
openreview: 8dX4YnosqG
abstract: 'Principal Component Analysis (PCA) aims to find subspaces spanned by the
  so-called <em>principal components</em> that best represent the variance in the
  dataset. The deflation method is a popular meta-algorithm that sequentially finds
  individual principal components, starting from the most important ones and working
  towards the less important ones. However, as deflation proceeds, numerical errors
  from the imprecise estimation of principal components propagate due to its sequential
  nature. This paper mathematically characterizes the error propagation of the inexact
  Hotelling’s deflation method. We consider two scenarios: $i)$ when the sub-routine
  for finding the leading eigenvector is abstract and can represent various algorithms;
  and $ii)$ when power iteration is used as the sub-routine. In the latter case, the
  additional directional information from power iteration allows us to obtain a tighter
  error bound than the sub-routine agnostic case. For both scenarios, we explicitly
  characterize how the errors progress and affect subsequent principal component estimations.'
