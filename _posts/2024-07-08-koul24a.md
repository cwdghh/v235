title: 'PcLast: Discovering Plannable Continuous Latent States'
openreview: AaTYLZQPyC
abstract: Goal-conditioned planning benefits from learned low-dimensional representations
  of rich observations. While compact latent representations typically learned from
  variational autoencoders or inverse dynamics enable goal-conditioned decision making,
  they ignore state reachability, hampering their performance. In this paper, we learn
  a representation that associates reachable states together for effective planning
  and goal-conditioned policy learning. We first learn a latent representation with
  multi-step inverse dynamics (to remove distracting information), and then transform
  this representation to associate reachable states together in $\ell_2$ space. Our
  proposals are rigorously tested in various simulation testbeds. Numerical results
  in reward-based settings show significant improvements in sampling efficiency. Further,
  in reward-free settings this approach yields layered state abstractions that enable
  computationally efficient hierarchical planning for reaching ad hoc goals with zero
  additional samples.
