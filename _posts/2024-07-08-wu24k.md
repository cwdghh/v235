title: 'PointMC: Multi-instance Point Cloud Registration based on Maximal Cliques'
openreview: 0JV5WpLQgv
abstract: Multi-instance point cloud registration is the problem of estimating multiple
  rigid transformations between two point clouds. Existing solutions rely on global
  spatial consistency of ambiguity and the time-consuming clustering of highdimensional
  correspondence features, making it difficult to handle registration scenarios where
  multiple instances overlap. To address these problems, we propose a maximal clique
  based multiinstance point cloud registration framework called PointMC. The key idea
  is to search for maximal cliques on the correspondence compatibility graph to estimate
  multiple transformations, and cluster these transformations into clusters corresponding
  to different instances to efficiently and accurately estimate all poses. PointMC
  leverages a correspondence embedding module that relies on local spatial consistency
  to effectively eliminate outliers, and the extracted discriminative features empower
  the network to circumvent missed pose detection in scenarios involving multiple
  overlapping instances. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and
  real-world datasets, and the results show that the proposed PointMC yields remarkable
  performance improvements.
