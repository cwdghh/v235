title: 'Re-Dock: Towards Flexible and Realistic Molecular Docking with Diffusion Bridge'
openreview: QRjTDhCIO8
abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding structures, a task known as
  molecular docking is crucial for drug design but remains challenging. While deep
  learning has shown promise, existing methods often depend on holo-protein structures
  (docked, and not accessible in realistic tasks) or neglect pocket sidechain conformations,
  leading to limited practical utility and unrealistic conformation predictions. To
  fill these gaps, we introduce an under-explored task, named flexible docking to
  predict poses of ligand and pocket sidechains simultaneously and introduce Re-Dock,
  a novel diffusion bridge generative model extended to geometric manifolds. Specifically,
  we propose energy-to-geometry mapping inspired by the Newton-Euler equation to co-model
  the binding energy and conformations for reflecting the energy-constrained docking
  generative process. Comprehensive experiments on designed benchmark datasets including
  apo-dock and cross-dock demonstrate our modelâ€™s superior effectiveness and efficiency
  over current methods.
