title: Joint Composite Latent Space Bayesian Optimization
openreview: wkCUmO7oi2
abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a technique for sample-efficient black-box
  optimization that employs probabilistic models to identify promising input for evaluation.
  When dealing with composite-structured functions, such as $f=g \circ h$, evaluating
  a specific location $x$ yields observations of both the final outcome $f(x) = g(h(x))$
  as well as the intermediate output(s) $h(x)$. Previous research has shown that integrating
  information from these intermediate outputs can enhance BO performance substantially.
  However, existing methods struggle if the outputs $h(x)$ are high-dimensional. Many
  relevant problems fall into this setting, including in the context of generative
  AI, molecular design, or robotics. To effectively tackle these challenges, we introduce
  Joint Composite Latent Space Bayesian Optimization (JoCo), a novel framework that
  jointly trains neural network encoders and probabilistic models to adaptively compress
  high-dimensional input and output spaces into manageable latent representations.
  This enables effective BO on these compressed representations, allowing JoCo to
  outperform other state-of-the-art methods in high-dimensional BO on a wide variety
  of simulated and real-world problems.
