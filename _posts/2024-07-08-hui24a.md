title: 'Make-A-Shape: a Ten-Million-scale 3D Shape Model'
openreview: 8l1KYguM4w
abstract: The progression in large-scale 3D generative models has been impeded by
  significant resource requirements for training and challenges like inefficient representations.
  This paper introduces Make-A-Shape, a novel 3D generative model trained on a vast
  scale, using 10 million publicly-available shapes. We first innovate the wavelet-tree
  representation to encode high-resolution SDF shapes with minimal loss, leveraging
  our newly-proposed subband coefficient filtering scheme. We then design a subband
  coefficient packing scheme to facilitate diffusion-based generation and a subband
  adaptive training strategy for effective training on the large-scale dataset. Our
  generative framework is versatile, capable of conditioning on various input modalities
  such as images, point clouds, and voxels, enabling a variety of downstream applications,
  e.g., unconditional generation, completion, and conditional generation. Our approach
  clearly surpasses the existing baselines in delivering high-quality results and
  can efficiently generate shapes within two seconds for most conditions.
