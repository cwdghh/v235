title: Feature Importance Disparities for Data Bias Investigations
openreview: fywWm06IGn
abstract: 'It is widely held that one cause of downstream bias in classifiers is bias
  present in the training data. Rectifying such biases may involve context-dependent
  interventions such as training separate models on subgroups, removing features with
  bias in the collection process, or even conducting real-world experiments to ascertain
  sources of bias. Despite the need for such data bias investigations, few automated
  methods exist to assist practitioners in these efforts. In this paper, we present
  one such method that given a dataset $X$ consisting of protected and unprotected
  features, outcomes $y$, and a regressor $h$ that predicts $y$ given $X$, outputs
  a tuple $(f_j, g)$, with the following property: $g$ corresponds to a subset of
  the training dataset $(X, y)$, such that the $j^{th}$ feature $f_j$ has much larger
  (or smaller) <em>influence</em> in the subgroup $g$, than on the dataset overall,
  which we call <em>feature importance disparity</em> (FID). We show across $4$ datasets
  and $4$ common feature importance methods of broad interest to the machine learning
  community that we can efficiently find subgroups with large FID values even over
  exponentially large subgroup classes and in practice these groups correspond to
  subgroups with potentially serious bias issues as measured by standard fairness
  metrics.'
