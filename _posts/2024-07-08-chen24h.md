title: 'MLLM-as-a-Judge: Assessing Multimodal LLM-as-a-Judge with Vision-Language
  Benchmark'
openreview: dbFEFHAD79
abstract: 'Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention
  recently, showing remarkable potential in artificial general intelligence. However,
  assessing the utility of MLLMs presents considerable challenges, primarily due to
  the absence multimodal benchmarks that align with human preferences. Drawing inspiration
  from the concept of LLM-as-a-Judge within LLMs, this paper introduces a novel benchmark,
  termed MLLM-as-a-Judge, to assess the ability of MLLMs in assisting judges across
  diverse modalities, encompassing three distinct tasks: Scoring Evaluation, Pair
  Comparison, and Batch Ranking. Our study reveals that, while MLLMs demonstrate remarkable
  human-like discernment in Pair Comparisons, there is a significant divergence from
  human preferences in Scoring Evaluation and Batch Ranking tasks. Furthermore, a
  closer examination reveals persistent challenges in the evaluative capacities of
  LLMs, including diverse biases, hallucinatory responses, and inconsistencies in
  judgment, even in advanced models such as GPT-4V. These findings emphasize the pressing
  need for enhancements and further research efforts to be undertaken before regarding
  MLLMs as fully reliable evaluators. In light of this, we advocate for additional
  efforts dedicated to supporting the continuous development within the domain of
  MLLM functioning as judges. The code and dataset are publicly available at our project
