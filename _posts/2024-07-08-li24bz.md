title: Towards efficient deep spiking neural networks construction with spiking activity
  based pruning
openreview: eMQyb1tvvc
abstract: The emergence of deep and large-scale spiking neural networks (SNNs) exhibiting
  high performance across diverse complex datasets has led to a need for compressing
  network models due to the presence of a significant number of redundant structural
  units, aiming to more effectively leverage their low-power consumption and biological
  interpretability advantages. Currently, most model compression techniques for SNNs
  are based on unstructured pruning of individual connections, which requires specific
  hardware support. Hence, we propose a structured pruning approach based on the activity
  levels of convolutional kernels named Spiking Channel Activity-based (SCA) network
  pruning framework. Inspired by synaptic plasticity mechanisms, our method dynamically
  adjusts the network’s structure by pruning and regenerating convolutional kernels
  during training, enhancing the model’s adaptation to the current target task. While
  maintaining model performance, this approach refines the network architecture, ultimately
  reducing computational load and accelerating the inference process. This indicates
  that structured dynamic sparse learning methods can better facilitate the application
  of deep SNNs in low-power and high-efficiency scenarios.
