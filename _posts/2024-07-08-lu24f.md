title: Open-Domain Text Evaluation via Contrastive Distribution Methods
openreview: 9HdQr68Zyl
abstract: 'Recent advancements in open-domain text generation, driven by the power
  of large pre-trained language models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable performance.
  However, assessing these models’ generation quality remains a challenge. In this
  paper, we introduce a novel method for evaluating open-domain text generation called
  Contrastive Distribution Methods (CDM). Leveraging the connection between increasing
  model parameters and enhanced LLM performance, CDM creates a mapping from the <em>contrast</em>
  of two probabilistic distributions – one known to be superior to the other – to
  quality measures. We investigate CDM for open-domain text generation evaluation
  under two paradigms: 1) <em>Generative</em> CDM, which harnesses the contrast of
  two language models’ distributions to generate synthetic examples for training discriminator-based
  metrics; 2) <em>Discriminative</em> CDM, which directly uses distribution disparities
  between two language models for evaluation. Our experiments on coherence evaluation
  for multi-turn dialogue and commonsense evaluation for controllable generation demonstrate
  CDM’s superior correlate with human judgment than existing automatic evaluation
  metrics, highlighting the strong performance and generalizability of our approach.'
