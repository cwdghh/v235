title: 'EDISON: Enhanced Dictionary-Induced Tensorized Incomplete Multi-View Clustering
  with Gaussian Error Rank Minimization'
openreview: fiugPLSXjK
abstract: This paper presents an efficient and scalable incomplete multi-view clustering
  method, referred to as Enhanced Dictionary-Induced tenSorized incomplete multi-view
  clustering with Gaussian errOr raNk minimization (EDISON). Specifically, EDISON
  employs an enhanced dictionary representation strategy as the foundation for inferring
  missing data and constructing anchor graphs, ensuring robustness to less-than-ideal
  data and maintaining high computational efficiency. Additionally, we introduce Gaussian
  error rank as a concise approximation of the true tensor rank, facilitating a comprehensive
  exploration of the diverse information encapsulated by various singular values in
  tensor data. Additionally, we integrate a hyper-anchor graph Laplacian manifold
  regularization into the tensor representation, allowing for the simultaneous utilization
  of inter-view high-order correlations and intra-view local correlations. Extensive
  experiments demonstrate the superiority of the EDISON model in both effectiveness
  and efficiency compared to SOTA methods.
