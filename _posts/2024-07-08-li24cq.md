title: Relaxing the Accurate Imputation Assumption in Doubly Robust Learning for Debiased
  Collaborative Filtering
openreview: Ln3moCobjO
abstract: Recommender system aims to recommend items or information that may interest
  users based on their behaviors and preferences. However, there may be sampling selection
  bias in the data collection process, i.e., the collected data is not a representative
  of the target population. Many debiasing methods are developed based on pseudo-labelings.
  Nevertheless, the validity of these methods relies heavily on accurate pseudo-labelings
  (i.e., the imputed labels), which is difficult to satisfy in practice. In this paper,
  we theoretically propose several novel doubly robust estimators that are unbiased
  when either (a) the pseudo-labelings deviate from the true labels with an arbitrary
  user-specific inductive bias, item-specific inductive bias, or a combination of
  both, or (b) the learned propensities are accurate. We further propose a propensity
  reconstruction learning approach that adaptively updates the constraint weights
  using an attention mechanism and effectively controls the variance. Extensive experiments
  show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on one semi-synthetic and
  three real-world datasets.
