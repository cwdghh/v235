title: 'Referee Can Play: An Alternative Approach to Conditional Generation via Model
  Inversion'
openreview: hZ0fWhgVch
abstract: As a dominant force in text-to-image generation tasks, Diffusion Probabilistic
  Models (DPMs) face a critical challenge in controllability, struggling to adhere
  strictly to complex, multi-faceted instructions. In this work, we aim to address
  this alignment challenge for conditional generation tasks. First, we provide an
  alternative view of state-of-the-art DPMs as a way of inverting advanced Vision-Language
  Models (VLMs). With this formulation, we naturally propose a training-free approach
  that bypasses the conventional sampling process associated with DPMs. By directly
  optimizing images with the supervision of discriminative VLMs, the proposed method
  can potentially achieve a better text-image alignment. As proof of concept, we demonstrate
  the pipeline with the pre-trained BLIP-2 model and identify several key designs
  for improved image generation. To further enhance the image fidelity, a Score Distillation
  Sampling module of Stable Diffusion is incorporated. By carefully balancing the
  two components during optimization, our method can produce high-quality images with
  near state-of-the-art performance on T2I-Compbench. The code is available at https://github.com/Pepper-lll/VLMinv.
