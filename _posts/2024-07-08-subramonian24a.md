title: 'Networked Inequality: Preferential Attachment Bias in Graph Neural Network
  Link Prediction'
openreview: GhPFmTJNfj
abstract: Graph neural network (GNN) link prediction is increasingly deployed in citation,
  collaboration, and online social networks to recommend academic literature, collaborators,
  and friends. While prior research has investigated the dyadic fairness of GNN link
  prediction, the within-group (e.g., queer women) fairness and "rich get richer"
  dynamics of link prediction remain underexplored. However, these aspects have significant
  consequences for degree and power imbalances in networks. In this paper, we shed
  light on how degree bias in networks affects Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) link
  prediction. In particular, we theoretically uncover that GCNs with a symmetric normalized
  graph filter have a within-group preferential attachment bias. We validate our theoretical
  analysis on real-world citation, collaboration, and online social networks. We further
  bridge GCNâ€™s preferential attachment bias with unfairness in link prediction and
  propose a new within-group fairness metric. This metric quantifies disparities in
  link prediction scores within social groups, towards combating the amplification
  of degree and power disparities. Finally, we propose a simple training-time strategy
  to alleviate within-group unfairness, and we show that it is effective on citation,
  social, and credit networks.
