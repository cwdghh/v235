title: 'Position: Towards Implicit Prompt For Text-To-Image Models'
openreview: H9fNj8ivTy
abstract: 'Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have had great success, and many benchmarks
  have been proposed to evaluate their performance and safety. However, they only
  consider explicit prompts while neglecting implicit prompts (hint at a target without
  explicitly mentioning it). These prompts may get rid of safety constraints and pose
  potential threats to the applications of these models. This position paper highlights
  the current state of T2I models toward implicit prompts. We present a benchmark
  named ImplicitBench and conduct an investigation on the performance and impacts
  of implicit prompts with popular T2I models. Specifically, we design and collect
  more than 2,000 implicit prompts of three aspects: General Symbols, Celebrity Privacy,
  and Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) Issues, and evaluate six well-known T2I modelsâ€™ capabilities
  under these implicit prompts. Experiment results show that (1) T2I models are able
  to accurately create various target symbols indicated by implicit prompts; (2) Implicit
  prompts bring potential risks of privacy leakage for T2I models. (3) Constraints
  of NSFW in most of the evaluated T2I models can be bypassed with implicit prompts.
  We call for increased attention to the potential and risks of implicit prompts in
  the T2I community and further investigation into the capabilities and impacts of
  implicit prompts, advocating for a balanced approach that harnesses their benefits
  while mitigating their risks.'
