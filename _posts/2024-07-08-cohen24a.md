title: 'Slicedit: Zero-Shot Video Editing With Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Using
  Spatio-Temporal Slices'
openreview: kUm9iuvwIQ
abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art results in
  image synthesis and editing. However, leveraging such pre-trained models for video
  editing is considered a major challenge. Many existing works attempt to enforce
  temporal consistency in the edited video through explicit correspondence mechanisms,
  either in pixel space or between deep features. These methods, however, struggle
  with strong nonrigid motion. In this paper, we introduce a fundamentally different
  approach, which is based on the observation that spatiotemporal slices of natural
  videos exhibit similar characteristics to natural images. Thus, the same T2I diffusion
  model that is normally used only as a prior on video frames, can also serve as a
  strong prior for enhancing temporal consistency by applying it on spatiotemporal
  slices. Based on this observation, we present Slicedit, a method for text-based
  video editing that utilizes a pre-trained T2I diffusion model to process both spatial
  and spatiotemporal slices. Our method generates videos that retain the structure
  and motion of the original video while adhering to the target text. Through extensive
  experiments, we demonstrate Sliceditâ€™s ability to edit a wide range of real-world
  videos, confirming its clear advantages compared to existing baselines.
