title: Bootstrap AutoEncoders With Contrastive Paradigm for Self-supervised Gaze Estimation
openreview: ykRY34kL3j
abstract: Existing self-supervised methods for gaze estimation using the dominant
  streams of contrastive and generative approaches are restricted to eye images and
  could fail in general full-face settings. In this paper, we reveal that contrastive
  methods are ineffective in data augmentation for self-supervised full-face gaze
  estimation, while generative methods are prone to trivial solutions due to the absence
  of explicit regularization on semantic representations. To address this challenge,
  we propose a novel approach called <b>B</b>ootstrap auto-<b>e</b>ncoders with <b>C</b>ontrastive
  p<b>a</b>radigm (<b>BeCa</b>), which combines the strengths of both generative and
  contrastive methods. Specifically, we revisit the Auto-Encoder used in generative
  approaches and incorporate the contrastive paradigm to introduce explicit regularization
  on gaze representation. Furthermore, we design the InfoMSE loss as an alternative
  to the vanilla MSE loss for Auto-Encoder to mitigate the inconsistency between reconstruction
  and representation learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
  approaches outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised gaze approaches on extensive
  datasets (including wild scenes) under both within-dataset and cross-dataset protocols.
