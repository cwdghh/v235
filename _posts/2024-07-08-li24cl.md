title: Towards Optimal Adversarial Robust Q-learning with Bellman Infinity-error
openreview: pgI9inG2Ny
abstract: 'Establishing robust policies is essential to counter attacks or disturbances
  affecting deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents. Recent studies explore state-adversarial
  robustness and suggest the potential lack of an optimal robust policy (ORP), posing
  challenges in setting strict robustness constraints. This work further investigates
  ORP: At first, we introduce a consistency assumption of policy (CAP) stating that
  optimal actions in the Markov decision process remain consistent with minor perturbations,
  supported by empirical and theoretical evidence. Building upon CAP, we crucially
  prove the existence of a deterministic and stationary ORP that aligns with the Bellman
  optimal policy. Furthermore, we illustrate the necessity of $L^{\infty}$-norm when
  minimizing Bellman error to attain ORP. This finding clarifies the vulnerability
  of prior DRL algorithms that target the Bellman optimal policy with $L^{1}$-norm
  and motivates us to train a Consistent Adversarial Robust Deep Q-Network (CAR-DQN)
  by minimizing a surrogate of Bellman Infinity-error. The top-tier performance of
  CAR-DQN across various benchmarks validates its practical effectiveness and reinforces
  the soundness of our theoretical analysis.'
