title: 'SLOG: An Inductive Spectral Graph Neural Network Beyond Polynomial Filter'
openreview: 0SrNCSklZx
abstract: 'Graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited superb power in many graph
  related tasks. Existing GNNs can be categorized into spatial GNNs and spectral GNNs.
  The spatial GNNs primarily capture the local information around each node, while
  the spectral GNNs are able to operate on the frequency signals of the entire graph.
  However, most, if not all, existing spectral GNNs are faced with two limitations:
  (1) the polynomial limitation that for most spectral GNNs, the expressive power
  in the spectral domain is limited to polynomial filters; and (2) the transductive
  limitation that most spectral GNNs can only be applied to the transductive setting
  on relatively small-scale graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel spectral graph
  neural network named SLOG to solve the above two limitations. For the polynomial
  limitation, SLOG proposes a novel real-valued filter with geometric interpretability,
  mathematical feasibility and adaptive filtering ability to go beyond polynomial.
  For the transductive limitation, SLOG combines the subgraph sampling technique in
  spatial GNNs and the signal processing technique in spectral GNNs together to make
  itself tailored to the inductive setting on large-scale graphs. Extensive experimental
  results on 16 datasets demonstrate the superiority of SLOG in inductive homophilic
  and heterophilic node classification task.'
