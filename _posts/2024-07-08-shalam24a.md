title: The Balanced-Pairwise-Affinities Feature Transform
openreview: pspyQm4ko0
abstract: The Balanced-Pairwise-Affinities (BPA) feature transform is designed to
  upgrade the features of a set of input items to facilitate downstream matching or
  grouping related tasks. The transformed set encodes a rich representation of high
  order relations between the input features. A particular min-cost-max-flow fractional
  matching problem, whose entropy regularized version can be approximated by an optimal
  transport (OT) optimization, leads to a transform which is efficient, differentiable,
  equivariant, parameterless and probabilistically interpretable. While the Sinkhorn
  OT solver has been adapted extensively in many contexts, we use it differently by
  minimizing the cost between a set of features to <em>itself</em> and using the transport
  planâ€™s <em>rows</em> as the new representation.Empirically, the transform is highly
  effective and flexible in its use and consistently improves networks it is inserted
  into, in a variety of tasks and training schemes. We demonstrate state-of-the-art
  results in few-shot classification, unsupervised image clustering and person re-identification.
