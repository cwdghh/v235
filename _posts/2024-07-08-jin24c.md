title: On the Maximal Local Disparity of Fairness-Aware Classifiers
openreview: 5cm2jGct2W
abstract: 'Fairness has become a crucial aspect in the development of trustworthy
  machine learning algorithms. Current fairness metrics to measure the violation of
  demographic parity have the following drawbacks: (i) the <em>average difference</em>
  of model predictions on two groups cannot reflect their <em>distribution disparity</em>,
  and (ii) the <em>overall</em> calculation along all possible predictions conceals
  the <em>extreme local disparity</em> at or around certain predictions. In this work,
  we propose a novel fairness metric called <b>M</b>aximal <b>C</b>umulative ratio
  <b>D</b>isparity along varying <b>P</b>redictionsâ€™ neighborhood (MCDP), for measuring
  the maximal local disparity of the fairness-aware classifiers. To accurately and
  efficiently calculate the MCDP, we develop a provably exact and an approximate calculation
  algorithm that greatly reduces the computational complexity with low estimation
  error. We further propose a bi-level optimization algorithm using a differentiable
  approximation of the MCDP for improving the algorithmic fairness. Extensive experiments
  on both tabular and image datasets validate that our fair training algorithm can
  achieve superior fairness-accuracy trade-offs.'
