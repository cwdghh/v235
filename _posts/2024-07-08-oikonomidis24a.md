title: Adaptive Proximal Gradient Methods Are Universal Without Approximation
openreview: SUxarNgrUT
abstract: We show that adaptive proximal gradient methods for convex problems are
  not restricted to traditional Lipschitzian assumptions. Our analysis reveals that
  a class of linesearch-free methods is still convergent under mere local Hölder gradient
  continuity, covering in particular continuously differentiable semi-algebraic functions.
  To mitigate the lack of local Lipschitz continuity, popular approaches revolve around
  $\varepsilon$-oracles and/or linesearch procedures. In contrast, we exploit plain
  Hölder inequalities not entailing any approximation, all while retaining the linesearch-free
  nature of adaptive schemes. Furthermore, we prove full sequence convergence without
  prior knowledge of local Hölder constants nor of the order of Hölder continuity.
  Numerical experiments make comparisons with baseline methods on diverse tasks from
  machine learning covering both the locally and the globally Hölder setting.
