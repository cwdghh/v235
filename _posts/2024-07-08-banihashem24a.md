title: A Dynamic Algorithm for Weighted Submodular Cover Problem
openreview: uUeXaKLE1I
abstract: 'We initiate the study of the submodular cover problem in a dynamic setting
  where the elements of the ground set are inserted and deleted. In the classical
  submodular cover problem, we are given a monotone submodular function $f : 2^{V}
  \to \mathbb{R}^{\ge 0}$ and the goal is to obtain a set $S \subseteq V$ that minimizes
  the cost subject to the constraint $f(S) = f(V)$. This is a classical problem in
  computer science and generalizes the Set Cover problem, 2-Set Cover, and dominating
  set problem among others. We consider this problem in a dynamic setting where there
  are updates to our set $V$, in the form of insertions and deletions of elements
  from a ground set $\mathcal{V}$, and the goal is to maintain an approximately optimal
  solution with low query complexity per update. For this problem, we propose a randomized
  algorithm that, in expectation, obtains a $(1-O(\epsilon), O(\epsilon^{-1}))$-bicriteria
  approximation using polylogarithmic query complexity per update.'
