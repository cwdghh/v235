title: Graph Structure Extrapolation for Out-of-Distribution Generalization
openreview: Xgrey8uQhr
abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization deals with the prevalent learning
  scenario where test distribution shifts from training distribution. With rising
  application demands and inherent complexity, graph OOD problems call for specialized
  solutions. While data-centric methods exhibit performance enhancements on many generic
  machine learning tasks, there is a notable absence of data augmentation methods
  tailored for graph OOD generalization. In this work, we propose to achieve graph
  OOD generalization with the novel design of non-Euclidean-space linear extrapolation.
  The proposed augmentation strategy extrapolates structure spaces to generate OOD
  graph data. Our design tailors OOD samples for specific shifts without corrupting
  underlying causal mechanisms. Theoretical analysis and empirical results evidence
  the effectiveness of our method in solving target shifts, showing substantial and
  constant improvements across various graph OOD tasks.
