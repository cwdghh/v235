title: Exact Soft Analytical Side-Channel Attacks using Tractable Circuits
openreview: 0mklK4h0rX
abstract: Detecting weaknesses in cryptographic algorithms is of utmost importance
  for designing secure information systems. The state-of-the-art <em>soft analytical
  side-channel attack</em> (SASCA) uses physical leakage information to make probabilistic
  predictions about intermediate computations and combines these "guesses" with the
  known algorithmic logic to compute the posterior distribution over the key. This
  attack is commonly performed via loopy belief propagation, which, however, lacks
  guarantees in terms of convergence and inference quality. In this paper, we develop
  a fast and exact inference method for SASCA, denoted as ExSASCA, by leveraging knowledge
  compilation and tractable probabilistic circuits. When attacking the <em>Advanced
  Encryption Standard</em> (AES), the most widely used encryption algorithm to date,
  ExSASCA outperforms SASCA by more than 31% top-1 success rate absolute. By leveraging
  sparse belief messages, this performance is achieved with little more computational
  cost than SASCA, and about 3 orders of magnitude less than exact inference via exhaustive
  enumeration. Even with dense belief messages, ExSASCA still uses 6 times less computations
  than exhaustive inference.
