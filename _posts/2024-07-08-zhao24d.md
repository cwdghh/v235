title: Image Fusion via Vision-Language Model
openreview: eqY64Z1rsT
abstract: 'Image fusion integrates essential information from multiple images into
  a single composite, enhancing structures, textures, and refining imperfections.
  Existing methods predominantly focus on pixel-level and semantic visual features
  for recognition, but often overlook the deeper text-level semantic information beyond
  vision. Therefore, we introduce a novel fusion paradigm named image Fusion via vIsion-Language
  Model (FILM), for the first time, utilizing explicit textual information from source
  images to guide the fusion process. Specifically, FILM generates semantic prompts
  from images and inputs them into ChatGPT for comprehensive textual descriptions.
  These descriptions are fused within the textual domain and guide the visual information
  fusion, enhancing feature extraction and contextual understanding, directed by textual
  semantic information via cross-attention. FILM has shown promising results in four
  image fusion tasks: infrared-visible, medical, multi-exposure, and multi-focus image
  fusion. We also propose a vision-language dataset containing ChatGPT-generated paragraph
  descriptions for the eight image fusion datasets across four fusion tasks, facilitating
  future research in vision-language model-based image fusion. Code and dataset are
  available at https://github.com/Zhaozixiang1228/IF-FILM.'
