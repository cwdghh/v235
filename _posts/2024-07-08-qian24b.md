title: 'ByMI: Byzantine Machine Identification with False Discovery Rate Control'
openreview: G0z4bCNmkG
abstract: Various robust estimation methods or algorithms have been proposed to hedge
  against Byzantine failures in distributed learning. However, there is a lack of
  systematic approaches to provide theoretical guarantees of significance in detecting
  those Byzantine machines. In this paper, we develop a general detection procedure,
  ByMI, via error rate control to address this issue, which is applicable to many
  robust learning problems. The key idea is to apply the sample-splitting strategy
  on each worker machine to construct a score statistic integrated with a general
  robust estimation and then to utilize the symmetry property of those scores to derive
  a data-driven threshold. The proposed method is dimension insensitive and p-value
  free with the help of the symmetry property and can achieve false discovery rate
  control under mild conditions. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real
  data validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
  method on Byzantine machine identification.
