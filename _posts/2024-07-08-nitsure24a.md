title: Risk Aware Benchmarking of Large Language Models
openreview: Mv8y13wfDm
abstract: We propose a distributional framework for benchmarking socio-technical risks
  of foundation models with quantified statistical significance. Our approach hinges
  on a new statistical relative testing based on first and second order stochastic
  dominance of real random variables. We show that the second order statistics in
  this test are linked to mean-risk models commonly used in econometrics and mathematical
  finance to balance risk and utility when choosing between alternatives. Using this
  framework, we formally develop a risk-aware approach for foundation model selection
  given guardrails quantified by specified metrics. Inspired by portfolio optimization
  and selection theory in mathematical finance, we define a metrics portfolio for
  each model as a means to aggregate a collection of metrics, and perform model selection
  based on the stochastic dominance of these portfolios. The statistical significance
  of our tests is backed theoretically by an asymptotic analysis via central limit
  theorems instantiated in practice via a bootstrap variance estimate. We use our
  framework to compare various large language models regarding risks related to drifting
  from instructions and outputting toxic content.
