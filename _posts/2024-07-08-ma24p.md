title: High-dimensional Linear Bandits with Knapsacks
openreview: 4lghifYrSU
abstract: We study the contextual bandits with knapsack (CBwK) problem under the high-dimensional
  setting where the dimension of the feature is large. We investigate how to exploit
  the sparsity structure to achieve improved regret for the CBwK problem. To this
  end, we first develop an online variant of the hard thresholding algorithm that
  performs the optimal sparse estimation. We further combine our online estimator
  with a primal-dual framework, where we assign a dual variable to each knapsack constraint
  and utilize an online learning algorithm to update the dual variable, thereby controlling
  the consumption of the knapsack capacity. We show that this integrated approach
  allows us to achieve a sublinear regret that depends logarithmically on the feature
  dimension, thus improving the polynomial dependency established in the previous
  literature. We also apply our framework to the high-dimension contextual bandit
  problem without the knapsack constraint and achieve optimal regret in both the data-poor
  regime and the data-rich regime.
