title: Diffusive Gibbs Sampling
openreview: QH4mXDEULp
abstract: The inadequate mixing of conventional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods
  for multi-modal distributions presents a significant challenge in practical applications
  such as Bayesian inference and molecular dynamics. Addressing this, we propose Diffusive
  Gibbs Sampling (DiGS), an innovative family of sampling methods designed for effective
  sampling from distributions characterized by distant and disconnected modes. DiGS
  integrates recent developments in diffusion models, leveraging Gaussian convolution
  to create an auxiliary noisy distribution that bridges isolated modes in the original
  space and applying Gibbs sampling to alternately draw samples from both spaces.
  A novel Metropolis-within-Gibbs scheme is proposed to enhance mixing in the denoising
  sampling step. DiGS exhibits a better mixing property for sampling multi-modal distributions
  than state-of-the-art methods such as parallel tempering, attaining substantially
  improved performance across various tasks, including mixtures of Gaussians, Bayesian
  neural networks and molecular dynamics.
