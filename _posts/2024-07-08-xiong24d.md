title: A General Framework for Sequential Decision-Making under Adaptivity Constraints
openreview: IYI61L7SPk
abstract: 'We take the first step in studying general sequential decision-making under
  two adaptivity constraints: rare policy switch and batch learning. First, we provide
  a general class called the Eluder Condition class, which includes a wide range of
  reinforcement learning classes. Then, for the rare policy switch constraint, we
  provide a generic algorithm to achieve a $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\log K) $ switching
  cost with a $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{K})$ regret on the EC class. For the
  batch learning constraint, we provide an algorithm that provides a $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{K}+K/B)$
  regret with the number of batches $B.$ This paper is the first work considering
  rare policy switch and batch learning under general function classes, which covers
  nearly all the models studied in the previous works such as tabular MDP (Bai et
  al. 2019, Zhang et al. 2020), linear MDP (Wang et al. 2021, Gao et al. 2021), low
  eluder dimension MDP (Kong et al., 2021; Velegkas et al., 2022), generalized linear
  function approximation (Qiao et al. 2023), and also some new classes such as the
  low $D_\Delta$-type Bellman eluder dimension problem, linear mixture MDP, kernelized
  nonlinear regulator and undercomplete partially observed Markov decision process
  (POMDP).'
