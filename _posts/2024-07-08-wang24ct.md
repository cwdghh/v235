title: Diffusion Language Models Are Versatile Protein Learners
openreview: NUAbSFqyqb
abstract: 'This paper introduces diffusion protein language model (DPLM), a versatile
  protein language model that demonstrates strong generative and predictive capabilities
  for protein sequences. We first pre-train scalable DPLMs from evolutionary-scale
  protein sequences within a generative self-supervised discrete diffusion probabilistic
  framework, which generalizes language modeling for proteins in a principled way.
  After pre-training, DPLM exhibits the ability to generate structurally plausible,
  novel and diverse protein sequences for unconditional generation. We further demonstrate
  the proposed diffusion generative pre-training make DPLM possess a better understanding
  of proteins, making it a superior representation learner, which can be fine-tuned
  for various predictive tasks, comparing favorably to ESM2. Moreover, DPLM can be
  tailored for various needs, which showcases its prowess of conditional generation
  in several ways: (1) conditioning on partial peptide sequences, e.g., generating
  scaffolds for functional motifs with high success rate; (2) incorporating other
  modalities as conditioners, e.g., structure-conditioned generation for inverse folding;
  and (3) steering sequence generation towards desired properties, e.g., satisfying
  specified secondary structures, through a plug-and-play classifier guidance.'
