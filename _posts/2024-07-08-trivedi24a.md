title: Editing Partially Observable Networks via Graph Diffusion Models
openreview: 2cEhQ4vtTf
abstract: 'Most real-world networks are noisy and incomplete samples from an unknown
  target distribution. Refining them by correcting corruptions or inferring unobserved
  regions typically improves downstream performance. Inspired by the impressive generative
  capabilities that have been used to correct corruptions in images, and the similarities
  between "in-painting" and filling in missing nodes and edges conditioned on the
  observed graph, we propose a novel graph generative framework, SGDM, which is based
  on subgraph diffusion. Our framework not only improves the scalability and fidelity
  of graph diffusion models, but also leverages the reverse process to perform novel,
  conditional generation tasks. In particular, through extensive empirical analysis
  and a set of novel metrics, we demonstrate that our proposed model effectively supports
  the following refinement tasks for partially observable networks: (T1) denoising
  extraneous subgraphs, (T2) expanding existing subgraphs and (T3) performing â€œstyle"
  transfer by regenerating a particular subgraph to match the characteristics of a
  different node or subgraph.'
