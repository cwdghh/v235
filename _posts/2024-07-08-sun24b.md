title: 'Breaking the Barrier: Enhanced Utility and Robustness in Smoothed DRL Agents'
openreview: WJ5fJhwvCl
abstract: 'Robustness remains a paramount concern in deep reinforcement learning (DRL),
  with randomized smoothing emerging as a key technique for enhancing this attribute.
  However, a notable gap exists in the performance of current smoothed DRL agents,
  often characterized by significantly low clean rewards and weak robustness. In response
  to this challenge, our study introduces innovative algorithms aimed at training
  effective smoothed robust DRL agents. We propose S-DQN and S-PPO, novel approaches
  that demonstrate remarkable improvements in clean rewards, empirical robustness,
  and robustness guarantee across standard RL benchmarks. Notably, our S-DQN and S-PPO
  agents not only significantly outperform existing smoothed agents by an average
  factor of $2.16\times$ under the strongest attack, but also surpass previous robustly-trained
  agents by an average factor of $2.13\times$. This represents a significant leap
  forward in the field. Furthermore, we introduce Smoothed Attack, which is $1.89\times$
  more effective in decreasing the rewards of smoothed agents than existing adversarial
  attacks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Trustworthy-ML-Lab/Robust_HighUtil_Smoothed_DRL'
