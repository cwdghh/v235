title: 'Surface-VQMAE: Vector-quantized Masked Auto-encoders on Molecular Surfaces'
openreview: szxtVHOh0C
abstract: Molecular surfaces imply fingerprints of interaction patterns between proteins.
  However, non-equivalent efforts have been paid to incorporating the abundant protein
  surface information for analyzing proteins’ biological functions in juxtaposition
  to amino acid sequences and 3D structures. We propose a novel surface-based unsupervised
  learning algorithm termed Surface-VQMAE to overcome this obstacle. In light of surface
  point clouds’ sparsity and disorder properties, we first partition them into patches
  and obtain the sequential arrangement via the Morton curve. Successively, a Transformer-based
  architecture named SurfFormer was introduced to integrate the surface geometry and
  capture patch-level relations. At last, we enhance the prevalent masked auto-encoder
  (MAE) with the vector quantization (VQ) technique, which establishes a surface pattern
  codebook to enforce a discrete posterior distribution of latent variables and achieve
  more condensed semantics. Our work is the foremost to implement pretraining purely
  on molecular surfaces and extensive experiments on diverse real-life scenarios including
  binding site scoring, binding affinity prediction, and mutant effect estimation
  demonstrate its effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/smiles724/VQMAE.
