title: Total Variation Distance Meets Probabilistic Inference
openreview: 6OSLjErBhh
abstract: In this paper, we establish a novel connection between total variation (TV)
  distance estimation and probabilistic inference. In particular, we present an efficient,
  structure-preserving reduction from relative approximation of TV distance to probabilistic
  inference over directed graphical models. This reduction leads to a fully polynomial
  randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) for estimating TV distances between same-structure
  distributions over any class of Bayes nets for which there is an efficient probabilistic
  inference algorithm. In particular, it leads to an FPRAS for estimating TV distances
  between distributions that are defined over a common Bayes net of small treewidth.
  Prior to this work, such approximation schemes only existed for estimating TV distances
  between product distributions. Our approach employs a new notion of <em>partial</em>
  couplings of high-dimensional distributions, which might be of independent interest.
