title: On Which Nodes Does GCN Fail? Enhancing GCN From the Node Perspective
openreview: dcwUGaK9sQ
abstract: 'The label smoothness assumption is at the core of Graph Convolutional Networks
  (GCNs): nodes in a local region have similar labels. Thus, GCN performs local feature
  smoothing operation to adhere to this assumption. However, there exist some nodes
  whose labels obtained by feature smoothing conflict with the label smoothness assumption.
  We find that the label smoothness assumption and the process of feature smoothing
  are both problematic on these nodes, and call these nodes out of GCN’s control (OOC
  nodes). In this paper, first, we design the corresponding algorithm to locate the
  OOC nodes, then we summarize the characteristics of OOC nodes that affect their
  representation learning, and based on their characteristics, we present DaGCN, an
  efficient framework that can facilitate the OOC nodes. Extensive experiments verify
  the superiority of the proposed method and demonstrate that current advanced GCNs
  are improvements specifically on OOC nodes; the remaining nodes under GCN’s control
  (UC nodes) are already optimally represented by vanilla GCN on most datasets.'
