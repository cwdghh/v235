title: 'RL-CFR: Improving Action Abstraction for Imperfect Information Extensive-Form
  Games with Reinforcement Learning'
openreview: pA2Q5Wfspp
abstract: Effective action abstraction is crucial in tackling challenges associated
  with large action spaces in Imperfect Information Extensive-Form Games (IIEFGs).
  However, due to the vast state space and computational complexity in IIEFGs, existing
  methods often rely on fixed abstractions, resulting in sub-optimal performance.
  In response, we introduce RL-CFR, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach for
  dynamic action abstraction. RL-CFR builds upon our innovative Markov Decision Process
  (MDP) formulation, with states corresponding to public information and actions represented
  as feature vectors indicating specific action abstractions. The reward is defined
  as the expected payoff difference between the selected and default action abstractions.
  RL-CFR constructs a game tree with RL-guided action abstractions and utilizes counterfactual
  regret minimization (CFR) for strategy derivation. Impressively, it can be trained
  from scratch, achieving higher expected payoff without increased CFR solving time.
  In experiments on Heads-up No-limit Texas Hold’em, RL-CFR outperforms ReBeL’s replication
  and Slumbot, demonstrating significant win-rate margins of $64\pm 11$ and $84\pm
  17$ mbb/hand, respectively.
