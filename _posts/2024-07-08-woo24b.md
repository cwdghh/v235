title: 'Federated Offline Reinforcement Learning: Collaborative Single-Policy Coverage
  Suffices'
openreview: LIPGadocTe
abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL), which seeks to learn an optimal policy
  using offline data, has garnered significant interest due to its potential in critical
  applications where online data collection is infeasible or expensive. This work
  explores the benefit of federated learning for offline RL, aiming at collaboratively
  leveraging offline datasets at multiple agents. Focusing on finite-horizon episodic
  tabular Markov decision processes (MDPs), we design FedLCB-Q, a variant of the popular
  model-free Q-learning algorithm tailored for federated offline RL. FedLCB-Q updates
  local Q-functions at agents with novel learning rate schedules and aggregates them
  at a central server using importance averaging and a carefully designed pessimistic
  penalty term. Our sample complexity analysis reveals that, with appropriately chosen
  parameters and synchronization schedules, FedLCB-Q achieves linear speedup in terms
  of the number of agents without requiring high-quality datasets at individual agents,
  as long as the local datasets collectively cover the state-action space visited
  by the optimal policy, highlighting the power of collaboration in the federated
  setting. In fact, the sample complexity almost matches that of the single-agent
  counterpart, as if all the data are stored at a central location, up to polynomial
  factors of the horizon length. Furthermore, FedLCB-Q is communication-efficient,
  where the number of communication rounds is only linear with respect to the horizon
  length up to logarithmic factors.
