title: 'CaPS: Collaborative and Private Synthetic Data Generation from Distributed
  Sources'
openreview: ZXsNkm3bxu
abstract: Data is the lifeblood of the modern world, forming a fundamental part of
  AI, decision-making, and research advances. With increase in interest in data, governments
  have taken important steps towards a regulated data world, drastically impacting
  data sharing and data usability and resulting in massive amounts of data confined
  within the walls of organizations. While synthetic data generation (SDG) is an appealing
  solution to break down these walls and enable data sharing, the main drawback of
  existing solutions is the assumption of a trusted aggregator for generative model
  training. Given that many data holders may not want to, or be legally allowed to,
  entrust a central entity with their raw data, we propose a framework for collaborative
  and private generation of synthetic tabular data from distributed data holders.
  Our solution is general, applicable to any marginal-based SDG, and provides input
  privacy by replacing the trusted aggregator with secure multi-party computation
  (MPC) protocols and output privacy via differential privacy (DP). We demonstrate
  the applicability and scalability of our approach for the state-of-the-art select-measure-generate
  SDG algorithms MWEM+PGM and AIM.
