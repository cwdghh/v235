title: 'Compression of Structured Data with Autoencoders: Provable Benefit of Nonlinearities
  and Depth'
openreview: 1HDrfUahXv
abstract: 'Autoencoders are a prominent model in many empirical branches of machine
  learning and lossy data compression. However, basic theoretical questions remain
  unanswered even in a shallow two-layer setting. In particular, to what degree does
  a shallow autoencoder capture the structure of the underlying data distribution?
  For the prototypical case of the 1-bit compression of <em>sparse</em> Gaussian data,
  we prove that gradient descent converges to a solution that completely disregards
  the sparse structure of the input. Namely, the performance of the algorithm is the
  same as if it was compressing a Gaussian source – with no sparsity. For general
  data distributions, we give evidence of a phase transition phenomenon in the shape
  of the gradient descent minimizer, as a function of the data sparsity: below the
  critical sparsity level, the minimizer is a rotation taken uniformly at random (just
  like in the compression of non-sparse data); above the critical sparsity, the minimizer
  is the identity (up to a permutation). Finally, by exploiting a connection with
  approximate message passing algorithms, we show how to improve upon Gaussian performance
  for the compression of sparse data: adding a denoising function to a shallow architecture
  already reduces the loss provably, and a suitable multi-layer decoder leads to a
  further improvement. We validate our findings on image datasets, such as CIFAR-10
  and MNIST.'
