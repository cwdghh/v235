title: 'Beyond Point Prediction: Score Matching-based Pseudolikelihood Estimation
  of Neural Marked Spatio-Temporal Point Process'
openreview: CpI37NA7MO
abstract: 'Spatio-temporal point processes (STPPs) are potent mathematical tools for
  modeling and predicting events with both temporal and spatial features. Despite
  their versatility, most existing methods for learning STPPs either assume a restricted
  form of the spatio-temporal distribution, or suffer from inaccurate approximations
  of the intractable integral in the likelihood training objective. These issues typically
  arise from the normalization term of the probability density function. Moreover,
  existing works only provide point prediction for events without quantifying their
  uncertainty, such as confidence intervals for the event’s arrival time and confidence
  regions for the event’s location, which is crucial given the considerable randomness
  of the data. To tackle these challenges, we introduce SMASH: a Score MAtching-based
  pSeudolikeliHood estimator for learning marked STPPs. Specifically, our framework
  adopts a normalization-free objective by estimating the pseudolikelihood of marked
  STPPs through score-matching and predicts confidence intervals/regions for event
  time and location by generating samples through a score-based sampling algorithm.
  The superior performance of our proposed framework is demonstrated through extensive
  experiments on both point and confidence interval/region prediction of events.'
