title: 'Perturb-and-Project: Differentially Private Similarities and Marginals'
openreview: 45HNimd4YI
abstract: We revisit the objective perturbations framework for differential privacy
  where noise is added to the input $A\in \mathcal{S}$ and the result is then projected
  back to the space of admissible datasets $\mathcal{S}$. Through this framework,
  we first design novel efficient algorithms to privately release pair-wise cosine
  similarities. Second, we derive a novel algorithm to compute $k$-way marginal queries
  over $n$ features. Prior work could achieve comparable guarantees only for $k$ even.
  Furthermore, we extend our results to $t$-sparse datasets, where our efficient algorithms
  yields novel, stronger guarantees whenever $t\le n^{5/6}/\log n.$ Finally, we provide
  a theoretical perspective on why <em>fast</em> input perturbation algorithms works
  well in practice. The key technical ingredients behind our results are tight sum-of-squares
  certificates upper bounding the Gaussian complexity of sets of solutions.
