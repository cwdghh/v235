title: Self-Composing Policies for Scalable Continual Reinforcement Learning
openreview: f5gtX2VWSB
abstract: This work introduces a growable and modular neural network architecture
  that naturally avoids catastrophic forgetting and interference in continual reinforcement
  learning. The structure of each module allows the selective combination of previous
  policies along with its internal policy accelerating the learning process on the
  current task. Unlike previous growing neural network approaches, we show that the
  number of parameters of the proposed approach grows linearly with respect to the
  number of tasks, and does not sacrifice plasticity to scale. Experiments conducted
  in benchmark continuous control and visual problems reveal that the proposed approach
  achieves greater knowledge transfer and performance than alternative methods.
