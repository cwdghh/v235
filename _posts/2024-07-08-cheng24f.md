title: 'GaussianPro: 3D Gaussian Splatting with Progressive Propagation'
openreview: lQ3SEBH1gF
abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently revolutionized the field of neural
  rendering with its high fidelity and efficiency. However, 3DGS heavily depends on
  the initialized point cloud produced by Structure-from-Motion (SfM) techniques.
  When tackling large-scale scenes that unavoidably contain texture-less surfaces,
  SfM techniques fail to produce enough points in these surfaces and cannot provide
  good initialization for 3DGS. As a result, 3DGS suffers from difficult optimization
  and low-quality renderings. In this paper, inspired by classic multi-view stereo
  (MVS) techniques, we propose GaussianPro, a novel method that applies a progressive
  propagation strategy to guide the densification of the 3D Gaussians. Compared to
  the simple split and clone strategies used in 3DGS, our method leverages the priors
  of the existing reconstructed geometries of the scene and utilizes patch matching
  to produce new Gaussians with accurate positions and orientations. Experiments on
  both large-scale and small-scale scenes validate the effectiveness of our method.
  Our method significantly surpasses 3DGS on the Waymo dataset, exhibiting an improvement
  of 1.15dB in terms of PSNR. Codes and data are available at https://github.com/kcheng1021/GaussianPro.
