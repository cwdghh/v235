title: Bayesian Uncertainty for Gradient Aggregation in Multi-Task Learning
openreview: GiHo83ozsF
abstract: As machine learning becomes more prominent there is a growing demand to
  perform several inference tasks in parallel. Multi-task learning (MTL) addresses
  this challenge by learning a single model that solves several tasks simultaneously
  and efficiently. Often optimizing MTL models entails first computing the gradient
  of the loss for each task, and then aggregating all the gradients to obtain a combined
  update direction. However, common methods following this approach do not consider
  an important aspect, the sensitivity in the dimensions of the gradients. Some dimensions
  may be more lenient for changes while others may be more restrictive. Here, we introduce
  a novel gradient aggregation procedure using Bayesian inference. We place a probability
  distribution over the task-specific parameters, which in turn induce a <em>distribution</em>
  over the gradients of the tasks. This valuable information allows us to quantify
  the uncertainty associated with each of the gradientsâ€™ dimensions which is factored
  in when aggregating them. We empirically demonstrate the benefits of our approach
  in a variety of datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
