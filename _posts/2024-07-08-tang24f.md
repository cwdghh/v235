title: Accelerating Parallel Sampling of Diffusion Models
openreview: CjVWen8aJL
abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative models for
  image generation. However, sampling from diffusion models is usually time-consuming
  due to the inherent autoregressive nature of their sampling process. In this work,
  we propose a novel approach that accelerates the sampling of diffusion models by
  parallelizing the autoregressive process. Specifically, we reformulate the sampling
  process as solving a system of triangular nonlinear equations through fixed-point
  iteration. With this innovative formulation, we explore several systematic techniques
  to further reduce the iteration steps required by the solving process. Applying
  these techniques, we introduce ParaTAA, a universal and training-free parallel sampling
  algorithm that can leverage extra computational and memory resources to increase
  the sampling speed. Our experiments demonstrate that ParaTAA can decrease the inference
  steps required by common sequential sampling algorithms such as DDIM and DDPM by
  a factor of 4$\sim$14 times. Notably, when applying ParaTAA with 100 steps DDIM
  for Stable Diffusion, a widely-used text-to-image diffusion model, it can produce
  the same images as the sequential sampling in only 7 inference steps. The code is
  available at https://github.com/TZW1998/ParaTAA-Diffusion.
