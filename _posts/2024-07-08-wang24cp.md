title: Exploring Intrinsic Dimension for Vision-Language Model Pruning
openreview: xxL7CEWuxz
abstract: The intrinsic dimension (ID) represents the minimum dimension needed to
  describe data on a lower-dimensional manifold within high-dimensional spaces. Network
  pruning aims to reduce the complexity of high-dimensional networks while minimizing
  performance trade-offs. This symmetry motivates the exploration of ID as a metric
  for effective pruning. For vision-language models, we investigate whether different
  modalities exist on separate manifolds, indicating varying complexity and prunability.
  We empirically study ID variations in large-scale vision-language pre-trained models
  and examine the contributions of different modalities to model prunability. We propose
  a layer importance metric based on ID, which can conveniently integrate with current
  metrics and enhance performance in vision-language model pruning. The experimental
  results show a high correlation between ID and modality prunability. Visual representations
  are more sensitive and crucial to model performance, while language representations
  are more robust and offer greater prunability. Our findings suggest an asymmetric
  pruning strategy for vision and language modalities, guided by the ID metric. The
