title: 'Overestimation, Overfitting, and Plasticity in Actor-Critic: the Bitter Lesson
  of Reinforcement Learning'
openreview: 5vZzmCeTYu
abstract: Recent advancements in off-policy Reinforcement Learning (RL) have significantly
  improved sample efficiency, primarily due to the incorporation of various forms
  of regularization that enable more gradient update steps than traditional agents.
  However, many of these techniques have been tested in limited settings, often on
  tasks from single simulation benchmarks and against well-known algorithms rather
  than a range of regularization approaches. This limits our understanding of the
  specific mechanisms driving RL improvements. To address this, we implemented over
  60 different off-policy agents, each integrating established regularization techniques
  from recent state-of-the-art algorithms. We tested these agents across 14 diverse
  tasks from 2 simulation benchmarks, measuring training metrics related to overestimation,
  overfitting, and plasticity loss — issues that motivate the examined regularization
  techniques. Our findings reveal that while the effectiveness of a specific regularization
  setup varies with the task, certain combinations consistently demonstrate robust
  and superior performance. Notably, a simple Soft Actor-Critic agent, appropriately
  regularized, reliably finds a better-performing policy within the training regime,
  which previously was achieved mainly through model-based approaches.
