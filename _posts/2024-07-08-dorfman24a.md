title: 'Dynamic Byzantine-Robust Learning: Adapting to Switching Byzantine Workers'
openreview: NwYsuFuelg
abstract: Byzantine-robust learning has emerged as a prominent fault-tolerant distributed
  machine learning framework. However, most techniques focus on the <em>static</em>
  setting, wherein the identity of Byzantine workers remains unchanged throughout
  the learning process. This assumption fails to capture real-world <em>dynamic</em>
  Byzantine behaviors, which may include intermittent malfunctions or targeted, time-limited
  attacks. Addressing this limitation, we propose DynaBRO â€“ a new method capable of
  withstanding any sub-linear number of identity changes across rounds. Specifically,
  when the number of such changes is $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ (where $T$ is the total
  number of training rounds), DynaBRO nearly matches the state-of-the-art asymptotic
  convergence rate of the static setting. Our method utilizes a multi-level Monte
  Carlo (MLMC) gradient estimation technique applied at the server to robustly aggregated
  worker updates. By additionally leveraging an adaptive learning rate, we circumvent
  the need for prior knowledge of the fraction of Byzantine workers.
