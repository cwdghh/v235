title: Adaptive Robust Learning using Latent Bernoulli Variables
openreview: v6eaD7Wekw
abstract: We present an adaptive approach for robust learning from corrupted training
  sets. We identify corrupted and non-corrupted samples with latent Bernoulli variables
  and thus formulate the learning problem as maximization of the likelihood where
  latent variables are marginalized. The resulting problem is solved via variational
  inference, using an efficient Expectation-Maximization based method. The proposed
  approach improves over the state-of-the-art by automatically inferring the corruption
  level, while adding minimal computational overhead. We demonstrate our robust learning
  method and its parameter-free nature on a wide variety of machine learning tasks
  including online learning and deep learning where it adapts to different levels
  of noise and maintains high prediction accuracy.
