title: Graph-Triggered Rising Bandits
openreview: bPsohGR6gD
abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel generalization of rested and restless
  bandits where the evolution of the armsâ€™ expected rewards is governed by a graph
  defined over the arms. An edge connecting a pair of arms $(i,j)$ represents the
  fact that a pull of arm $i$ <em>triggers</em> the evolution of arm $j$, and vice
  versa. Interestingly, rested and restless bandits are both special cases of our
  model for some suitable (degenerate) graphs. Still, the model can represent way
  more general and interesting scenarios. We first tackle the problem of computing
  the optimal policy when no specific structure is assumed on the graph, showing that
  it is NP-hard. Then, we focus on a specific structure forcing the graph to be composed
  of a set of fully connected subgraphs (i.e., cliques), and we prove that the optimal
  policy can be easily computed in closed form. Then, we move to the learning problem
  presenting regret minimization algorithms for deterministic and stochastic cases.
  Our regret bounds highlight the complexity of the learning problem by incorporating
  instance-dependent terms that encode specific properties of the underlying graph
  structure. Moreover, we illustrate how the knowledge of the underlying graph is
  not necessary for achieving the no-regret property.
