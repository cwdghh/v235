title: Sample Average Approximation for Conditional Stochastic Optimization with Dependent
  Data
openreview: YuGnRORkJm
abstract: Conditional Stochastic Optimization (CSO) is a powerful modelling paradigm
  for optimization under uncertainty. The existing literature on CSO is mainly based
  on the independence assumption of data, which shows that the solution of CSO is
  asymptotically consistent and enjoys a finite sample guarantee. The independence
  assumption, however, does not typically hold in many important applications with
  dependence patterns, such as time series analysis, operational control, and reinforcement
  learning. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap and consider a Sample Average Approximation
  (SAA) for CSO with dependent data. Leveraging covariance inequalities and independent
  block sampling technique, we provide theoretical guarantees of SAA for CSO with
  dependent data. In particular, we show that SAA for CSO retains asymptotic consistency
  and a finite sample guarantee under mild conditions. In addition, we establish the
  sample complexity $O(d / \varepsilon^4)$ of SAA for CSO, which is shown to be of
  the same order as independent cases. Through experiments on several applications,
  we verify the theoretical results and demonstrate that dependence does not degrade
  the performance of the SAA approach in real data applications.
