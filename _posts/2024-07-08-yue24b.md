title: Federated Self-Explaining GNNs with Anti-shortcut Augmentations
openreview: ZxDqSBgFSM
abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
  graph classification tasks. However, ensuring the explainability of their predictions
  remains a challenge. To address this, graph rationalization methods have been introduced
  to generate concise subsets of the original graph, known as rationales, which serve
  to explain the predictions made by GNNs. Existing rationalizations often rely on
  shortcuts in data for prediction and rationale composition. In response, de-shortcut
  rationalization methods have been proposed, which commonly leverage counterfactual
  augmentation to enhance data diversity for mitigating the shortcut problem. Nevertheless,
  these methods have predominantly focused on centralized datasets and have not been
  extensively explored in the Federated Learning (FL) scenarios. To this end, in this
  paper, we propose a Federated Graph Rationalization (FedGR) with anti-shortcut augmentations
  to achieve self-explaining GNNs, which involves two data augmenters. These augmenters
  are employed to produce client-specific shortcut conflicted samples at each client,
  which contributes to mitigating the shortcut problem under the FL scenarios. Experiments
  on real-world benchmarks and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of FedGR
  under the FL scenarios.
