title: 'A Fresh Take on Stale Embeddings: Improving Dense Retriever Training with
  Corrector Networks'
openreview: ScRhEuj480
abstract: In dense retrieval, deep encoders provide embeddings for both inputs and
  targets, and the softmax function is used to parameterize a distribution over a
  large number of candidate targets (e.g., textual passages for information retrieval).
  Significant challenges arise in training such encoders in the increasingly prevalent
  scenario of (1) a large number of targets, (2) a computationally expensive target
  encoder model, (3) cached target embeddings that are out-of-date due to ongoing
  training of target encoder parameters. This paper presents a simple and highly scalable
  response to these challenges by training a small parametric <em>corrector network</em>
  that adjusts stale cached target embeddings, enabling an accurate softmax approximation
  and thereby sampling of up-to-date high scoring "hard negatives." We theoretically
  investigate the generalization properties of our proposed target corrector, relating
  the complexity of the network, staleness of cached representations, and the amount
  of training data. We present experimental results on large benchmark dense retrieval
  datasets as well as on QA with retrieval augmented language models. Our approach
  matches state-of-the-art results even when no target embedding updates are made
  during training beyond an initial cache from the unsupervised pre-trained model,
  providing a 4-80x reduction in re-embedding computational cost.
