title: 'Position: Key Claims in LLM Research Have a Long Tail of Footnotes'
openreview: M2cwkGleRL
abstract: Much of the recent discourse within the ML community has been centered around
  Large Language Models (LLMs), their functionality and potential – yet not only do
  we not have a working definition of LLMs, but much of this discourse relies on claims
  and assumptions that are worth re-examining. We contribute a definition of LLMs,
  critically examine five common claims regarding their properties (including ’emergent
  properties’), and conclude with suggestions for future research directions and their
  framing.
