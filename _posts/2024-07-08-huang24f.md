title: Contrastive Predict-and-Search for Mixed Integer Linear Programs
openreview: zatLnLvbs8
abstract: Mixed integer linear programs (MILP) are flexible and powerful tools for
  modeling and solving many difficult real-world combinatorial optimization problems.
  In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning (ML)-based framework ConPaS that
  learns to predict solutions to MILPs with contrastive learning. For training, we
  collect high-quality solutions as positive samples. We also collect low-quality
  or infeasible solutions as negative samples using novel optimization-based or sampling
  approaches. We then learn to make discriminative predictions by contrasting the
  positive and negative samples. During testing, we predict and fix the assignments
  for a subset of integer variables and then solve the resulting reduced MILP to find
  high-quality solutions. Empirically, ConPaS achieves state-of-the-art results compared
  to other ML-based approaches in terms of the quality of and the speed at which solutions
  are found.
