title: Faster Sampling via Stochastic Gradient Proximal Sampler
openreview: 7gEcbhMqKU
abstract: Stochastic gradients have been widely integrated into Langevin-based methods
  to improve their scalability and efficiency in solving large-scale sampling problems.
  However, the proximal sampler, which exhibits much faster convergence than Langevin-based
  algorithms in the deterministic setting (Lee et al., 2021), has yet to be explored
  in its stochastic variants. In this paper, we study the Stochastic Proximal Samplers
  (SPS) for sampling from non-log-concave distributions. We first establish a general
  framework for implementing stochastic proximal samplers and establish the convergence
  theory accordingly. We show that the convergence to the target distribution can
  be guaranteed as long as the second moment of the algorithm trajectory is bounded
  and restricted Gaussian oracles can be well approximated. We then provide two implementable
  variants based on Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) and Metropolis-adjusted
  Langevin algorithm (MALA), giving rise to SPS-SGLD and SPS-MALA. We further show
  that SPS-SGLD and SPS-MALA can achieve $\epsilon$-sampling error in total variation
  (TV) distance within $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\epsilon^{-2})$ and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{1/2}\epsilon^{-2})$
  gradient complexities, which outperform the best-known result by at least an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{1/3})$
  factor. This enhancement in performance is corroborated by our empirical studies
  on synthetic data with various dimensions, demonstrating the efficiency of our proposed
  algorithm.
