title: Kepler codebook
openreview: 5ILo43JIzg
abstract: A codebook designed for learning discrete distributions in latent space
  has demonstrated state-of-the-art results on generation tasks. This inspires us
  to explore what distribution of codebook is better. Following the spirit of Keplerâ€™s
  Conjecture, we cast the codebook training as solving the sphere packing problem
  and derive a Kepler codebook with a compact and structured distribution to obtain
  a codebook for image representations. Furthermore, we implement the Kepler codebook
  training by simply employing this derived distribution as regularization and using
  the codebook partition method. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate our
  trained codebook for image reconstruction and generation on natural and human face
  datasets, respectively, achieving significant performance improvement. Besides,
  our Kepler codebook has demonstrated superior performance when evaluated across
  datasets and even for reconstructing images with different resolutions. Our trained
  models and source codes will be publicly released.
