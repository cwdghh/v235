title: Sharpness-Aware Data Generation for Zero-shot Quantization
openreview: 8mKXMnhnFW
abstract: Zero-shot quantization aims to learn a quantized model from a pre-trained
  full-precision model with no access to original real training data. The common idea
  in zero-shot quantization approaches is to generate synthetic data for quantizing
  the full-precision model. While it is well-known that deep neural networks with
  low sharpness have better generalization ability, none of the previous zero-shot
  quantization works considers the sharpness of the quantized model as a criterion
  for generating training data. This paper introduces a novel methodology that takes
  into account quantized model sharpness in synthetic data generation to enhance generalization.
  Specifically, we first demonstrate that sharpness minimization can be attained by
  maximizing gradient matching between the reconstruction loss gradients computed
  on synthetic and real validation data, under certain assumptions. We then circumvent
  the problem of the gradient matching without real validation set by approximating
  it with the gradient matching between each generated sample and its neighbors. Experimental
  evaluations on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the superiority of the
  proposed method over the state-of-the-art techniques in low-bit quantization settings.
