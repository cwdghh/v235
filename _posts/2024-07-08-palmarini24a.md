title: Bayesian Program Learning by Decompiling Amortized Knowledge
openreview: CbIRQgAYE4
abstract: 'DreamCoder is an inductive program synthesis system that, whilst solving
  problems, learns to simplify search in an iterative wake-sleep procedure. The cost
  of search is amortized by training a neural search policy, reducing search breadth
  and effectively "compiling" useful information to compose program solutions across
  tasks. Additionally, a library of program components is learnt to compress and express
  discovered solutions in fewer components, reducing search depth. We present a novel
  approach for library learning that directly leverages the neural search policy,
  effectively "decompiling" its amortized knowledge to extract relevant program components.
  This provides stronger amortized inference: the amortized knowledge learnt to reduce
  search breadth is now also used to reduce search depth. We integrate our approach
  with DreamCoder and demonstrate faster domain proficiency with improved generalization
  on a range of domains, particularly when fewer example solutions are available.'
