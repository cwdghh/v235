title: Variational Inference with Coverage Guarantees in Simulation-Based Inference
openreview: Wn4QwCrDvH
abstract: 'Amortized variational inference is an often employed framework in simulation-based
  inference that produces a posterior approximation that can be rapidly computed given
  any new observation. Unfortunately, there are few guarantees about the quality of
  these approximate posteriors. We propose Conformalized Amortized Neural Variational
  Inference (CANVI), a procedure that is scalable, easily implemented, and provides
  guaranteed marginal coverage. Given a collection of candidate amortized posterior
  approximators, CANVI constructs conformalized predictors based on each candidate,
  compares the predictors using a metric known as predictive efficiency, and returns
  the most efficient predictor. CANVI ensures that the resulting predictor constructs
  regions that contain the truth with a user-specified level of probability. CANVI
  is agnostic to design decisions in formulating the candidate approximators and only
  requires access to samples from the forward model, permitting its use in likelihood-free
  settings. We prove lower bounds on the predictive efficiency of the regions produced
  by CANVI and explore how the quality of a posterior approximation relates to the
  predictive efficiency of prediction regions based on that approximation. Finally,
  we demonstrate the accurate calibration and high predictive efficiency of CANVI
  on a suite of simulation-based inference benchmark tasks and an important scientific
  task: analyzing galaxy emission spectra.'
