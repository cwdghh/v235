title: 'LongRoPE: Extending LLM Context Window Beyond 2 Million Tokens'
openreview: ONOtpXLqqw
abstract: 'Large context window is a desirable feature in large language models (LLMs).
  However, due to high fine-tuning costs, scarcity of long texts, and catastrophic
  values introduced by new token positions, current extended context windows are limited
  to around 128k tokens. This paper introduces LongRoPE that, for the first time,
  extends the context window of pre-trained LLMs to an impressive 2048k tokens, with
  up to only 1k fine-tuning steps at within 256k training lengths, while maintaining
  performance at the original short context window. This is achieved by three key
  innovations: (i) we identify and exploit two forms of non-uniformities in positional
  interpolation through an efficient search, providing a better initialization for
  fine-tuning and enabling an 8x extension in non-fine-tuning scenarios; (ii) we introduce
  a progressive extension strategy that first fine-tunes a 256k length LLM and then
  conducts a second positional interpolation on the fine-tuned extended LLM to achieve
  a 2048k context window; (iii) we readjust LongRoPE on 8k length to recover the short
  context window performance. Extensive experiments on LLaMA2 and Mistral across various
  tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Models extended via LongRoPE
  retain the original architecture with minor modifications to the positional embedding,
  and can reuse most pre-existing optimizations. Code is available at https://github.com/microsoft/LongRoPE'
