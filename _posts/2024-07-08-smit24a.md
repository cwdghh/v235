title: Should we be going MAD? A Look at Multi-Agent Debate Strategies for LLMs
openreview: CrUmgUaAQp
abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore their potential
  for responding to inquiries in various domains. However, ensuring that generative
  agents provide accurate and reliable answers remains an ongoing challenge. In this
  context, multi-agent debate (MAD) has emerged as a promising strategy for enhancing
  the truthfulness of LLMs. We benchmark a range of debating and prompting strategies
  to explore the trade-offs between cost, time, and accuracy. Importantly, we find
  that multi-agent debating systems, in their current form, do not reliably outperform
  other proposed prompting strategies, such as self-consistency and ensembling using
  multiple reasoning paths. However, when performing hyperparameter tuning, several
  MAD systems, such as Multi-Persona, perform better. This suggests that MAD protocols
  might not be inherently worse than other approaches, but that they are more sensitive
  to different hyperparameter settings and difficult to optimize. We build on these
  results to offer insights into improving debating strategies, such as adjusting
  agent agreement levels, which can significantly enhance performance and even surpass
  all other non-debate protocols we evaluated. We provide an open-source repository
  to the community with several state-of-the-art protocols together with evaluation
  scripts to benchmark across popular research datasets.
