title: 'X-Oscar: A Progressive Framework for High-quality Text-guided 3D Animatable
  Avatar Generation'
openreview: AYbXN9poJl
abstract: 'Recent advancements in automatic 3D avatar generation guided by text have
  made significant progress. However, existing methods have limitations such as oversaturation
  and low-quality output. To address these challenges, we propose X-Oscar, a progressive
  framework for generating high-quality animatable avatars from text prompts. It follows
  a sequential "Geometry→Texture→Animation" paradigm, simplifying optimization through
  step-by-step generation. To tackle oversaturation, we introduce Adaptive Variational
  Parameter (AVP), representing avatars as an adaptive distribution during training.
  Additionally, we present Avatar-aware Score Distillation Sampling (ASDS), a novel
  technique that incorporates avatar-aware noise into rendered images for improved
  generation quality during optimization. Extensive evaluations confirm the superiority
  of X-Oscar over existing text-to-3D and text-to-avatar approaches. Our anonymous
