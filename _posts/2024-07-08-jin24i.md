title: 'Position: What Can Large Language Models Tell Us about Time Series Analysis'
openreview: iroZNDxFJZ
abstract: Time series analysis is essential for comprehending the complexities inherent
  in various real-world systems and applications. Although large language models (LLMs)
  have recently made significant strides, the development of artificial general intelligence
  (AGI) equipped with time series analysis capabilities remains in its nascent phase.
  Most existing time series models heavily rely on domain knowledge and extensive
  model tuning, predominantly focusing on prediction tasks. In this paper, we argue
  that current LLMs have the potential to revolutionize time series analysis, thereby
  promoting efficient decision-making and advancing towards a more universal form
  of time series analytical intelligence. Such advancement could unlock a wide range
  of possibilities, including time series modality switching and question answering.
  We encourage researchers and practitioners to recognize the potential of LLMs in
  advancing time series analysis and emphasize the need for trust in these related
  efforts. Furthermore, we detail the seamless integration of time series analysis
  with existing LLM technologies and outline promising avenues for future research.
