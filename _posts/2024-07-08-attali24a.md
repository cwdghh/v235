title: 'Delaunay Graph: Addressing Over-Squashing and Over-Smoothing Using Delaunay
  Triangulation'
openreview: uyhjKoaIQa
abstract: GNNs rely on the exchange of messages to distribute information along the
  edges of the graph. This approach makes the efficiency of architectures highly dependent
  on the specific structure of the input graph. Certain graph topologies lead to inefficient
  information propagation, resulting in a phenomenon known as over-squashing. While
  the majority of existing methods address over-squashing by rewiring the input graph,
  our novel approach involves constructing a graph directly from features using Delaunay
  Triangulation. We posit that the topological properties of the resulting graph prove
  advantageous for mitigate oversmoothing and over-squashing. Our extensive experimentation
  demonstrates that our method consistently outperforms established graph rewiring
  methods.
