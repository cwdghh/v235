title: Local Causal Structure Learning in the Presence of Latent Variables
openreview: 3KMMPxrAk5
abstract: Discovering causal relationships from observational data, particularly in
  the presence of latent variables, poses a challenging problem. While current local
  structure learning methods have proven effective and efficient when the focus lies
  solely on the local relationships of a target variable, they operate under the assumption
  of causal sufficiency. This assumption implies that all the common causes of the
  measured variables are observed, leaving no room for latent variables. Such a premise
  can be easily violated in various real-world applications, resulting in inaccurate
  structures that may adversely impact downstream tasks. In light of this, our paper
  delves into the primary investigation of locally identifying potential parents and
  children of a target from observational data that may include latent variables.
  Specifically, we harness the causal information from m-separation and V-structures
  to derive theoretical consistency results, effectively bridging the gap between
  global and local structure learning. Together with the newly developed stop rules,
  we present a principled method for determining whether a variable is a direct cause
  or effect of a target. Further, we theoretically demonstrate the correctness of
  our approach under the standard causal Markov and faithfulness conditions, with
  infinite samples. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world data validate
  the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.
