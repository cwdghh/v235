title: Domain-wise Data Acquisition to Improve Performance under Distribution Shift
openreview: 0j28mmQ023
abstract: Despite notable progress in enhancing the capability of machine learning
  against distribution shifts, training data quality remains a bottleneck for cross-distribution
  generalization. Recently, from a data-centric perspective, there have been considerable
  efforts to improve model performance through refining the preparation of training
  data. Inspired by realistic scenarios, this paper addresses a practical requirement
  of acquiring training samples from various domains on a limited budget to facilitate
  model generalization to target test domain with distribution shift. Our empirical
  evidence indicates that the advance in data acquisition can significantly benefit
  the model performance on shifted data. Additionally, by leveraging unlabeled test
  domain data, we introduce a Domain-wise Active Acquisition framework. This framework
  iteratively optimizes the data acquisition strategy as training samples are accumulated,
  theoretically ensuring the effective approximation of test distribution. Extensive
  real-world experiments demonstrate our proposalâ€™s advantages in machine learning
  applications. The code is available at https://github.com/dongbaili/DAA.
