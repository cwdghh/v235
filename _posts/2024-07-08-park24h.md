title: 'SignSGD with Federated Defense: Harnessing Adversarial Attacks through Gradient
  Sign Decoding'
openreview: zEqeNEuiJr
abstract: Distributed learning is an effective approach to accelerate model training
  by using parallel computing power of multiple workers. However, substantial communication
  delays arise between workers and a parameter server due to the massive costs associated
  with communicating gradients. SignSGD with majority voting (signSGD-MV) is a simple
  yet effective optimizer that reduces communication costs through sign quantization,
  but its convergence rate significantly decreases when adversarial workers arbitrarily
  manipulate datasets or local gradient updates. In this paper, we consider a distributed
  learning problem where the workforce comprises a mixture of honest and adversarial
  workers. In this setting, we show that the convergence rate can remain invariant
  as long as the number of honest workers providing trustworthy local updates to the
  parameter server exceeds the number of adversarial workers. The key idea behind
  this counter-intuitive result is our novel aggregation method, signSGD with federated
  defense (signSGD-FD). Unlike traditional approaches, signSGD-FD utilizes the gradient
  information sent by adversarial workers with appropriate weights, obtained through
  gradient sign decoding. Experimental results demonstrate that signSGD-FD achieves
  superior convergence rates compared to traditional algorithms in various adversarial
  attack scenarios.
