title: 'AND: Audio Network Dissection for Interpreting Deep Acoustic Models'
openreview: YvAyOYeGlo
abstract: Neuron-level interpretations aim to explain network behaviors and properties
  by investigating neurons responsive to specific perceptual or structural input patterns.
  Although there is emerging work in the vision and language domains, none is explored
  for acoustic models. To bridge the gap, we introduce <em>AND</em>, the first <b>A</b>udio
  <b>N</b>etwork <b>D</b>issection framework that automatically establishes natural
  language explanations of acoustic neurons based on highly responsive audio. <em>AND</em>
  features the use of LLMs to summarize mutual acoustic features and identities among
  audio. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify <em>AND</em>â€™s precise and
  informative descriptions. In addition, we highlight two acoustic model behaviors
  with analysis by <em>AND</em>. First, models discriminate audio with a combination
  of basic acoustic features rather than high-level abstract concepts. Second, training
  strategies affect neuron behaviors. Supervised training guides neurons to gradually
  narrow their attention, while self-supervised learning encourages neurons to be
  polysemantic for exploring high-level features. Finally, we demonstrate a potential
  use of <em>AND</em> in audio model unlearning by conducting concept-specific pruning
  based on the descriptions.
