title: Discovering Environments with XRM
openreview: gPStP3FSY9
abstract: Environment annotations are essential for the success of many out-of-distribution
  (OOD) generalization methods. Unfortunately, these are costly to obtain and often
  limited by human annotatorsâ€™ biases. To achieve robust generalization, it is essential
  to develop algorithms for automatic environment discovery within datasets. Current
  proposals, which divide examples based on their training error, suffer from one
  fundamental problem. These methods introduce hyper-parameters and early-stopping
  criteria, which require a validation set with human-annotated environments, the
  very information subject to discovery. In this paper, we propose Cross-Risk Minimization
  (XRM) to address this issue. XRM trains twin networks, each learning from one random
  half of the training data, while imitating confident held-out mistakes made by its
  sibling. XRM provides a recipe for hyper-parameter tuning, does not require early-stopping,
  and can discover environments for all training and validation data. Algorithms built
  on top of XRM environments achieve oracle worst-group-accuracy, addressing a long-standing
  challenge in OOD generalization.
