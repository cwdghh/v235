title: 'tnGPS: Discovering Unknown Tensor Network Structure Search Algorithms via
  Large Language Models (LLMs)'
openreview: LVgT0ShxN5
abstract: Tensor networks are efficient for extremely high-dimensional representation,
  but their model selection, known as tensor network structure search (TN-SS), is
  a challenging problem. Although several works have targeted TN-SS, most existing
  algorithms are manually crafted heuristics with poor performance, suffering from
  the curse of dimensionality and local convergence. In this work, we jump out of
  the box, studying how to harness large language models (LLMs) to automatically discover
  new TN-SS algorithms, replacing the involvement of human experts. By observing how
  human experts innovate in research, we model their common workflow and propose an
  automatic algorithm discovery framework called tnGPS. The proposed framework is
  an elaborate prompting pipeline that instruct LLMs to generate new TN-SS algorithms
  through iterative refinement and enhancement. The experimental results demonstrate
  that the algorithms discovered by tnGPS exhibit superior performance in benchmarks
  compared to the current state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/ChaoLiAtRIKEN/tngps.
