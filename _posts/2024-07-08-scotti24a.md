title: 'MindEye2: Shared-Subject Models Enable fMRI-To-Image With 1 Hour of Data'
openreview: 65XKBGH5PO
abstract: 'Reconstructions of visual perception from brain activity have improved
  tremendously, but the practical utility of such methods has been limited. This is
  because such models are trained independently per subject where each subject requires
  dozens of hours of expensive fMRI training data to attain high-quality results.
  The present work showcases high-quality reconstructions using only 1 hour of fMRI
  training data. We pretrain our model across 7 subjects and then fine-tune on minimal
  data from a new subject. Our novel functional alignment procedure linearly maps
  all brain data to a shared-subject latent space, followed by a shared non-linear
  mapping to CLIP image space. We then map from CLIP space to pixel space by fine-tuning
  Stable Diffusion XL to accept CLIP latents as inputs instead of text. This approach
  improves out-of-subject generalization with limited training data and also attains
  state-of-the-art image retrieval and reconstruction metrics compared to single-subject
  approaches. MindEye2 demonstrates how accurate reconstructions of perception are
  possible from a single visit to the MRI facility. All code is available on Github:
