title: Monotone, Bi-Lipschitz, and Polyak-Łojasiewicz Networks
openreview: kn2xp8UOvQ
abstract: This paper presents a new <em>bi-Lipschitz</em> invertible neural network,
  the BiLipNet, which has the ability to smoothly control both its <em>Lipschitzness</em>
  (output sensitivity to input perturbations) and <em>inverse Lipschitzness</em> (input
  distinguishability from different outputs). The second main contribution is a new
  scalar-output network, the PLNet, which is a composition of a BiLipNet and a quadratic
  potential. We show that PLNet satisfies the Polyak-Łojasiewicz condition and can
  be applied to learn non-convex surrogate losses with a unique and efficiently-computable
  global minimum. The central technical element in these networks is a novel invertible
  residual layer with certified strong monotonicity and Lipschitzness, which we compose
  with orthogonal layers to build the BiLipNet. The certification of these properties
  is based on incremental quadratic constraints, resulting in much tighter bounds
  than can be achieved with spectral normalization. Moreover, we formulate the calculation
  of the inverse of a BiLipNet – and hence the minimum of a PLNet – as a series of
  three-operator splitting problems, for which fast algorithms can be applied.
