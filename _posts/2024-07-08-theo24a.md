title: A New Branch-and-Bound Pruning Framework for $\ell_0$-Regularized Problems
openreview: xPmSNLle1w
abstract: We consider the resolution of learning problems involving $\ell_0$-regularization
  via Branch-and- Bound (BnB) algorithms. These methods explore regions of the feasible
  space of the problem and check whether they do not contain solutions through “pruning
  tests”. In standard implementations, evaluating a pruning test requires to solve
  a convex optimization problem, which may result in computational bottlenecks. In
  this paper, we present an alternative to implement pruning tests for some generic
  family of $\ell_0$-regularized problems. Our proposed procedure allows the simultaneous
  assessment of several regions and can be embedded in standard BnB implementations
  with a negligible computational overhead. We show through numerical simulations
  that our pruning strategy can improve the solving time of BnB procedures by several
  orders of magnitude for typical problems encountered in machine-learning applications.
