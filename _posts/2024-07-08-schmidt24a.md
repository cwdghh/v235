title: 'Tilt your Head: Activating the Hidden Spatial-Invariance of Classifiers'
openreview: 5PqzKxmfag
abstract: 'Deep neural networks are applied in more and more areas of everyday life.
  However, they still lack essential abilities, such as robustly dealing with spatially
  transformed input signals. Approaches to mitigate this severe robustness issue are
  limited to two pathways: Either models are implicitly regularised by increased sample
  variability (data augmentation) or explicitly constrained by hard-coded inductive
  biases. The limiting factor of the former is the size of the data space, which renders
  sufficient sample coverage intractable. The latter is limited by the engineering
  effort required to develop such inductive biases for every possible scenario. Instead,
  we take inspiration from human behaviour, where percepts are modified by mental
  or physical actions during inference. We propose a novel technique to emulate such
  an inference process for neural nets. This is achieved by traversing a sparsified
  inverse transformation tree during inference using parallel energy-based evaluations.
  Our proposed inference algorithm, called Inverse Transformation Search (ITS), is
  model-agnostic and equips the model with zero-shot pseudo-invariance to spatially
  transformed inputs. We evaluated our method on several benchmark datasets, including
  a synthesised ImageNet test set. ITS outperforms the utilised baselines on all zero-shot
  test scenarios.'
