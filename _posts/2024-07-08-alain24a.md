title: Gaussian Processes on Cellular Complexes
openreview: afnyJfQddk
abstract: In recent years, there has been considerable interest in developing machine
  learning models on graphs to account for topological inductive biases. In particular,
  recent attention has been given to Gaussian processes on such structures since they
  can additionally account for uncertainty. However, graphs are limited to modelling
  relations between two vertices. In this paper, we go beyond this dyadic setting
  and consider polyadic relations that include interactions between vertices, edges
  and one of their generalisations, known as cells. Specifically, we propose Gaussian
  processes on cellular complexes, a generalisation of graphs that captures interactions
  between these higher-order cells. One of our key contributions is the derivation
  of two novel kernels, one that generalises the graph Mat√©rn kernel and one that
  additionally mixes information of different cell types.
