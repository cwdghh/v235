title: Generating Chain-of-Thoughts with a Pairwise-Comparison Approach to Searching
  for the Most Promising Intermediate Thought
openreview: CpcaL75UgY
abstract: To improve the ability of the large language model (LLMs) to tackle complex
  reasoning problems, chain-of-thoughts (CoT) methods were proposed to guide LLMs
  to reason step-by-step, enabling problem solving from simple to complex. State-of-the-art
  methods for generating such a chain involve interactive collaboration, where the
  learner generates candidate intermediate thoughts, evaluated by the LLM, guiding
  the generation of subsequent thoughts. However, a widespread yet understudied problem
  is that the evaluation from the LLM is typically noisy and unreliable, potentially
  misleading the generation process in selecting promising intermediate thoughts.
  In this paper, motivated by Vapnikâ€™s principle, we use pairwise-comparison evaluation
  instead of point-wise scoring to search for promising intermediate thoughts with
  the noisy feedback from the LLM. In each round, we randomly pair intermediate thoughts
  and directly prompt the LLM to select the more promising one from each pair, allowing
  us to identify the most promising thoughts through an iterative process. To further
  alleviate the noise in the comparison, we incorporate techniques from ensemble learning
  and dueling bandits, proposing two variants of the algorithm. Experiments on three
  real-world tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and verify
  the rationale of the pairwise comparison mechanism.
