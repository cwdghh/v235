title: Boosting Offline Optimizers with Surrogate Sensitivity
openreview: aLSA3JH08h
abstract: 'Offline optimization is an important task in numerous material engineering
  domains where online experimentation to collect data is too expensive and needs
  to be replaced by an in silico maximization of a surrogate of the black-box function.
  Although such a surrogate can be learned from offline data, its prediction might
  not be reliable outside the offline data regime, which happens when the surrogate
  has narrow prediction margin and is (therefore) sensitive to small perturbations
  of its parameterization. This raises the following questions: (1) how to regulate
  the sensitivity of a surrogate model; and (2) whether conditioning an offline optimizer
  with such less sensitive surrogate will lead to better optimization performance.
  To address these questions, we develop an optimizable sensitivity measurement for
  the surrogate model, which then inspires a sensitivity-informed regularizer that
  is applicable to a wide range of offline optimizers. This development is both orthogonal
  and synergistic to prior research on offline optimization, which is demonstrated
  in our extensive experiment benchmark.'
