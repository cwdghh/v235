title: 'S3O: A Dual-Phase Approach for Reconstructing Dynamic Shape and Skeleton of
  Articulated Objects from Single Monocular Video'
openreview: xcyKKACmSd
abstract: 'Reconstructing dynamic articulated objects from a singular monocular video
  is challenging, requiring joint estimation of shape, motion, and camera parameters
  from limited views. Current methods typically demand extensive computational resources
  and training time, and require additional human annotations such as predefined parametric
  models, camera poses, and key points, limiting their generalizability. We propose
  Synergistic Shape and Skeleton Optimization (S3O), a novel two-phase method that
  forgoes these prerequisites and efficiently learns parametric models including visible
  shapes and underlying skeletons. Conventional strategies typically learn all parameters
  simultaneously, leading to interdependencies where a single incorrect prediction
  can result in significant errors. In contrast, S3O adopts a phased approach: it
  first focuses on learning coarse parametric models, then progresses to motion learning
  and detail addition. This method substantially lowers computational complexity and
  enhances robustness in reconstruction from limited viewpoints, all without requiring
  additional annotations. To address the current inadequacies in 3D reconstruction
  from monocular video benchmarks, we collected the PlanetZoo dataset. Our experimental
  evaluations on standard benchmarks and the PlanetZoo dataset affirm that S3O provides
  more accurate 3D reconstruction, and plausible skeletons, and reduces the training
  time by approximately 60% compared to the state-of-the-art, thus advancing the state
  of the art in dynamic object reconstruction.'
