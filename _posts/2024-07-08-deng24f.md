title: Network Tight Community Detection
openreview: XQz7ytgETQ
abstract: Conventional community detection methods often categorize all nodes into
  clusters. However, the presumed community structure of interest may only be valid
  for a subset of nodes (named as ‘tight nodes’), while the rest of the network may
  consist of noninformative “scattered nodes”. For example, a protein-protein network
  often contains proteins that do not belong to specific biological functional modules
  but are involved in more general processes, or act as bridges between different
  functional modules. Forcing each of these proteins into a single cluster introduces
  unwanted biases and obscures the underlying biological implication. To address this
  issue, we propose a tight community detection (TCD) method to identify tight communities
  excluding scattered nodes. The algorithm enjoys a strong theoretical guarantee of
  tight node identification accuracy and is scalable for large networks. The superiority
  of the proposed method is demonstrated by various synthetic and real experiments.
