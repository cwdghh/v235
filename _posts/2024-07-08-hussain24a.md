title: 'Triplet Interaction Improves Graph Transformers: Accurate Molecular Graph
  Learning with Triplet Graph Transformers'
openreview: iPFuWc1TV2
abstract: Graph transformers typically lack third-order interactions, limiting their
  geometric understanding which is crucial for tasks like molecular geometry prediction.
  We propose the Triplet Graph Transformer (TGT) that enables direct communication
  between pairs within a 3-tuple of nodes via novel triplet attention and aggregation
  mechanisms. TGT is applied to molecular property prediction by first predicting
  interatomic distances from 2D graphs and then using these distances for downstream
  tasks. A novel three-stage training procedure and stochastic inference further improve
  training efficiency and model performance. Our model achieves new state-of-the-art
  (SOTA) results on open challenge benchmarks PCQM4Mv2 and OC20 IS2RE. We also obtain
  SOTA results on QM9, MOLPCBA, and LIT-PCBA molecular property prediction benchmarks
  via transfer learning. We also demonstrate the generality of TGT with SOTA results
  on the traveling salesman problem (TSP).
