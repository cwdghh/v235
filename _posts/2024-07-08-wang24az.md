title: 'TroVE: Inducing Verifiable and Efficient Toolboxes for Solving Programmatic
  Tasks'
openreview: DCNCwaMJjI
abstract: Language models (LMs) can solve tasks such as answering questions about
  tables or images by writing programs. However, using primitive functions often leads
  to verbose and error-prone programs, and higher-level functions require expert design.
  To enable better solutions without human labor, we ask code LMs to curate reusable
  high-level functions, and use them to write solutions. We present TROVE, a training-free
  method of inducing a verifiable and efficient toolbox of functions, by generating
  via using, growing, and periodically trimming the toolbox. On 11 datasets from math,
  table question answering, and image reasoning tasks, TROVE consistently yields simpler
  solutions with higher accuracy than baselines using CodeLLaMa and previous methods
  using GPT, while using 79-98% smaller toolboxes. TROVE further enables 31% faster
  and 13% more accurate human verification than baselines. With the same pipeline,
  it creates diverse functions for varied tasks and datasets, providing insights into
  their individual characteristics.
