title: Fine-grained Classes and How to Find Them
openreview: b9VfvegTEO
abstract: In many practical applications, coarse-grained labels are readily available
  compared to fine-grained labels that reflect subtle differences between classes.
  However, existing methods cannot leverage coarse labels to infer fine-grained labels
  in an unsupervised manner. To bridge this gap, we propose FALCON, a method that
  discovers fine-grained classes from coarsely labeled data without any supervision
  at the fine-grained level. FALCON simultaneously infers unknown fine-grained classes
  and underlying relationships between coarse and fine-grained classes. Moreover,
  FALCON is a modular method that can effectively learn from multiple datasets labeled
  with different strategies. We evaluate FALCON on eight image classification tasks
  and a single-cell classification task. FALCON outperforms baselines by a large margin,
  achieving 22% improvement over the best baseline on the tieredImageNet dataset with
  over 600 fine-grained classes.
