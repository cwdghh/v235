title: 'FreeBind: Free Lunch in Unified Multimodal Space via Knowledge Fusion'
openreview: 3XG69ZmfsB
abstract: 'Unified multi-model representation spaces are the foundation of multimodal
  understanding and generation. However, the billions of model parameters and catastrophic
  forgetting problems make it challenging to further enhance pre-trained unified spaces.
  In this work, we propose FreeBind, an idea that treats multimodal representation
  spaces as basic units, and freely augments pre-trained unified space by integrating
  knowledge from extra expert spaces via â€œspace bonds". Specifically, we introduce
  two kinds of basic space bonds: 1) Space Displacement Bond and 2) Space Combination
  Bond. Based on these basic bonds, we design Complex Sequential & Parallel Bonds
  to effectively integrate multiple spaces simultaneously. Benefiting from the modularization
  concept, we further propose a coarse-to-fine customized inference strategy to flexibly
  adjust the enhanced unified space for different purposes. Experimentally, we bind
  ImageBind with extra image-text and audio-text expert spaces, resulting in three
  main variants: ImageBind++, InternVL_IB, and InternVL_IB++. These resulting spaces
  outperform ImageBind on 5 audio-image-text downstream tasks across 9 datasets. Moreover,
  via customized inference, it even surpasses the advanced audio-text and image-text
  expert spaces. Our code and checkpoints are released at https://github.com/zehanwang01/FreeBind'
