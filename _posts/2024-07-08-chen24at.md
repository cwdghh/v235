title: 'AutoOS: Make Your OS More Powerful by Exploiting Large Language Models'
openreview: Rp8R9C0Sth
abstract: With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT),
  customizing and optimizing operating system (OS) kernel configurations for various
  AIoT application scenarios is crucial for maximizing system performance. However,
  existing approaches falter due to the overwhelming problem complexity (i.e., over
  15,000 configuration options in the Linux kernel), together with the huge evaluation
  costs and error-prone options that may result in OS boot-up failure, which all make
  it an unresolved problem to optimize the Linux kernel automatically. In this paper,
  we introduce AutoOS, a novel framework exploiting Large Language Models for customizing
  and optimizing OS kernel configurations automatically for various AIoT application
  scenarios.Inspired by the inherently directory-structured kernel configuration process,
  we first formulate our research problem as optimizing on a dynamic tree. We then
  propose a novel framework integrating a state machine-based traversal algorithm
  as the observe-prune-propose-act-correct loop, which can effectively refine the
  optimization space and ensure a successful OS boot-up.Experimental results show
  that AutoOS can automatically customize and optimize the OS kernel configurations
  without human effort. More importantly, AutoOS even achieves better performance
  by up to 25% than vendor-provided configuration.
