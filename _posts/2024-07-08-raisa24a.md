title: 'Subsampling is not Magic: Why Large Batch Sizes Work for Differentially Private
  Stochastic Optimisation'
openreview: gTBjkJvadC
abstract: We study how the batch size affects the total gradient variance in differentially
  private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), seeking a theoretical explanation
  for the usefulness of large batch sizes. As DP-SGD is the basis of modern DP deep
  learning, its properties have been widely studied, and recent works have empirically
  found large batch sizes to be beneficial. However, theoretical explanations of this
  benefit are currently heuristic at best. We first observe that the total gradient
  variance in DP-SGD can be decomposed into subsampling-induced and noise-induced
  variances. We then prove that in the limit of an infinite number of iterations,
  the effective noise-induced variance is invariant to the batch size. The remaining
  subsampling-induced variance decreases with larger batch sizes, so large batches
  reduce the effective total gradient variance. We confirm numerically that the asymptotic
  regime is relevant in practical settings when the batch size is not small, and find
  that outside the asymptotic regime, the total gradient variance decreases even more
  with large batch sizes. We also find a sufficient condition that implies that large
  batch sizes similarly reduce effective DP noise variance for one iteration of DP-SGD.
