title: Quality-Weighted Vendi Scores And Their Application To Diverse Experimental
  Design
openreview: gbD9MAc9p0
abstract: Experimental design techniques such as active search and Bayesian optimization
  are widely used in the natural sciences for data collection and discovery. However,
  existing techniques tend to favor exploitation over exploration of the search space,
  which causes them to get stuck in local optima. This <em>collapse</em> problem prevents
  experimental design algorithms from yielding diverse high-quality data. In this
  paper, we extend the Vendi scores—a family of interpretable similarity-based diversity
  metrics—to account for quality. We then leverage these <em>quality-weighted Vendi
  scores</em> to tackle experimental design problems across various applications,
  including drug discovery, materials discovery, and reinforcement learning. We found
  that quality-weighted Vendi scores allow us to construct policies for experimental
  design that flexibly balance quality and diversity, and ultimately assemble rich
  and diverse sets of high-performing data points. Our algorithms led to a 70%–170%
  increase in the number of effective discoveries compared to baselines.
