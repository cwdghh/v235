title: Verification of Machine Unlearning is Fragile
openreview: OkChMnjF6s
abstract: 'As privacy concerns escalate in the realm of machine learning, data owners
  now have the option to utilize machine unlearning to remove their data from machine
  learning models, following recent legislation. To enhance transparency in machine
  unlearning and avoid potential dishonesty by model providers, various verification
  strategies have been proposed. These strategies enable data owners to ascertain
  whether their target data has been effectively unlearned from the model. However,
  our understanding of the safety issues of machine unlearning verification remains
  nascent. In this paper, we explore the novel research question of whether model
  providers can circumvent verification strategies while retaining the information
  of data supposedly unlearned. Our investigation leads to a pessimistic answer: the
  verification of machine unlearning is fragile. Specifically, we categorize the current
  verification strategies regarding potential dishonesty among model providers into
  two types. Subsequently, we introduce two novel adversarial unlearning processes
  capable of circumventing both types. We validate the efficacy of our methods through
  theoretical analysis and empirical experiments using real-world datasets. This study
  highlights the vulnerabilities and limitations in machine unlearning verification,
  paving the way for further research into the safety of machine unlearning.'
