title: Localizing Task Information for Improved Model Merging and Compression
openreview: DWT9uiGjxT
abstract: Model merging and task arithmetic have emerged as promising scalable approaches
  to merge multiple single-task checkpoints to one multi-task model, but their applicability
  is reduced by significant performance loss. Previous works have linked these drops
  to interference in the weight space and erasure of important task-specific features.
  Instead, in this work we show that the information required to solve each task is
  still preserved after merging as different tasks mostly use non-overlapping sets
  of weights. We propose TALL-masks, a method to identify these task supports given
  a collection of task vectors and show that one can retrieve $>$99% of the single
  task accuracy by applying our masks to the multi-task vector, effectively compressing
  the individual checkpoints. We study the statistics of intersections among constructed
  masks and reveal the existence of selfish and catastrophic weights, i.e., parameters
  that are important exclusively to one task and irrelevant to all tasks but detrimental
  to multi-task fusion. For this reason, we propose Consensus Merging, an algorithm
  that eliminates such weights and improves the general performance of existing model
  merging approaches. Our experiments in vision and NLP benchmarks with up to 20 tasks,
  show that Consensus Merging consistently improves existing approaches. Furthermore,
  our proposed compression scheme reduces storage from 57Gb to 8.2Gb while retaining
  99.7% of original performance.
