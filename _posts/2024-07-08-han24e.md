title: 'SIN: Selective and Interpretable Normalization for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting'
openreview: cUMOVfOIve
abstract: 'In real-world applications, time series data frequently exhibit non-stationarity,
  with statistics changing over time. This variability undermines the forecasting
  accuracy of deep learning models that are trained on historical data but deployed
  for future prediction. A common approach to mitigate this issue involves normalizing
  the data to counteract statistical drift, followed by denormalization on the prediction.
  However, existing methods often employ heuristic normalization techniques that do
  not fully account for the unique characteristics of the series. Our paper addresses
  the critical question in this context: which statistics should be removed and restored?
  We argue that the statistics selected for normalization should exhibit both local
  invariance and global variability to ensure their correctness and helpfulness. To
  this end, we propose the Selective and Interpretable Normalization methodology,
  dubbed SIN. This approach maximizes the covariance between a given look-back window
  and its subsequent future values, thereby identifying key statistics for normalization
  and simultaneously learning the corresponding normalization transformations. The
  interpretable framework can be used to explain the success and limitations of some
  popular normalization methods. By integrating SIN, we demonstrate improvements in
  the performance of several prevalent forecasting models, thereby validating the
  utility of our approach.'
