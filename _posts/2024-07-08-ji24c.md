title: Towards Efficient Exact Optimization of Language Model Alignment
openreview: 66k81s33p3
abstract: The alignment of language models with human preferences is vital for their
  application in real-world tasks. The problem is formulated as optimizing the modelâ€™s
  policy to maximize the expected reward that reflects human preferences with minimal
  deviation from the initial policy. While considered as a straightforward solution,
  reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from high variance in policy updates, which
  impedes efficient policy improvement. Recently, direct preference optimization (DPO)
  was proposed to directly optimize the policy from preference data. However, we show
  that DPO derived based on the optimal solution of the problem leads to a compromised
  mean-seeking approximation of the optimal solution in practice. In this paper, we
  propose efficient exact optimization (EXO) of the alignment objective. EXO is guaranteed
  to optimize in the same direction as RL algorithms asymptotically for arbitrary
  policy parametrization. This leads to the same mode-seeking solution, while enables
  efficient optimization by circumventing the complexities of RL. We also compare
  our method to DPO with both theoretical and empirical analyses, and further demonstrate
  the advantages of our method over existing approaches on realistic human preference
  data. Code is available at https://github.com/haozheji/exact-optimization.
