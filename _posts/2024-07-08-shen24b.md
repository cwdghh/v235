title: Variational Learning is Effective for Large Deep Networks
openreview: cXBv07GKvk
abstract: We give extensive empirical evidence against the common belief that variational
  learning is ineffective for large neural networks. We show that an optimizer called
  Improved Variational Online Newton (IVON) consistently matches or outperforms Adam
  for training large networks such as GPT-2 and ResNets from scratch. IVON’s computational
  costs are nearly identical to Adam but its predictive uncertainty is better. We
  show several new use cases of IVON where we improve finetuning and model merging
  in Large Language Models, accurately predict generalization error, and faithfully
  estimate sensitivity to data. We find overwhelming evidence that variational learning
  is effective. Code is available at https://github.com/team-approx-bayes/ivon.
