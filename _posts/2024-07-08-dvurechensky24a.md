title: Barrier Algorithms for Constrained Non-Convex Optimization
openreview: tRESfzWFtf
abstract: In this paper we theoretically show that interior-point methods based on
  self-concordant barriers possess favorable global complexity beyond their standard
  application area of convex optimization. To do that we propose first- and second-order
  methods for non-convex optimization problems with general convex set constraints
  and linear constraints. Our methods attain a suitably defined class of approximate
  first- or second-order KKT points with the worst-case iteration complexity similar
  to unconstrained problems, namely $O(\varepsilon^{-2})$ (first-order) and $O(\varepsilon^{-3/2})$
  (second-order), respectively.
