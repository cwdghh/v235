title: Dynamic Facility Location in High Dimensional Euclidean Spaces
openreview: rucbIsWoEV
abstract: We study the facility location problem in the dynamic setting, where the
  goal is to efficiently process an intermixed sequence of point insertions and deletions
  while maintaining a high quality and stable solution. Although the problem has been
  studied in the context of general metrics and low-dimensional spaces, much remains
  unknown concerning dynamic facility location in high dimensional spaces. In this
  work, we present the first fully dynamic algorithm for facility location in high-dimensional
  spaces $\mathbb{R}^{d}$. For any $c \geq 1$, our algorithm achieves $O(c)$-approximation,
  supports point updates in $\tilde{O}(\mathrm{poly}(d)n^{1/c + o(1)})$ amortized
  time and incurs $O(1)$ amortized recourse. More generally, our result shows that
  despite the linear-time lower bound on the update time for general metrics, it is
  possible to achieve sub-linear update times for metric spaces that admit dynamic
  nearest neighbour oracles. Experiments on real datasets confirm that our algorithm
  achieves high-quality solutions with low running time, and incurs minimal recourse.
