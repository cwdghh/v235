title: Multi-Fidelity Residual Neural Processes for Scalable Surrogate Modeling
openreview: QRDfBIhrJq
abstract: 'Multi-fidelity surrogate modeling aims to learn an accurate surrogate at
  the highest fidelity level by combining data from multiple sources. Traditional
  methods relying on Gaussian processes can hardly scale to high-dimensional data.
  Deep learning approaches utilize neural network based encoders and decoders to improve
  scalability. These approaches share encoded representations across fidelities without
  including corresponding decoder parameters. This hinders inference performance,
  especially in out-of-distribution scenarios when the highest fidelity data has limited
  domain coverage. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-fidelity Residual
  Neural Processes (MFRNP), a novel multi-fidelity surrogate modeling framework. MFRNP
  explicitly models the residual between the aggregated output from lower fidelities
  and ground truth at the highest fidelity. The aggregation introduces decoders into
  the information sharing step and optimizes lower fidelity decoders to accurately
  capture both in-fidelity and cross-fidelity information. We show that MFRNP significantly
  outperforms state-of-the-art in learning partial differential equations and a real-world
  climate modeling task. Our code is published at: https://github.com/Rose-STL-Lab/MFRNP'
