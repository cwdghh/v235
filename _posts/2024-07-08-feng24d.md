title: 'DSD-DA: Distillation-based Source Debiasing for Domain Adaptive Object Detection'
openreview: zS8zUuAU8T
abstract: Though feature-alignment based Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) methods
  have achieved remarkable progress, they ignore the source bias issue, i.e., the
  detector tends to acquire more source-specific knowledge, impeding its generalization
  capabilities in the target domain. Furthermore, these methods face a more formidable
  challenge in achieving consistent classification and localization in the target
  domain compared to the source domain. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
  novel Distillation-based Source Debiasing (DSD) framework for DAOD, which can distill
  domain-agnostic knowledge from a pre-trained teacher model, improving the detectorâ€™s
  performance on both domains. In addition, we design a Target-Relevant Object Localization
  Network (TROLN), which can mine target-related localization information from source
  and target-style mixed data. Accordingly, we present a Domain-aware Consistency
  Enhancing (DCE) strategy, in which these information are formulated into a new localization
  representation to further refine classification scores in the testing stage, achieving
  a harmonization between classification and localization. Extensive experiments have
  been conducted to manifest the effectiveness of this method, which consistently
  improves the strong baseline by large margins, outperforming existing alignment-based
  works.
