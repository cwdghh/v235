title: Multi-View Clustering by Inter-cluster Connectivity Guided Reward
openreview: uEx2bSAJu8
abstract: Multi-view clustering has been widely explored for its effectiveness in
  harmonizing heterogeneity along with consistency in different views of data. Despite
  the significant progress made by recent works, the performance of most existing
  methods is heavily reliant on strong priori information regarding the true cluster
  number $\textit{K}$, which is rarely feasible in real-world scenarios. In this paper,
  we propose a novel graph-based multi-view clustering algorithm to infer unknown
  $\textit{K}$ through a graph consistency reward mechanism. To be specific, we evaluate
  the cluster indicator matrix during each iteration with respect to diverse $\textit{K}$.
  We formulate the inference process of unknown $\textit{K}$ as a parsimonious reinforcement
  learning paradigm, where the reward is measured by inter-cluster connectivity. As
  a result, our approach is capable of independently producing the final clustering
  result, free from the input of a predefined cluster number. Experimental results
  on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach
  in comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods.
