title: Projection-Free Variance Reduction Methods for Stochastic Constrained Multi-Level
  Compositional Optimization
openreview: 36jWuAmGRC
abstract: 'This paper investigates projection-free algorithms for stochastic constrained
  multi-level optimization. In this context, the objective function is a nested composition
  of several smooth functions, and the decision set is closed and convex. Existing
  projection-free algorithms for solving this problem suffer from two limitations:
  1) they solely focus on the gradient mapping criterion and fail to match the optimal
  sample complexities in unconstrained settings; 2) their analysis is exclusively
  applicable to non-convex functions, without considering convex and strongly convex
  objectives. To address these issues, we introduce novel projection-free variance
  reduction algorithms and analyze their complexities under different criteria. For
  gradient mapping, our complexities improve existing results and match the optimal
  rates for unconstrained problems. For the widely-used Frank-Wolfe gap criterion,
  we provide theoretical guarantees that align with those for single-level problems.
  Additionally, by using a stage-wise adaptation, we further obtain complexities for
  convex and strongly convex functions. Finally, numerical experiments on different
  tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.'
