title: Model-Based RL for Mean-Field Games is not Statistically Harder than Single-Agent
  RL
openreview: 4ye2I5OelI
abstract: We study the sample complexity of reinforcement learning (RL) in Mean-Field
  Games (MFGs) with model-based function approximation that requires strategic exploration
  to find a Nash Equilibrium policy. We introduce the Partial Model-Based Eluder Dimension
  (P-MBED), a more effective notion to characterize the model class complexity. Notably,
  P-MBED measures the complexity of the single-agent model class converted from the
  given mean-field model class, and potentially, can be exponentially lower than the
  MBED proposed by Huang et al. (2024). We contribute a model elimination algorithm
  featuring a novel exploration strategy and establish sample complexity results polynomial
  w.r.t. P-MBED. Crucially, our results reveal that, under the basic realizability
  and Lipschitz continuity assumptions, <em>learning Nash Equilibrium in MFGs is no
  more statistically challenging than solving a logarithmic number of single-agent
  RL problems</em>. We further extend our results to Multi-Type MFGs, generalizing
  from conventional MFGs and involving multiple types of agents. This extension implies
  statistical tractability of a broader class of Markov Games through the efficacy
  of mean-field approximation. Finally, inspired by our theoretical algorithm, we
  present a heuristic approach with improved computational efficiency and empirically
  demonstrate its effectiveness.
