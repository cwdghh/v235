title: 'PruNeRF: Segment-Centric Dataset Pruning via 3D Spatial Consistency'
openreview: mU7FfQT6VE
abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable performance in learning
  3D scenes. However, NeRF exhibits vulnerability when confronted with distractors
  in the training images â€“ unexpected objects are present only within specific views,
  such as moving entities like pedestrians or birds. Excluding distractors during
  dataset construction is a straightforward solution, but without prior knowledge
  of their types and quantities, it becomes prohibitively expensive. In this paper,
  we propose PruNeRF, a segment-centric dataset pruning framework via 3D spatial consistency,
  that effectively identifies and prunes the distractors. We first examine existing
  metrics for measuring pixel-wise distraction and introduce Influence Functions for
  more accurate measurements. Then, we assess 3D spatial consistency using a depth-based
  reprojection technique to obtain 3D-aware distraction. Furthermore, we incorporate
  segmentation for pixel-to-segment refinement, enabling more precise identification.
  Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PruNeRF consistently outperforms
  state-of-the-art methods in robustness against distractors.
