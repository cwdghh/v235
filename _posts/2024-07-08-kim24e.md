title: Achieving Lossless Gradient Sparsification via Mapping to Alternative Space
  in Federated Learning
openreview: vQmVmMN5ft
abstract: Handling the substantial communication burden in federated learning (FL)
  still remains a significant challenge. Although recent studies have attempted to
  compress the local gradients to address this issue, they typically perform compression
  only within the original parameter space, which may potentially limit the fundamental
  compression rate of the gradient. In this paper, instead of restricting our scope
  to a fixed traditional space, we consider an alternative space that provides an
  improved compressibility of the gradient. To this end, we utilize the structures
  of input activation and output gradient in designing our mapping function to a new
  space, which enables <em>lossless gradient sparsification</em>, i.e., mapping the
  gradient to our new space induces a greater number of <em>near-zero</em> elements
  without any loss of information. In light of this attribute, employing sparsification-based
  compressors in our new space allows for more aggressive compression with minimal
  information loss than the baselines. More surprisingly, our model even reaches higher
  accuracies than the full gradient uploading strategy in some cases, an extra benefit
  for utilizing the new space. We also theoretically confirm that our approach does
  not alter the existing, best known convergence rate of FL thanks to the orthogonal
  transformation properties of our mapping.
