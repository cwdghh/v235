title: 'HarmoDT: Harmony Multi-Task Decision Transformer for Offline Reinforcement
  Learning'
openreview: 2Asakozn3Z
abstract: The purpose of offline multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) is to develop
  a unified policy applicable to diverse tasks without the need for online environmental
  interaction. Recent advancements approach this through sequence modeling, leveraging
  the Transformer architectureâ€™s scalability and the benefits of parameter sharing
  to exploit task similarities. However, variations in task content and complexity
  pose significant challenges in policy formulation, necessitating judicious parameter
  sharing and management of conflicting gradients for optimal policy performance.
  In this work, we introduce the Harmony Multi-Task Decision Transformer (HarmoDT),
  a novel solution designed to identify an optimal harmony subspace of parameters
  for each task. We approach this as a bi-level optimization problem, employing a
  meta-learning framework that leverages gradient-based techniques. The upper level
  of this framework is dedicated to learning a task-specific mask that delineates
  the harmony subspace, while the inner level focuses on updating parameters to enhance
  the overall performance of the unified policy. Empirical evaluations on a series
  of benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of HarmoDT, verifying the effectiveness
  of our approach.
