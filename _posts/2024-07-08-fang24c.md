title: 'INViT: A Generalizable Routing Problem Solver with Invariant Nested View Transformer'
openreview: 1IZLOPxtfK
abstract: Recently, deep reinforcement learning has shown promising results for learning
  fast heuristics to solve routing problems. Meanwhile, most of the solvers suffer
  from generalizing to an unseen distribution or distributions with different scales.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel architecture, called Invariant Nested
  View Transformer (INViT), which is designed to enforce a nested design together
  with invariant views inside the encoders to promote the generalizability of the
  learned solver. It applies a modified policy gradient algorithm enhanced with data
  augmentations. We demonstrate that the proposed INViT achieves a dominant generalization
  performance on both TSP and CVRP problems with various distributions and different
  problem scales. Our source code and datasets are available in supplementary materials.
