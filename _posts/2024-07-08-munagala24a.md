title: Individual Fairness in Graph Decomposition
openreview: 8f8SI9X9ox
abstract: In this paper, we consider classic randomized low diameter decomposition
  procedures for planar graphs that obtain connected clusters that are cohesive in
  that close by pairs of nodes are assigned to the same cluster with high probability.
  We consider the additional aspect of <em>individual fairness</em> â€“ pairs of nodes
  at comparable distances should be separated with comparable probability. We show
  that classic decomposition procedures do not satisfy this property. We present novel
  algorithms that achieve various trade-offs between this property and additional
  desiderata of connectivity of the clusters and optimality in number of clusters.
  We show that our individual fairness bounds may be difficult to improve by tying
  the improvement to resolving a major open question in metric embeddings. We finally
  show the efficacy of our algorithms on real planar networks modeling Congressional
  redistricting.
