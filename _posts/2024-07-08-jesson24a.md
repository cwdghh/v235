title: 'ReLU to the Rescue: Improve Your On-Policy Actor-Critic with Positive Advantages'
openreview: 3umNqxjFad
abstract: 'This paper proposes a step toward approximate Bayesian inference in on-policy
  actor-critic deep reinforcement learning. It is implemented through three changes
  to the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm: (1) applying a ReLU
  function to advantage estimates, (2) spectral normalization of actor-critic weights,
  and (3) incorporating <em>dropout as a Bayesian approximation</em>. We prove under
  standard assumptions that restricting policy updates to positive advantages optimizes
  for value by maximizing a lower bound on the value function plus an additive term.
  We show that the additive term is bounded proportional to the Lipschitz constant
  of the value function, which offers theoretical grounding for spectral normalization
  of critic weights. Finally, our application of dropout corresponds to approximate
  Bayesian inference over both the actor and critic parameters, which enables <em>adaptive
  state-aware</em> exploration around the modes of the actor via Thompson sampling.
  We demonstrate significant improvements for median and interquartile mean metrics
  over A3C, PPO, SAC, and TD3 on the MuJoCo continuous control benchmark and improvement
  over PPO in the challenging ProcGen generalization benchmark.'
