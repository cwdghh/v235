title: Benign Overfitting in Two-Layer ReLU Convolutional Neural Networks for XOR
  Data
openreview: EhU0xBSP4l
abstract: Modern deep learning models are usually highly over-parameterized so that
  they can overfit the training data. Surprisingly, such overfitting neural networks
  can usually still achieve high prediction accuracy. To study this “benign overfitting”
  phenomenon, a line of recent works has theoretically studied the learning of linear
  models and two-layer neural networks. However, most of these analyses are still
  limited to the very simple learning problems where the Bayes-optimal classifier
  is linear. In this work, we investigate a class of XOR-type classification tasks
  with label-flipping noises. We show that, under a certain condition on the sample
  complexity and signal-to-noise ratio, an over-parameterized ReLU CNN trained by
  gradient descent can achieve near Bayes-optimal accuracy. Moreover, we also establish
  a matching lower bound result showing that when the previous condition is not satisfied,
  the prediction accuracy of the obtained CNN is an absolute constant away from the
  Bayes-optimal rate. Our result demonstrates that CNNs have a remarkable capacity
  to efficiently learn XOR problems, even in the presence of highly correlated features.
