title: High-Performance Temporal Reversible Spiking Neural Networks with $\mathcalO(L)$
  Training Memory and $\mathcalO(1)$ Inference Cost
openreview: s4h6nyjM9H
abstract: Multi-timestep simulation of brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)
  boost memory requirements during training and increase inference energy cost. Current
  training methods cannot simultaneously solve both training and inference dilemmas.
  This work proposes a novel Temporal Reversible architecture for SNNs (T-RevSNN)
  to jointly address the training and inference challenges by altering the forward
  propagation of SNNs. We turn off the temporal dynamics of most spiking neurons and
  design multi-level temporal reversible interactions at temporal turn-on spiking
  neurons, resulting in a $\mathcal{O}(L)$ training memory. Combined with the temporal
  reversible nature, we redesign the input encoding and network organization of SNNs
  to achieve $\mathcal{O}(1)$ inference energy cost. Then, we finely adjust the internal
  units and residual connections of the basic SNN block to ensure the effectiveness
  of sparse temporal information interaction. T-RevSNN achieves excellent accuracy
  on ImageNet, while the memory efficiency, training time acceleration and inference
  energy efficiency can be significantly improved by $8.6 \times$, $2.0 \times$ and
  $1.6 \times$, respectively. This work is expected to break the technical bottleneck
  of significantly increasing memory cost and training time for large-scale SNNs while
  maintaining both high performance and low inference energy cost.
