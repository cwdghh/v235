title: 'Finding NEM-U: Explaining unsupervised representation learning through neural
  network generated explanation masks'
openreview: Hzpt1Gws9g
abstract: Unsupervised representation learning has become an important ingredient
  of today’s deep learning systems. However, only a few methods exist that explain
  a learned vector embedding in the sense of providing information about which parts
  of an input are the most important for its representation. These methods generate
  the explanation for a given input after the model has been evaluated and tend to
  produce either inaccurate explanations or are slow, which limits their practical
  use. To address these limitations, we introduce the Neural Explanation Masks (NEM)
  framework, which turns a fixed representation model into a self-explaining model
  by augmenting it with a masking network. This network provides occlusion-based explanations
  in parallel to computing the representations during inference. We present an instance
  of this framework, the NEM-U (NEM using U-net structure) architecture, which leverages
  similarities between segmentation and occlusion-based masks. Our experiments show
  that NEM-U generates explanations faster and with lower complexity compared to the
  current state-of-the-art while maintaining high accuracy as measured by locality.
