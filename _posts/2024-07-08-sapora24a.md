title: 'EvIL: Evolution Strategies for Generalisable Imitation Learning'
openreview: 9DMMvMTDur
abstract: Often times in imitation learning (IL), the environment we collect expert
  demonstrations in and the environment we want to deploy our learned policy in arenâ€™t
  exactly the same (e.g. demonstrations collected in simulation but deployment in
  the real world). Compared to policy-centric approaches to IL like behavioural cloning,
  reward-centric approaches like <em>inverse reinforcement learning</em> (IRL) often
  better replicate expert behaviour in new environments. This transfer is usually
  performed by optimising the recovered reward under the dynamics of the target environment.
  However, <em>(a)</em> we find that modern deep IL algorithms frequently recover
  rewards which induce policies far weaker than the expert, <em>even in the same environment
  the demonstrations were collected in</em>. Furthermore, <em>(b)</em> these rewards
  are often quite poorly shaped, necessitating extensive environment interaction to
  optimise effectively. We provide simple and scalable fixes to both of these concerns.
  For <em>(a)</em>, we find that <em>reward model ensembles</em> combined with a slightly
  different training objective significantly improves re-training and transfer performance.
  For <em>(b)</em>, we propose a novel <em>evolution-strategies</em> based method
  (EvIL) to optimise for a reward-shaping term that speeds up re-training in the target
  environment, closing a gap left open by the classical theory of IRL. On a suite
  of continuous control tasks, we are able to re-train policies in target (and source)
  environments more interaction-efficiently than prior work.
