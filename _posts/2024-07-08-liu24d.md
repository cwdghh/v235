title: Graph Distillation with Eigenbasis Matching
openreview: DYN66IJCI9
abstract: The increasing amount of graph data places requirements on the efficient
  training of graph neural networks (GNNs). The emerging graph distillation (GD) tackles
  this challenge by distilling a small synthetic graph to replace the real large graph,
  ensuring GNNs trained on real and synthetic graphs exhibit comparable performance.
  However, existing methods rely on GNN-related information as supervision, including
  gradients, representations, and trajectories, which have two limitations. First,
  GNNs can affect the spectrum (<em>i.e</em>., eigenvalues) of the real graph, causing
  <em>spectrum bias</em> in the synthetic graph. Second, the variety of GNN architectures
  leads to the creation of different synthetic graphs, requiring <em>traversal</em>
  to obtain optimal performance. To tackle these issues, we propose Graph Distillation
  with Eigenbasis Matching (GDEM), which aligns the eigenbasis and node features of
  real and synthetic graphs. Meanwhile, it directly replicates the spectrum of the
  real graph and thus prevents the influence of GNNs. Moreover, we design a discrimination
  constraint to balance the effectiveness and generalization of GDEM. Theoretically,
  the synthetic graphs distilled by GDEM are restricted spectral approximations of
  the real graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GDEM outperforms state-of-the-art
  GD methods with powerful cross-architecture generalization ability and significant
  distillation efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/liuyang-tian/GDEM.
