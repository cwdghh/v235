title: Disparate Impact on Group Accuracy of Linearization for Private Inference
openreview: 6VZOONPn8S
abstract: Ensuring privacy-preserving inference on cryptographically secure data is
  a well-known computational challenge. To alleviate the bottleneck of costly cryptographic
  computations in non-linear activations, recent methods have suggested linearizing
  a targeted portion of these activations in neural networks. This technique results
  in significantly reduced runtimes with often negligible impacts on accuracy. In
  this paper, we demonstrate that such computational benefits may lead to increased
  fairness costs. Specifically, we find that reducing the number of ReLU activations
  disproportionately decreases the accuracy for minority groups compared to majority
  groups. To explain these observations, we provide a mathematical interpretation
  under restricted assumptions about the nature of the decision boundary, while also
  showing the prevalence of this problem across widely used datasets and architectures.
  Finally, we show how a simple procedure altering the finetuning step for linearized
  models can serve as an effective mitigation strategy.
