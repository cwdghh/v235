title: Model-Based Minimum Bayes Risk Decoding for Text Generation
openreview: qDUaH9xHVV
abstract: Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding has been shown to be a powerful alternative
  to beam search decoding in a variety of text generation tasks. MBR decoding selects
  a hypothesis from a pool of hypotheses that has the least expected risk under a
  probability model according to a given utility function. Since it is impractical
  to compute the expected risk exactly over all possible hypotheses, two approximations
  are commonly used in MBR. First, it integrates over a sampled set of hypotheses
  rather than over all possible hypotheses. Second, it estimates the probability of
  each hypothesis using a Monte Carlo estimator. While the first approximation is
  necessary to make it computationally feasible, the second is not essential since
  we typically have access to the model probability at inference time. We propose
  model-based MBR (MBMBR), a variant of MBR that uses the model probability itself
  as the estimate of the probability distribution instead of the Monte Carlo estimate.
  We show analytically and empirically that the model-based estimate is more promising
  than the Monte Carlo estimate in text generation tasks. Our experiments show that
  MBMBR outperforms MBR in several text generation tasks, both with encoder-decoder
  models and with language models.
