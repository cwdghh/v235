title: 'SPABA: A Single-Loop and Probabilistic Stochastic Bilevel Algorithm Achieving
  Optimal Sample Complexity'
openreview: 1YMjzz2g81
abstract: 'While stochastic bilevel optimization methods have been extensively studied
  for addressing large-scale nested optimization problems in machine learning, it
  remains an open question whether the optimal complexity bounds for solving bilevel
  optimization are the same as those in single-level optimization. Our main result
  resolves this question: SPABA, an adaptation of the PAGE method for nonconvex optimization
  in (Li et al., 2021) to the bilevel setting, can achieve optimal sample complexity
  in both the finite-sum and expectation settings. We show the optimality of SPABA
  by proving that there is no gap in complexity analysis between stochastic bilevel
  and single-level optimization when implementing PAGE. Notably, as indicated by the
  results of (Dagr√©ou et al., 2022), there might exist a gap in complexity analysis
  when implementing other stochastic gradient estimators, like SGD and SAGA. In addition
  to SPABA, we propose several other single-loop stochastic bilevel algorithms, that
  either match or improve the state-of-the-art sample complexity results, leveraging
  our convergence rate and complexity analysis. Numerical experiments demonstrate
  the superior practical performance of the proposed methods.'
