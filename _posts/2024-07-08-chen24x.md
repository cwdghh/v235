title: Efficient Pareto Manifold Learning with Low-Rank Structure
openreview: a2uFstsHPb
abstract: Multi-task learning, which optimizes performance across multiple tasks,
  is inherently a multi-objective optimization problem. Various algorithms are developed
  to provide discrete trade-off solutions on the Pareto front. Recently, continuous
  Pareto front approximations using a linear combination of base networks have emerged
  as a compelling strategy. However, it suffers from scalability issues when the number
  of tasks is large. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that integrates
  a main network with several low-rank matrices to efficiently learn the Pareto manifold.
  It significantly reduces the number of parameters and facilitates the extraction
  of shared features. We also introduce orthogonal regularization to further bolster
  performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach
  outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, especially on datasets with a large number
  of tasks.
