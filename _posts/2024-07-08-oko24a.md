title: 'SILVER: Single-loop variance reduction and application to federated learning'
openreview: pOgMluzEIH
abstract: 'Most variance reduction methods require multiple times of full gradient
  computation, which is time-consuming and hence a bottleneck in application to distributed
  optimization. We present a single-loop variance-reduced gradient estimator named
  SILVER (SIngle-Loop VariancE-Reduction) for the finite-sum non-convex optimization,
  which does not require multiple full gradients but nevertheless achieves the optimal
  gradient complexity. Notably, unlike existing methods, SILVER provably reaches second-order
  optimality, with exponential convergence in the Polyak-≈Åojasiewicz (PL) region,
  and achieves further speedup depending on the data heterogeneity. Owing to these
  advantages, SILVER serves as a new base method to design communication-efficient
  federated learning algorithms: we combine SILVER with local updates which gives
  the best communication rounds and number of communicated gradients across all range
  of Hessian heterogeneity, and, at the same time, guarantees second-order optimality
  and exponential convergence in the PL region.'
