title: 'Tilting the Odds at the Lottery: the Interplay of Overparameterisation and
  Curricula in Neural Networks'
openreview: 9L7BZiTtJR
abstract: A wide range of empirical and theoretical works have shown that overparameterisation
  can amplify the performance of neural networks. According to the lottery ticket
  hypothesis, overparameterised networks have an increased chance of containing a
  sub-network that is well-initialised to solve the task at hand. A more parsimonious
  approach, inspired by animal learning, consists in guiding the learner towards solving
  the task by curating the order of the examples, ie. providing a curriculum. However,
  this learning strategy seems to be hardly beneficial in deep learning applications.
  In this work, we propose a theoretical analysis that connects curriculum learning
  and overparameterisation. In particular, we investigate their interplay in the online
  learning setting for a 2-layer network in the XOR-like Gaussian Mixture problem.
  Our results show that a high degree of overparameterisation—while simplifying the
  problem—can limit the benefit from curricula, providing a theoretical account of
  the ineffectiveness of curricula in deep learning.
