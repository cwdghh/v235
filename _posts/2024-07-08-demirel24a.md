title: Prediction-powered Generalization of Causal Inferences
openreview: QKnWXX3aVm
abstract: Causal inferences from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) may not pertain
  to a <em>target</em> population where some effect modifiers have a different distribution.
  Prior work studies <em>generalizing</em> the results of a trial to a target population
  with no outcome but covariate data available. We show how the limited size of trials
  makes generalization a statistically infeasible task, as it requires estimating
  complex nuisance functions. We develop generalization algorithms that supplement
  the trial data with a prediction model learned from an additional <em>observational</em>
  study (OS), without making <em>any</em> assumptions on the OS. We theoretically
  and empirically show that our methods facilitate better generalization when the
  OS is "high-quality", and remain robust when it is not, and <em>e.g.</em>, have
  unmeasured confounding.
