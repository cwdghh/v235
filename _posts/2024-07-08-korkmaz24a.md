title: Understanding and Diagnosing Deep Reinforcement Learning
openreview: s9RKqT7jVM
abstract: Deep neural policies have recently been installed in a diverse range of
  settings, from biotechnology to automated financial systems. However, the utilization
  of deep neural networks to approximate the value function leads to concerns on the
  decision boundary stability, in particular, with regard to the sensitivity of policy
  decision making to indiscernible, non-robust features due to highly non-convex and
  complex deep neural manifolds. These concerns constitute an obstruction to understanding
  the reasoning made by deep neural policies, and their foundational limitations.
  Hence, it is crucial to develop techniques that aim to understand the sensitivities
  in the learnt representations of neural network policies. To achieve this we introduce
  a theoretically founded method that provides a systematic analysis of the unstable
  directions in the deep neural policy decision boundary across both time and space.
  Through experiments in the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), we demonstrate the
  effectiveness of our technique for identifying correlated directions of instability,
  and for measuring how sample shifts remold the set of sensitive directions in the
  neural policy landscape. Most importantly, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art
  robust training techniques yield learning of disjoint unstable directions, with
  dramatically larger oscillations over time, when compared to standard training.
  We believe our results reveal the fundamental properties of the decision process
  made by reinforcement learning policies, and can help in constructing reliable and
  robust deep neural policies.
