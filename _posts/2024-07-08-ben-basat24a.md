title: Accelerating Federated Learning with Quick Distributed Mean Estimation
openreview: gWEwIlZrbQ
abstract: Distributed Mean Estimation (DME), in which $n$ clients communicate vectors
  to a parameter server that estimates their average, is a fundamental building block
  in communication-efficient federated learning. In this paper, we improve on previous
  DME techniques that achieve the optimal $O(1/n)$ Normalized Mean Squared Error (NMSE)
  guarantee by asymptotically improving the complexity for either encoding or decoding
  (or both). To achieve this, we formalize the problem in a novel way that allows
  us to use off-the-shelf mathematical solvers to design the quantization. Using various
  datasets and training tasks, we demonstrate how QUIC-FL achieves state of the art
  accuracy with faster encoding and decoding times compared to other DME methods.
