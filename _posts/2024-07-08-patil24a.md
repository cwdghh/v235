title: Optimal Ridge Regularization for Out-of-Distribution Prediction
openreview: bvPYroQgc3
abstract: We study the behavior of optimal ridge regularization and optimal ridge
  risk for out-of-distribution prediction, where the test distribution deviates arbitrarily
  from the train distribution. We establish general conditions that determine the
  sign of the optimal regularization level under covariate and regression shifts.
  These conditions capture the alignment between the covariance and signal structures
  in the train and test data and reveal stark differences compared to the in-distribution
  setting. For example, a negative regularization level can be optimal under covariate
  shift or regression shift, even when the training features are isotropic or the
  design is underparameterized. Furthermore, we prove that the optimally tuned risk
  is monotonic in the data aspect ratio, even in the out-of-distribution setting and
  when optimizing over negative regularization levels. In general, our results do
  not make any modeling assumptions for the train or the test distributions, except
  for moment bounds, and allow for arbitrary shifts and the widest possible range
  of (negative) regularization levels.
