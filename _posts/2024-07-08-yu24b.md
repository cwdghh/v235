title: Towards Resource-friendly, Extensible and Stable Incomplete Multi-view Clustering
openreview: O45u81aby2
abstract: 'Incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) methods typically encounter three
  drawbacks: (1) intense time and/or space overheads; (2) intractable hyper-parameters;
  (3) non-zero variance results. With these concerns in mind, we give a simple yet
  effective IMVC scheme, termed as ToRES. Concretely, instead of self-expression affinity,
  we manage to construct prototype-sample affinity for incomplete data so as to decrease
  the memory requirements. To eliminate hyper-parameters, besides mining complementary
  features among views by view-wise prototypes, we also attempt to devise cross-view
  prototypes to capture consensus features for jointly forming high-quality clustering
  representation. To avoid the variance, we successfully unify representation learning
  and clustering operation, and directly optimize the discrete cluster indicators
  from incomplete data. Then, for the resulting objective function, we provide two
  equivalent solutions from perspectives of feasible region partitioning and objective
  transformation. Many results suggest that ToRES exhibits advantages against 20 SOTA
  algorithms, even in scenarios with a higher ratio of incomplete data.'
