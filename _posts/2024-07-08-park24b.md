title: 'The Max-Min Formulation of Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning: From Theory
  to a Model-Free Algorithm'
openreview: cY9g0bwiZx
abstract: In this paper, we consider multi-objective reinforcement learning, which
  arises in many real-world problems with multiple optimization goals. We approach
  the problem with a max-min framework focusing on fairness among the multiple goals
  and develop a relevant theory and a practical model-free algorithm under the max-min
  framework. The developed theory provides a theoretical advance in multi-objective
  reinforcement learning, and the proposed algorithm demonstrates a notable performance
  improvement over existing baseline methods.
