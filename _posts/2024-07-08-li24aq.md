title: 'Cascade-CLIP: Cascaded Vision-Language Embeddings Alignment for Zero-Shot
  Semantic Segmentation'
openreview: WUdq1WFUPr
abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, have been successfully applied
  to zero-shot semantic segmentation. Existing CLIP-based approaches primarily utilize
  visual features from the last layer to align with text embeddings, while they neglect
  the crucial information in intermediate layers that contain rich object details.
  However, we find that directly aggregating the multi-level visual features weakens
  the zero-shot ability for novel classes. The large differences between the visual
  features from different layers make these features hard to align well with the text
  embeddings. We resolve this problem by introducing a series of independent decoders
  to align the multi-level visual features with the text embeddings in a cascaded
  way, forming a novel but simple framework named Cascade-CLIP. Our Cascade-CLIP is
  flexible and can be easily applied to existing zero-shot semantic segmentation methods.
  Experimental results show that our simple Cascade-CLIP achieves superior zero-shot
  performance on segmentation benchmarks, like COCO-Stuff, Pascal-VOC, and Pascal-Context.
