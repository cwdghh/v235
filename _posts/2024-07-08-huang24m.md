title: 'AttNS: Attention-Inspired Numerical Solving For Limited Data Scenarios'
openreview: 7RHFdkAkVY
abstract: We propose the attention-inspired numerical solver (AttNS), a concise method
  that helps the generalization and robustness issues faced by the AI-Hybrid numerical
  solver in solving differential equations due to limited data. AttNS is inspired
  by the effectiveness of attention modules in Residual Neural Networks (ResNet) in
  enhancing model generalization and robustness for conventional deep learning tasks.
  Drawing from the dynamical system perspective of ResNet, We seamlessly incorporate
  attention mechanisms into the design of numerical methods tailored for the characteristics
  of solving differential equations. Our results on benchmarks, ranging from high-dimensional
  problems to chaotic systems, showcase AttNS consistently enhancing various numerical
  solvers without any intricate model crafting. Finally, we analyze AttNS experimentally
  and theoretically, demonstrating its ability to achieve strong generalization and
  robustness while ensuring the convergence of the solver. This includes requiring
  less data compared to other advanced methods to achieve comparable generalization
  errors and better prevention of numerical explosion issues when solving differential
  equations.
