title: Allocation Requires Prediction Only if Inequality Is Low
openreview: WUicA0hOF9
abstract: 'Algorithmic predictions are emerging as a promising solution concept for
  efficiently allocating societal resources. Fueling their use is an underlying assumption
  that such systems are necessary to identify individuals for interventions. We propose
  a principled framework for assessing this assumption: Using a simple mathematical
  model, we evaluate the efficacy of prediction-based allocations in settings where
  individuals belong to larger units such as hospitals, neighborhoods, or schools.
  We find that prediction-based allocations outperform baseline methods using aggregate
  unit-level statistics only when between-unit inequality is low and the intervention
  budget is high. Our results hold for a wide range of settings for the price of prediction,
  treatment effect heterogeneity, and unit-level statisticsâ€™ learnability. Combined,
  we highlight the potential limits to improving the efficacy of interventions through
  prediction.'
