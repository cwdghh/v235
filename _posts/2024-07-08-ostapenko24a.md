title: Towards Modular LLMs by Building and Reusing a Library of LoRAs
openreview: 0ZFWfeVsaD
abstract: Given the increasing number of parameter-efficient adapters of large language
  models (LLMs), how can we reuse them to improve LLM performance on new tasks? We
  study how to best build a <em>library</em> of adapters given multi-task data and
  devise techniques for both <em>zero-shot</em> and <em>supervised</em> task generalization
  through <em>routing</em> in such library. We benchmark existing approaches to build
  this library and introduce model-based clustering, $\texttt{MBC}$, a method that
  groups tasks based on the similarity of their adapter parameters, indirectly optimizing
  for transfer across the multi-task dataset. In order to reuse the library, we present
  a novel zero-shot routing mechanism, $\texttt{Arrow}$, which enables dynamic selection
  of the most relevant adapters for new inputs without the need for retraining. We
  experiment with several LLMs, such as Phi-2 and Mistral, on a wide array of held-out
  tasks, verifying that MBC-based adapters and Arrow routing lead to superior generalization
  to new tasks. Thus, we make steps towards creating modular, adaptable LLMs that
  can match or outperform traditional joint training.
