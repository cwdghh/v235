title: 'Nonsmooth Implicit Differentiation: Deterministic and Stochastic Convergence
  Rates'
openreview: SlRcJvf1yd
abstract: 'We study the problem of efficiently computing the derivative of the fixed-point
  of a parametric nondifferentiable contraction map. This problem has wide applications
  in machine learning, including hyperparameter optimization, meta-learning and data
  poisoning attacks. We analyze two popular approaches: iterative differentiation
  (ITD) and approximate implicit differentiation (AID). A key challenge behind the
  nonsmooth setting is that the chain rule does not hold anymore. We build upon the
  work by Bolte et al. (2022), who prove linear convergence of nonsmooth ITD under
  a piecewise Lipschitz smooth assumption. In the deterministic case, we provide a
  linear rate for AID and an improved linear rate for ITD which closely match the
  ones for the smooth setting. We further introduce NSID, a new stochastic method
  to compute the implicit derivative when the contraction map is defined as the composition
  of an outer map and an inner map which is accessible only through a stochastic unbiased
  estimator. We establish rates for the convergence of NSID, encompassing the best
  available rates in the smooth setting. We also present illustrative experiments
  confirming our analysis.'
