title: 'Mastering Text-to-Image Diffusion: Recaptioning, Planning, and Generating
  with Multimodal LLMs'
openreview: DgLFkAPwuZ
abstract: Diffusion models have exhibit exceptional performance in text-to-image generation
  and editing. However, existing methods often face challenges when handling complex
  text prompts that involve multiple objects with multiple attributes and relationships.
  In this paper, we propose a brand new training-free text-to-image generation/editing
  framework, namely Recaption, Plan and Generate (RPG), harnessing the powerful chain-of-thought
  reasoning ability of multimodal LLMs to enhance the compositionality of text-to-image
  diffusion models. Our approach employs the MLLM as a global planner to decompose
  the process of generating complex images into multiple simpler generation tasks
  within subregions. We propose complementary regional diffusion to enable region-wise
  compositional generation. Furthermore, we integrate text-guided image generation
  and editing within the proposed RPG in a closed-loop fashion, thereby enhancing
  generalization ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate our RPG outperforms state-of-the-art
  text-to-image models, including DALL-E 3 and SDXL, particularly in multi-category
  object composition and text-image semantic alignment. Notably, our RPG framework
  exhibits wide compatibility with various MLLM architectures and diffusion backbones.
