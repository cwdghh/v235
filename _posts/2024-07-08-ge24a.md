title: Masked Face Recognition with Generative-to-Discriminative Representations
openreview: tya725xlZ3
abstract: Masked face recognition is important for social good but challenged by diverse
  occlusions that cause insufficient or inaccurate representations. In this work,
  we propose a unified deep network to learn generative-to-discriminative representations
  for facilitating masked face recognition. To this end, we split the network into
  three modules and learn them on synthetic masked faces in a greedy module-wise pretraining
  manner. First, we leverage a generative encoder pretrained for face inpainting and
  finetune it to represent masked faces into category-aware descriptors. Attribute
  to the generative encoderâ€™s ability in recovering context information, the resulting
  descriptors can provide occlusion-robust representations for masked faces, mitigating
  the effect of diverse masks. Then, we incorporate a multi-layer convolutional network
  as a discriminative reformer and learn it to convert the category-aware descriptors
  into identity-aware vectors, where the learning is effectively supervised by distilling
  relation knowledge from off-the-shelf face recognition model. In this way, the discriminative
  reformer together with the generative encoder serves as the pretrained backbone,
  providing general and discriminative representations towards masked faces. Finally,
  we cascade one fully-connected layer following by one softmax layer into a feature
  classifier and finetune it to identify the reformed identity-aware vectors. Extensive
  experiments on synthetic and realistic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
  our approach in recognizing masked faces.
