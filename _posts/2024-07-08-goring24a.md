title: Out-of-Domain Generalization in Dynamical Systems Reconstruction
openreview: xTYIAD2NND
abstract: In science we are interested in finding the governing equations, the dynamical
  rules, underlying empirical phenomena. While traditionally scientific models are
  derived through cycles of human insight and experimentation, recently deep learning
  (DL) techniques have been advanced to reconstruct dynamical systems (DS) directly
  from time series data. State-of-the-art dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) methods
  show promise in capturing invariant and long-term properties of observed DS, but
  their ability to generalize to unobserved domains remains an open challenge. Yet,
  this is a crucial property we would expect from any viable scientific theory. In
  this work, we provide a formal framework that addresses generalization in DSR. We
  explain why and how out-of-domain (OOD) generalization (OODG) in DSR profoundly
  differs from OODG considered elsewhere in machine learning. We introduce mathematical
  notions based on topological concepts and ergodic theory to formalize the idea of
  learnability of a DSR model. We formally prove that black-box DL techniques, without
  adequate structural priors, generally will not be able to learn a generalizing DSR
  model. We also show this empirically, considering major classes of DSR algorithms
  proposed so far, and illustrate where and why they fail to generalize across the
  whole phase space. Our study provides the first comprehensive mathematical treatment
  of OODG in DSR, and gives a deeper conceptual understanding of where the fundamental
  problems in OODG lie and how they could possibly be addressed in practice.
