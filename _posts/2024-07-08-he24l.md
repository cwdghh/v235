title: 'Be Your Own Neighborhood: Detecting Adversarial Examples by the Neighborhood
  Relations Built on Self-Supervised Learning'
openreview: S4LqI6CcJ3
abstract: 'Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to Adversarial Examples (AEs),
  hindering their use in safety-critical systems. In this paper, we present <b>BEYOND</b>,
  an innovative AE detection framework designed for reliable predictions. BEYOND identifies
  AEs by distinguishing the AEâ€™s abnormal relation with its augmented versions, i.e.
  neighbors, from two prospects: representation similarity and label consistency.
  An off-the-shelf Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) model is used to extract the representation
  and predict the label for its highly informative representation capacity compared
  to supervised learning models. We found clean samples maintain a high degree of
  representation similarity and label consistency relative to their neighbors, in
  contrast to AEs which exhibit significant discrepancies. We explain this observation
  and show that leveraging this discrepancy BEYOND can accurately detect AEs. Additionally,
  we develop a rigorous justification for the effectiveness of BEYOND. Furthermore,
  as a plug-and-play model, BEYOND can easily cooperate with the Adversarial Trained
  Classifier (ATC), achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) robustness accuracy. Experimental
  results show that BEYOND outperforms baselines by a large margin, especially under
  adaptive attacks. Empowered by the robust relationship built on SSL, we found that
  BEYOND outperforms baselines in terms of both detection ability and speed. Project
