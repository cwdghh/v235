title: 'ILILT: Implicit Learning of Inverse Lithography Technologies'
openreview: b0lxGL2n3d
abstract: 'Lithography, transferring chip design masks to the silicon wafer, is the
  most important phase in modern semiconductor manufacturing flow. Due to the limitations
  of lithography systems, Extensive design optimizations are required to tackle the
  design and silicon mismatch. Inverse lithography technology (ILT) is one of the
  promising solutions to perform pre-fabrication optimization, termed mask optimization.
  Because of mask optimization problemsâ€™ constrained non-convexity, numerical ILT
  solvers rely heavily on good initialization to avoid getting stuck on sub-optimal
  solutions. Machine learning (ML) techniques are hence proposed to generate mask
  initialization for ILT solvers with one-shot inference, targeting faster and better
  convergence during ILT. This paper addresses the question of whether ML models can
  directly generate high-quality optimized masks without engaging ILT solvers in the
  loop. We propose an implicit learning ILT framework: ILILT, which leverages the
  implicit layer learning method and lithography-conditioned inputs to ground the
  model. Trained to understand the ILT optimization procedure, ILILT can outperform
  the state-of-the-art machine learning solutions, significantly improving efficiency
  and quality.'
