title: Learning from Integral Losses in Physics Informed Neural Networks
openreview: itDhUBY2xf
abstract: 'This work proposes a solution for the problem of training physics-informed
  networks under partial integro-differential equations. These equations require an
  infinite or a large number of neural evaluations to construct a single residual
  for training. As a result, accurate evaluation may be impractical, and we show that
  naive approximations at replacing these integrals with unbiased estimates lead to
  biased loss functions and solutions. To overcome this bias, we investigate three
  types of potential solutions: the deterministic sampling approaches, the double-sampling
  trick, and the delayed target method. We consider three classes of PDEs for benchmarking;
  one defining Poisson problems with singular charges and weak solutions of up to
  10 dimensions, another involving weak solutions on electro-magnetic fields and a
  Maxwell equation, and a third one defining a Smoluchowski coagulation problem. Our
  numerical results confirm the existence of the aforementioned bias in practice and
  also show that our proposed delayed target approach can lead to accurate solutions
  with comparable quality to ones estimated with a large sample size integral. Our
  implementation is open-source and available at https://github.com/ehsansaleh/btspinn.'
