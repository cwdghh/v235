title: Improving Neural Logic Machines via Failure Reflection
openreview: JObct1zyTb
abstract: Reasoning is a fundamental ability towards artificial general intelligence
  (AGI). Fueled by the success of deep learning, the neural logic machines models
  (NLMs) have introduced novel neural-symbolic structures and demonstrate great performance
  and generalization on reasoning and decision-making tasks. However, the original
  training approaches of the NLMs are still far from perfect, the models would repeat
  similar mistakes during the training process which leads to sub-optimal performance.
  To mitigate this issue, we present a novel framework named Failure Reflection Guided
  Regularizer (FRGR). FRGR first dynamically identifies and summarizes the root cause
  if the model repeats similar mistakes during training. Then it penalizes the model
  if it makes similar mistakes in future training iterations. In this way, the model
  is expected to avoid repeating errors of similar root causes and converge faster
  to a better-performed optimum. Experimental results on multiple relational reasoning
  and decision-making tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of FRGR in improving performance,
  generalization, training efficiency, and data efficiency.
