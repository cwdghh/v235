title: 'AdsorbDiff: Adsorbate Placement via Conditional Denoising Diffusion'
openreview: ZMgpE58PMj
abstract: Determining the optimal configuration of adsorbates on a slab (adslab) is
  pivotal in the exploration of novel catalysts across diverse applications. Traditionally,
  the quest for the lowest energy adslab configuration involves placing the adsorbate
  onto the slab followed by an optimization process. Prior methodologies have relied
  on heuristics, problem-specific intuitions, or brute-force approaches to guide adsorbate
  placement. In this work, we propose a novel framework for adsorbate placement using
  denoising diffusion. The model is designed to predict the optimal adsorbate site
  and orientation corresponding to the lowest energy configuration. Further, we have
  an end-to-end evaluation framework where diffusion-predicted adslab configuration
  is optimized with a pretrained machine learning force field and finally evaluated
  with Density Functional Theory (DFT). Our findings demonstrate an acceleration of
  up to 5x or 3.5x improvement in accuracy compared to the previous best approach.
  Given the novelty of this framework and application, we provide insights into the
  impact of pretraining, model architectures, and conduct extensive experiments to
  underscore the significance of this approach.
