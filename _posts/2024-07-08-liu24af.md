title: 'Stereo Risk: A Continuous Modeling Approach to Stereo Matching'
openreview: Mfk6ZbD6eY
abstract: We introduce Stereo Risk, a new deep-learning approach to solve the classical
  stereo-matching problem in computer vision. As it is well-known that stereo matching
  boils down to a per-pixel disparity estimation problem, the popular state-of-the-art
  stereo-matching approaches widely rely on regressing the scene disparity values,
  yet via discretization of scene disparity values. Such discretization often fails
  to capture the nuanced, continuous nature of scene depth. Stereo Risk departs from
  the conventional discretization approach by formulating the scene disparity as an
  optimal solution to a continuous risk minimization problem, hence the name "stereo
  risk". We demonstrate that $L^1$ minimization of the proposed continuous risk function
  enhances stereo-matching performance for deep networks, particularly for disparities
  with multi-modal probability distributions. Furthermore, to enable the end-to-end
  network training of the non-differentiable $L^1$ risk optimization, we exploited
  the implicit function theorem, ensuring a fully differentiable network. A comprehensive
  analysis demonstrates our methodâ€™s theoretical soundness and superior performance
  over the state-of-the-art methods across various benchmark datasets, including KITTI
  2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, SceneFlow, and Middlebury 2014.
