title: Stochastic Interpolants with Data-Dependent Couplings
openreview: FFILRGD0jG
abstract: Generative models inspired by dynamical transport of measure – such as flows
  and diffusions – construct a continuous-time map between two probability densities.
  Conventionally, one of these is the target density, only accessible through samples,
  while the other is taken as a simple base density that is data-agnostic. In this
  work, using the framework of stochastic interpolants, we formalize how to <em>couple</em>
  the base and the target densities, whereby samples from the base are computed conditionally
  given samples from the target in a way that is different from (but does not preclude)
  incorporating information about class labels or continuous embeddings. This enables
  us to construct dynamical transport maps that serve as conditional generative models.
  We show that these transport maps can be learned by solving a simple square loss
  regression problem analogous to the standard independent setting. We demonstrate
  the usefulness of constructing dependent couplings in practice through experiments
  in super-resolution and in-painting. The code is available at https://github.com/interpolants/couplings.
