title: 'QORA: Zero-Shot Transfer via Interpretable Object-Relational Model Learning'
openreview: pAzDdYzEva
abstract: Although neural networks have demonstrated significant success in various
  reinforcement-learning tasks, even the highest-performing deep models often fail
  to generalize. As an alternative, object-oriented approaches offer a promising path
  towards better efficiency and generalization; however, they typically address narrow
  problem classes and require extensive domain knowledge. To overcome these limitations,
  we introduce <em>QORA</em>, an algorithm that constructs models expressive enough
  to solve a variety of domains, including those with stochastic transition functions,
  directly from a domain-agnostic object-based state representation. We also provide
  a novel benchmark suite to evaluate learners’ generalization capabilities. In our
  test domains, QORA achieves 100% predictive accuracy using almost four orders of
  magnitude fewer observations than a neural-network baseline, demonstrates zero-shot
  transfer to modified environments, and adapts rapidly when applied to tasks involving
  previously unseen object interactions. Finally, we give examples of QORA’s learned
  rules, showing them to be easily interpretable.
