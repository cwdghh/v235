title: 'BWS: Best Window Selection Based on Sample Scores for Data Pruning across
  Broad Ranges'
openreview: oWYzIodyC4
abstract: Data subset selection aims to find a smaller yet informative subset of a
  large dataset that can approximate the full-dataset training, addressing challenges
  associated with training neural networks on large-scale datasets. However, existing
  methods tend to specialize in either high or low selection ratio regimes, lacking
  a universal approach that consistently achieves competitive performance across a
  broad range of selection ratios. We introduce a universal and efficient data subset
  selection method, Best Window Selection (BWS), by proposing a method to choose the
  best window subset from samples ordered based on their difficulty scores. This approach
  offers flexibility by allowing the choice of window intervals that span from easy
  to difficult samples. Furthermore, we provide an efficient mechanism for selecting
  the best window subset by evaluating its quality using kernel ridge regression.
  Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of BWS compared to
  other baselines across a broad range of selection ratios over datasets, including
  CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet, and the scenarios involving training from random initialization
  or fine-tuning of pre-trained models.
