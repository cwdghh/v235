title: Partial Optimality in the Linear Ordering Problem
openreview: vYYIuJDTHq
abstract: The linear ordering problem consists in finding a linear order $<$ on a
  finite set $A$ so as to minimize the sum of costs associated with pairs of elements
  $a, b$ for which $a < b$. The problem is NP-hard and APX-hard. We introduce algorithms
  for solving the problem <em>partially</em> by deciding efficiently for some pairs
  $(a,b)$ whether $a < b$ is in an optimal solution. To do so, we construct maps from
  the feasible set of orders to itself and establish efficiently testable conditions
  on the cost function of the problem for which these maps are improving. We examine
  the effectiveness and efficiency of these conditions and algorithms empirically,
  on two data sets.
