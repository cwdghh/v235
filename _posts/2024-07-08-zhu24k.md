title: 'Online Learning in Betting Markets: Profit versus Prediction'
openreview: Mz1lcJPymz
abstract: We examine two types of binary betting markets, whose primary goal is for
  profit (such as sports gambling) or to gain information (such as prediction markets).
  We articulate the interplay between belief and price-setting to analyse both types
  of markets, and show that the goals of maximising bookmaker profit and eliciting
  information are fundamentally incompatible. A key insight is that profit hinges
  on the deviation between (the distribution of) bettor and true beliefs, and that
  heavier tails in bettor belief distribution implies higher profit. Our algorithmic
  contribution is to introduce online learning methods for price-setting. Traditionally
  bookmakers update their prices rather infrequently, we present two algorithms that
  guide price updates upon seeing each bet, assuming very little of bettor belief
  distributions. The online pricing algorithm achieves stochastic regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$
  against the worst local maximum, or $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log T})$ with high probability
  against the global maximum under fair odds. More broadly, the inherent tradeoff
  between profit and information-seeking in binary betting may inspire new understandings
  of large-scale multi-agent behaviour.
