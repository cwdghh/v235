title: A Doubly Recursive Stochastic Compositional Gradient Descent Method for Federated
  Multi-Level Compositional Optimization
openreview: GentO2E4ID
abstract: Federated compositional optimization has been actively studied in the past
  few years. However, existing methods mainly focus on the two-level compositional
  optimization problem, which cannot be directly applied to the multi-level counterparts.
  Moreover, the convergence rate of existing federated two-level compositional optimization
  learning algorithms fails to achieve linear speedup with respect to the number of
  workers under heterogeneous settings. After identifying the reason for this failure,
  we developed a novel federated stochastic multi-level compositional optimization
  algorithm by introducing a novel Jacobian-vector product estimator. This innovation
  mitigates both the heterogeneity issue and the communication efficiency issue simultaneously.
  We then theoretically proved that our algorithm can achieve the level-independent
  and linear speedup convergence rate for nonconvex problems. To our knowledge, this
  is the first time that a federated learning algorithm can achieve such a favorable
  convergence rate for multi-level compositional problems. Moreover, experimental
  results confirm the efficacy of our algorithm.
