title: 'Contextualized Policy Recovery: Modeling and Interpreting Medical Decisions
  with Adaptive Imitation Learning'
openreview: YEQM0asWCH
abstract: 'Interpretable policy learning seeks to estimate intelligible decision policies
  from observed actions; however, existing models force a tradeoff between accuracy
  and interpretability, limiting data-driven interpretations of human decision-making
  processes. Fundamentally, existing approaches are burdened by this tradeoff because
  they represent the underlying decision process as a universal policy, when in fact
  human decisions are dynamic and can change drastically under different contexts.
  Thus, we develop Contextualized Policy Recovery (CPR), which re-frames the problem
  of modeling complex decision processes as a multi-task learning problem, where each
  context poses a unique task and complex decision policies can be constructed piece-wise
  from many simple context-specific policies. CPR models each context-specific policy
  as a linear map, and generates new policy models <em>on-demand</em> as contexts
  are updated with new observations. We provide two flavors of the CPR framework:
  one focusing on exact local interpretability, and one retaining full global interpretability.
  We assess CPR through studies on simulated and real data, achieving state-of-the-art
  performance on predicting antibiotic prescription in intensive care units ($+22$%
  AUROC vs. previous SOTA) and predicting MRI prescription for Alzheimerâ€™s patients
  ($+7.7$% AUROC vs. previous SOTA). With this improvement, CPR closes the accuracy
  gap between interpretable and black-box methods, allowing high-resolution exploration
  and analysis of context-specific decision models.'
