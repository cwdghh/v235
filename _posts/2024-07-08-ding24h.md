title: 'Quality Diversity through Human Feedback: Towards Open-Ended Diversity-Driven
  Optimization'
openreview: 9zlZuAAb08
abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown potential in
  qualitative tasks where easily defined performance measures are lacking. However,
  there are drawbacks when RLHF is commonly used to optimize for average human preferences,
  especially in generative tasks that demand diverse model responses. Meanwhile, Quality
  Diversity (QD) algorithms excel at identifying diverse and high-quality solutions
  but often rely on manually crafted diversity metrics. This paper introduces Quality
  Diversity through Human Feedback (QDHF), a novel approach that progressively infers
  diversity metrics from human judgments of similarity among solutions, thereby enhancing
  the applicability and effectiveness of QD algorithms in complex and open-ended domains.
  Empirical studies show that QDHF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
  in automatic diversity discovery and matches the efficacy of QD with manually crafted
  diversity metrics on standard benchmarks in robotics and reinforcement learning.
  Notably, in open-ended generative tasks, QDHF substantially enhances the diversity
  of text-to-image generation from a diffusion model and is more favorably received
  in user studies. We conclude by analyzing QDHFâ€™s scalability, robustness, and quality
  of derived diversity metrics, emphasizing its strength in open-ended optimization
  tasks. Code and tutorials are available at https://liding.info/qdhf.
