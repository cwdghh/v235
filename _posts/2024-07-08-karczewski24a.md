title: On the Generalization of Equivariant Graph Neural Networks
openreview: Yqj3DzIC79
abstract: "$E(n)$-Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) are among the most widely
  used and successful models for representation learning on geometric graphs (e.g.,
  3D molecules). However, while the expressivity of EGNNs has been explored in terms
  of geometric variants of the Weisfeiler-Leman isomorphism test, characterizing their
  generalization capability remains open. In this work, we establish the first generalization
  bound for EGNNs. Our bound depicts a dependence on the weighted sum of logarithms
  of the spectral norms of the weight matrices (EGNN parameters). In addition, our
  main result reveals interesting novel insights: $i$) the spectral norms of the initial
  layers may impact generalization more than the final ones; $ii$) $\\varepsilon$-normalization
  is beneficial to generalization â€” confirming prior empirical evidence. We leverage
  these insights to introduce a spectral norm regularizer tailored to EGNNs. Experiments
  on real-world datasets substantiate our analysis, demonstrating a high correlation
  between theoretical and empirical generalization gaps and the effectiveness of the
  proposed regularization scheme."
