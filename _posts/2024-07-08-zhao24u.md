title: 'LangCell: Language-Cell Pre-training for Cell Identity Understanding'
openreview: GcZjpKA37R
abstract: Cell identity encompasses various semantic aspects of a cell, including
  cell type, pathway information, disease information, and more, which are essential
  for biologists to gain insights into its biological characteristics. Understanding
  cell identity from the transcriptomic data, such as annotating cell types, has become
  an important task in bioinformatics. As these semantic aspects are determined by
  human experts, it is impossible for AI models to effectively carry out cell identity
  understanding tasks without the supervision signals provided by single-cell and
  label pairs. The single-cell pre-trained language models (PLMs) currently used for
  this task are trained only on a single modality, transcriptomics data, lack an understanding
  of cell identity knowledge. As a result, they have to be fine-tuned for downstream
  tasks and struggle when lacking labeled data with the desired semantic labels. To
  address this issue, we propose an innovative solution by constructing a unified
  representation of single-cell data and natural language during the pre-training
  phase, allowing the model to directly incorporate insights related to cell identity.
  More specifically, we introduce <b>LangCell</b>, the first <b>Lang</b>uage-<b>Cell</b>
  pre-training framework. LangCell utilizes texts enriched with cell identity information
  to gain a profound comprehension of cross-modal knowledge. Results from experiments
  conducted on different benchmarks show that LangCell is the only single-cell PLM
  that can work effectively in zero-shot cell identity understanding scenarios, and
  also significantly outperforms existing models in few-shot and fine-tuning cell
  identity understanding scenarios.
