title: Can Machines Learn the True Probabilities?
openreview: TzqmqZS0nj
abstract: When there exists uncertainty, AI machines are designed to make decisions
  so as to reach the best expected outcomes. Expectations are based on true facts
  about the objective environment the machines interact with, and those facts can
  be encoded into AI models in the form of true objective probability functions. Accordingly,
  AI models involve probabilistic machine learning in which the probabilities should
  be objectively interpreted. We prove under some basic assumptions when machines
  can learn the true objective probabilities, if any, and when machines cannot learn
  them.
