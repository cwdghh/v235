title: Bringing Motion Taxonomies to Continuous Domains via GPLVM on Hyperbolic manifolds
openreview: ndVXXmxSC5
abstract: Human motion taxonomies serve as high-level hierarchical abstractions that
  classify how humans move and interact with their environment. They have proven useful
  to analyse grasps, manipulation skills, and whole-body support poses. Despite substantial
  efforts devoted to design their hierarchy and underlying categories, their use remains
  limited. This may be attributed to the lack of computational models that fill the
  gap between the discrete hierarchical structure of the taxonomy and the high-dimensional
  heterogeneous data associated to its categories. To overcome this problem, we propose
  to model taxonomy data via hyperbolic embeddings that capture the associated hierarchical
  structure. We achieve this by formulating a novel Gaussian process hyperbolic latent
  variable model that incorporates the taxonomy structure through graph-based priors
  on the latent space and distance-preserving back constraints. We validate our model
  on three different human motion taxonomies to learn hyperbolic embeddings that faithfully
  preserve the original graph structure. We show that our model properly encodes unseen
  data from existing or new taxonomy categories, and outperforms its Euclidean and
  VAE-based counterparts. Finally, through proof-of-concept experiments, we show that
  our model may be used to generate realistic trajectories between the learned embeddings.
