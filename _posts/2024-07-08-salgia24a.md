title: 'Random Exploration in Bayesian Optimization: Order-Optimal Regret and Computational
  Efficiency'
openreview: tOO6PD3kYP
abstract: We consider Bayesian optimization using Gaussian Process models, also referred
  to as kernel-based bandit optimization. We study the methodology of exploring the
  domain using random samples drawn from a distribution. We show that this random
  exploration approach achieves the optimal error rates. Our analysis is based on
  novel concentration bounds in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space established
  in this work, which may be of independent interest. We further develop an algorithm
  based on random exploration with domain shrinking and establish its order-optimal
  regret guarantees under both noise-free and noisy settings. In the noise-free setting,
  our analysis closes the existing gap in regret performance under a mild assumption
  on the underlying function and thereby <em>partially resolves a COLT open problem</em>.
  The proposed algorithm also enjoys a computational advantage over prevailing methods
  due to the random exploration that obviates the expensive optimization of a non-convex
  acquisition function for choosing the query points at each iteration.
