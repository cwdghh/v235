title: On dimensionality of feature vectors in MPNNs
openreview: UjDp4Wkq2V
abstract: We revisit the result of Morris et al. (AAAI’19) that message-passing graphs
  neural networks (MPNNs) are equal in their distinguishing power to the Weisfeiler–Leman
  (WL) isomorphism test. Morris et al. show their result with ReLU activation function
  and $O(n)$-dimensional feature vectors, where $n$ is the size of the graph. Recently,
  by introducing randomness into the architecture, Aamand et al. (NeurIPS’22) improved
  this bound to $O(\log n)$-dimensional feature vectors, although at the expense of
  guaranteeing perfect simulation only with high probability. In all these constructions,
  to guarantee equivalence to the WL test, the dimension of feature vectors in the
  MPNN has to increase with the size of the graphs. However, architectures used in
  practice have feature vectors of constant dimension. Thus, there is a gap between
  the guarantees provided by these results and the actual characteristics of architectures
  used in practice. In this paper we close this gap by showing that, for <em>any</em>
  non-polynomial analytic (like the sigmoid) activation function, to guarantee that
  MPNNs are equivalent to the WL test, feature vectors of dimension $d=1$ is all we
  need, independently of the size of the graphs. Our main technical insight is that
  for simulating multi-sets in the WL-test, it is enough to use linear independence
  of feature vectors over rationals instead of reals. Countability of the set of rationals
  together with nice properties of analytic functions allow us to carry out the simulation
  invariant over the iterations of the WL test without increasing the dimension of
  the feature vectors.
