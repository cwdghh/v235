title: Helpful or Harmful Data? Fine-tuning-free Shapley Attribution for Explaining
  Language Model Predictions
openreview: WSpPC1Jm0p
abstract: The increasing complexity of foundational models underscores the necessity
  for explainability, particularly for fine-tuning, the most widely used training
  method for adapting models to downstream tasks. Instance attribution, one type of
  explanation, attributes the model prediction to each training example by an instance
  score. However, the robustness of instance scores, specifically towards dataset
  resampling, has been overlooked. To bridge this gap, we propose a notion of robustness
  on the sign of the instance score. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate
  that the popular leave-one-out-based methods lack robustness, while the Shapley
  value behaves significantly better, but at a higher computational cost. Accordingly,
  we introduce an efficient fine-tuning-free approximation of the Shapley value (FreeShap)
  for instance attribution based on the neural tangent kernel. We empirically demonstrate
  that FreeShap outperforms other methods for instance attribution and other data-centric
  applications such as data removal, data selection, and wrong label detection, and
  further generalize our scale to large language models (LLMs). Our code is available
  at https://github.com/JTWang2000/FreeShap.
