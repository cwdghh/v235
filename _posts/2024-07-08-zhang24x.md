title: 'Towards Causal Foundation Model: on Duality between Optimal Balancing and
  Attention'
openreview: cFDaYtZR4u
abstract: Foundation models have brought changes to the landscape of machine learning,
  demonstrating sparks of human-level intelligence across a diverse array of tasks.
  However, a gap persists in complex tasks such as causal inference, primarily due
  to challenges associated with intricate reasoning steps and high numerical precision
  requirements. In this work, we take a first step towards building causally-aware
  foundation models for treatment effect estimations. We propose a novel, theoretically
  justified method called Causal Inference with Attention (CInA), which utilizes multiple
  unlabeled datasets to perform self-supervised causal learning, and subsequently
  enables zero-shot causal inference on unseen tasks with new data. This is based
  on our theoretical results that demonstrate the primal-dual connection between optimal
  covariate balancing and self-attention, facilitating zero-shot causal inference
  through the final layer of a trained transformer-type architecture. We demonstrate
  empirically that CInA effectively generalizes to out-of-distribution datasets and
  various real-world datasets, matching or even surpassing traditional per-dataset
  methodologies. These results provide compelling evidence that our method has the
  potential to serve as a stepping stone for the development of causal foundation
  models.
