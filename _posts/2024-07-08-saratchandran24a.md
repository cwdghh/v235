title: A sampling theory perspective on activations for implicit neural representations
openreview: cVkqItmYLQ
abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have gained popularity for encoding
  signals as compact, differentiable entities. While commonly using techniques like
  Fourier positional encodings or non-traditional activation functions (e.g., Gaussian,
  sinusoid, or wavelets) to capture high-frequency content, their properties lack
  exploration within a unified theoretical framework. Addressing this gap, we conduct
  a comprehensive analysis of these activations from a sampling theory perspective.
  Our investigation reveals that, especially in shallow INRs, $\mathrm{sinc}$ activations—previously
  unused in conjunction with INRs—are theoretically optimal for signal encoding. Additionally,
  we establish a connection between dynamical systems and INRs, leveraging sampling
  theory to bridge these two paradigms.
