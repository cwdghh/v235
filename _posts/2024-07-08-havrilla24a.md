title: 'GLoRe: When, Where, and How to Improve LLM Reasoning via Global and Local
  Refinements'
openreview: LH6R06NxdB
abstract: State-of-the-art language models can exhibit reasoning refinement capabilities
  on math, science or coding tasks. However, recent work demonstrates that even the
  best models struggle to identify <em>when and where to refine</em> without access
  to external feedback. In this paper, we propose Stepwise ORMs (<b>SORMs</b>) which
  are trained, only on synthetic data, to approximate the expected future reward of
  the optimal policy or $V^{\star}$ as a form of Process-based reward modeling. Our
  experiments show that SORMs can more accurately detect incorrect reasoning steps
  compared to ORMs, thus enabling them to give precise step-level feedback to refinement
  models. We then train <em>global</em> refinement models, which take only the question
  and a draft solution as input and predict a corrected solution, and <em>local</em>
  refinement models which also take as input a critique indicating the location of
  the first reasoning error. We generate training data for both models synthetically
  by reusing data used to train the SORM. We find combining global and local refinements,
  using the ORM as a reranker, significantly outperforms either one individually,
  as well as a best of three sample baseline. With this strategy we can improve the
  accuracy of a LLaMA-2 13B model (already fine-tuned with RL) on GSM8K from 53% to
  65% when greedily sampled.
