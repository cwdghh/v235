title: 'InterpreTabNet: Distilling Predictive Signals from Tabular Data by Salient
  Feature Interpretation'
openreview: or8BQ4ohGb
abstract: Tabular data are omnipresent in various sectors of industries. Neural networks
  for tabular data such as TabNet have been proposed to make predictions while leveraging
  the attention mechanism for interpretability. However, the inferred attention masks
  are often dense, making it challenging to come up with rationales about the predictive
  signal. To remedy this, we propose InterpreTabNet, a variant of the TabNet model
  that models the attention mechanism as a latent variable sampled from a Gumbel-Softmax
  distribution. This enables us to regularize the model to learn distinct concepts
  in the attention masks via a KL Divergence regularizer. It prevents overlapping
  feature selection by promoting sparsity which maximizes the modelâ€™s efficacy and
  improves interpretability to determine the important features when predicting the
  outcome. To assist in the interpretation of feature interdependencies from our model,
  we employ a large language model (GPT-4) and use prompt engineering to map from
  the learned feature mask onto natural language text describing the learned signal.
  Through comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that InterpreTabNet
  outperforms previous methods for interpreting tabular data while attaining competitive
  accuracy.
