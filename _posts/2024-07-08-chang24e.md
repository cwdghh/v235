title: 'From Biased Selective Labels to Pseudo-Labels: An Expectation-Maximization
  Framework for Learning from Biased Decisions'
openreview: hTiNFCNxM1
abstract: Selective labels occur when label observations are subject to a decision-making
  process; e.g., diagnoses that depend on the administration of laboratory tests.
  We study a clinically-inspired selective label problem called disparate censorship,
  where labeling biases vary across subgroups and unlabeled individuals are imputed
  as “negative” (i.e., no diagnostic test = no illness). Machine learning models naively
  trained on such labels could amplify labeling bias. Inspired by causal models of
  selective labels, we propose Disparate Censorship Expectation-Maximization (DCEM),
  an algorithm for learning in the presence of disparate censorship. We theoretically
  analyze how DCEM mitigates the effects of disparate censorship on model performance.
  We validate DCEM on synthetic data, showing that it improves bias mitigation (area
  between ROC curves) without sacrificing discriminative performance (AUC) compared
  to baselines. We achieve similar results in a sepsis classification task using clinical
  data.
