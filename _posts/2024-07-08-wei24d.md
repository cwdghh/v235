title: 'MMPareto: Boosting Multimodal Learning with Innocent Unimodal Assistance'
openreview: Hh8pUBfxXh
abstract: Multimodal learning methods with targeted unimodal learning objectives have
  exhibited their superior efficacy in alleviating the imbalanced multimodal learning
  problem. However, in this paper, we identify the previously ignored gradient conflict
  between multimodal and unimodal learning objectives, potentially misleading the
  unimodal encoder optimization. To well diminish these conflicts, we observe the
  discrepancy between multimodal loss and unimodal loss, where both gradient magnitude
  and covariance of the easier-to-learn multimodal loss are smaller than the unimodal
  one. With this property, we analyze Pareto integration under our multimodal scenario
  and propose MMPareto algorithm, which could ensure a final gradient with direction
  that is common to all learning objectives and enhanced magnitude to improve generalization,
  providing innocent unimodal assistance. Finally, experiments across multiple types
  of modalities and frameworks with dense cross-modal interaction indicate our superior
  and extendable method performance. Our method is also expected to facilitate multi-task
  cases with a clear discrepancy in task difficulty, demonstrating its ideal scalability.
