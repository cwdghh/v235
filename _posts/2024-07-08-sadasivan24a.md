title: Fast Adversarial Attacks on Language Models In One GPU Minute
openreview: wCMNbdshcY
abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel class of fast, beam search-based adversarial
  attack (BEAST) for Language Models (LMs). BEAST employs interpretable parameters,
  enabling attackers to balance between attack speed, success rate, and the readability
  of adversarial prompts. The computational efficiency of BEAST facilitates us to
  investigate its applications on LMs for jailbreaking, eliciting hallucinations,
  and privacy attacks. Our gradient-free targeted attack can jailbreak aligned LMs
  with high attack success rates within one minute. For instance, BEAST can jailbreak
  Vicuna-7B-v1.5 under one minute with a success rate of 89% when compared to a gradient-based
  baseline that takes over an hour to achieve 70% success rate using a single Nvidia
  RTX A6000 48GB GPU. BEAST can also generate adversarial suffixes for successful
  jailbreaks that can transfer to unseen prompts and unseen models such as GPT-4-Turbo.
  Additionally, we discover a unique outcome wherein our untargeted attack induces
  hallucinations in LM chatbots. Through human evaluations, we find that our untargeted
  attack causes Vicuna-7B-v1.5 to produce $\sim$15% more incorrect outputs when compared
  to LM outputs in the absence of our attack. We also learn that 22% of the time,
  BEAST causes Vicuna to generate outputs that are not relevant to the original prompt.
  Further, we use BEAST to generate adversarial prompts in a few seconds that can
  boost the performance of existing membership inference attacks for LMs. We believe
  that our fast attack, BEAST, has the potential to accelerate research in LM security
  and privacy.
