title: Uniform Memory Retrieval with Larger Capacity for Modern Hopfield Models
openreview: j5wf1NNhFs
abstract: 'We propose a two-stage optimization formulation for the memory retrieval
  dynamics of modern Hopfield models, termed $\mathtt{U\text{-}Hop}$. Our key contribution
  is a learnable feature map $\Phi$ which transforms the Hopfield energy function
  into a kernel space. This transformation ensures convergence between the local minima
  of energy and the fixed points of retrieval dynamics within the kernel space. Consequently,
  the kernel norm induced by $\Phi$ serves as a novel similarity measure. It utilizes
  the stored memory patterns as learning data to enhance memory capacity across all
  modern Hopfield models. Specifically, we accomplish this by constructing a separation
  loss $\mathcal{L}_\Phi$ that separates the local minima of kernelized energy by
  separating stored memory patterns in kernel space. Methodologically, $\mathtt{U\text{-}Hop}$
  memory retrieval process consists of: <b>(Stage I:)</b> minimizing separation loss
  for a more uniformed memory (local minimum) distribution, followed by <b>(Stage
  II:)</b> standard Hopfield energy minimization for memory retrieval. This results
  in significant reduction of possible meta-stable states in the Hopfield energy function,
  thus preventing memory confusion. Empirically, with real-world datasets, we demonstrate
  that $\mathtt{U\text{-}Hop}$ outperforms all existing modern Hopfield models and
  SOTA similarity measures, achieving a substantial margin in both associative memory
  retrieval and deep learning tasks. Code is available at GitHub; future updates are
  on arXiv.'
