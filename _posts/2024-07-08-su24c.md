title: Compositional Image Decomposition with Diffusion Models
openreview: 7zvl9mNQG2
abstract: Given an image of a natural scene, we are able to quickly decompose it into
  a set of components such as objects, lighting, shadows, and foreground. We can then
  envision a scene where we combine certain components with those from other images,
  for instance a set of objects from our bedroom and animals from a zoo under the
  lighting conditions of a forest, even if we have never encountered such a scene
  before. In this paper, we present a method to decompose an image into such compositional
  components. Our approach, Decomp Diffusion, is an unsupervised method which, when
  given a single image, infers a set of different components in the image, each represented
  by a diffusion model. We demonstrate how components can capture different factors
  of the scene, ranging from global scene descriptors like shadows or facial expression
  to local scene descriptors like constituent objects. We further illustrate how inferred
  factors can be flexibly composed, even with factors inferred from other models,
  to generate a variety of scenes sharply different than those seen in training time.
