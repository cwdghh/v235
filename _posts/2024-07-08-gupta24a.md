title: Diffusion Posterior Sampling is Computationally Intractable
openreview: tp6ruPIfIV
abstract: 'Diffusion models are a remarkably effective way of learning and sampling
  from a distribution $p(x)$. In posterior sampling, one is also given a measurement
  model $p(y \mid x)$ and a measurement $y$, and would like to sample from $p(x \mid
  y)$. Posterior sampling is useful for tasks such as inpainting, super-resolution,
  and MRI reconstruction, so a number of recent works have given algorithms to heuristically
  approximate it; but none are known to converge to the correct distribution in polynomial
  time. In this paper we show that posterior sampling is <em>computationally intractable</em>:
  under the most basic assumption in cryptography—that one-way functions exist—there
  are instances for which <em>every</em> algorithm takes superpolynomial time, even
  though <em>unconditional</em> sampling is provably fast. We also show that the exponential-time
  rejection sampling algorithm is essentially optimal under the stronger plausible
  assumption that there are one-way functions that take exponential time to invert.'
