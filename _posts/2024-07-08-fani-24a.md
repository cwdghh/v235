title: Accelerating Heterogeneous Federated Learning with Closed-form Classifiers
openreview: cMige5MK1N
abstract: 'Federated Learning (FL) methods often struggle in highly statistically
  heterogeneous settings. Indeed, non-IID data distributions cause client drift and
  biased local solutions, particularly pronounced in the final classification layer,
  negatively impacting convergence speed and accuracy. To address this issue, we introduce
  <em>Federated Recursive Ridge Regression</em> (Fed3R). Our method fits a Ridge Regression
  classifier computed in closed form leveraging pre-trained features. Fed3R is immune
  to statistical heterogeneity and is invariant to the sampling order of the clients.
  Therefore, it proves particularly effective in cross-device scenarios. Furthermore,
  it is fast and efficient in terms of communication and computation costs, requiring
  up to two orders of magnitude fewer resources than the competitors. Finally, we
  propose to leverage the Fed3R parameters as an initialization for a softmax classifier
  and subsequently fine-tune the model using any FL algorithm (Fed3R with Fine-Tuning,
  Fed3R+FT). Our findings also indicate that maintaining a fixed classifier aids in
  stabilizing the training and learning more discriminative features in cross-device
  settings. Official website: https://fed-3r.github.io/.'
