title: Open-Vocabulary Calibration for Fine-tuned CLIP
openreview: pY2UpspnBB
abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as formidable tools, showing
  their strong capability in handling various open-vocabulary tasks in image recognition,
  text-driven visual content generation, and visual chatbots, to name a few. In recent
  years, considerable efforts and resources have been devoted to adaptation methods
  for improving downstream performance of VLMs, particularly on parameter-efficient
  fine-tuning methods like prompt learning. However, a crucial aspect that has been
  largely overlooked is the confidence calibration problem in fine-tuned VLMs, which
  could greatly reduce reliability when deploying such models in the real world. This
  paper bridges the gap by systematically investigating the confidence calibration
  problem in the context of prompt learning and reveals that existing calibration
  methods are insufficient to address the problem, especially in the open-vocabulary
  setting. To solve the problem, we present a simple and effective approach called
  Distance-Aware Calibration (DAC), which is based on scaling the temperature using
  as guidance the distance between predicted text labels and base classes. The experiments
  with 7 distinct prompt learning methods applied across 11 diverse downstream datasets
  demonstrate the effectiveness of DAC, which achieves high efficacy without sacrificing
  the inference speed.
