title: Unleashing the Power of Meta-tuning for Few-shot Generalization Through Sparse
  Interpolated Experts
openreview: QhHMx51ir6
abstract: Recent successes suggest that parameter-efficient fine-tuning of foundation
  models is becoming the state-of-the-art method for transfer learning in vision,
  gradually replacing the rich literature of alternatives such as meta-learning. In
  trying to harness the best of both worlds, meta-tuning introduces a subsequent optimization
  stage of foundation models but has so far only shown limited success and crucially
  tends to underperform on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. In this paper, we introduce
  Sparse MetA-Tuning (SMAT), a method inspired by sparse mixture-of-experts approaches
  and trained to isolate subsets of pre-trained parameters automatically for meta-tuning
  on each task. SMAT successfully overcomes OOD sensitivity and delivers on the promise
  of enhancing the transfer abilities of vision foundation models beyond parameter-efficient
  finetuning. We establish new state-of-the-art results on a challenging combination
  of Meta-Dataset augmented with additional OOD tasks in both zero-shot and gradient-based
  adaptation settings. In addition, we provide a thorough analysis of the superiority
  of learned over hand-designed sparsity patterns for sparse expert methods and the
  pivotal importance of the sparsity level in balancing between in-distribution and
  out-of-distribution generalization. Our code and models are publicly available.
