title: Semantically-correlated memories in a dense associative model
openreview: l0OGoZPZuC
abstract: 'I introduce a novel associative memory model named <em>Correlated Dense
  Associative Memory</em> (CDAM), which integrates both auto- and hetero-association
  in a unified framework for continuous-valued memory patterns. Employing an arbitrary
  graph structure to semantically link memory patterns, CDAM is theoretically and
  numerically analysed, revealing four distinct dynamical modes: auto-association,
  narrow hetero-association, wide hetero-association, and neutral quiescence. Drawing
  inspiration from inhibitory modulation studies, I employ anti-Hebbian learning rules
  to control the range of hetero-association, extract multi-scale representations
  of community structures in graphs, and stabilise the recall of temporal sequences.
  Experimental demonstrations showcase CDAMâ€™s efficacy in handling real-world data,
  replicating a classical neuroscience experiment, performing image retrieval, and
  simulating arbitrary finite automata.'
