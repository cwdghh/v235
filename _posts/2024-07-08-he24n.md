title: Robust Multi-Task Learning with Excess Risks
openreview: JzWFmMySpn
abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) considers learning a joint model for multiple
  tasks by optimizing a convex combination of all task losses. To solve the optimization
  problem, existing methods use an adaptive weight updating scheme, where task weights
  are dynamically adjusted based on their respective losses to prioritize difficult
  tasks. However, these algorithms face a great challenge whenever <em>label noise</em>
  is present, in which case excessive weights tend to be assigned to noisy tasks that
  have relatively large Bayes optimal errors, thereby overshadowing other tasks and
  causing performance to drop across the board. To overcome this limitation, we propose
  <b>M</b>ulti-<b>T</b>ask <b>L</b>earning with <b>Excess</b> Risks (ExcessMTL), an
  excess risk-based task balancing method that updates the task weights by their distances
  to convergence instead. Intuitively, ExcessMTL assigns higher weights to worse-trained
  tasks that are further from convergence. To estimate the excess risks, we develop
  an efficient and accurate method with Taylor approximation. Theoretically, we show
  that our proposed algorithm achieves convergence guarantees and Pareto stationarity.
  Empirically, we evaluate our algorithm on various MTL benchmarks and demonstrate
  its superior performance over existing methods in the presence of label noise. Our
  code is available at https://github.com/yifei-he/ExcessMTL.
