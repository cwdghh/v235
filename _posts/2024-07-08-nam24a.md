title: Solving Poisson Equations using Neural Walk-on-Spheres
openreview: dQveBV9lZl
abstract: We propose Neural Walk-on-Spheres (NWoS), a novel neural PDE solver for
  the efficient solution of high-dimensional Poisson equations. Leveraging stochastic
  representations and Walk-on-Spheres methods, we develop novel losses for neural
  networks based on the recursive solution of Poisson equations on spheres inside
  the domain. The resulting method is highly parallelizable and does not require spatial
  gradients for the loss. We provide a comprehensive comparison against competing
  methods based on PINNs, the Deep Ritz method, and (backward) stochastic differential
  equations. In several challenging, high-dimensional numerical examples, we demonstrate
  the superiority of NWoS in accuracy, speed, and computational costs. Compared to
  commonly used PINNs, our approach can reduce memory usage and errors by orders of
  magnitude. Furthermore, we apply NWoS to problems in PDE-constrained optimization
  and molecular dynamics to show its efficiency in practical applications.
