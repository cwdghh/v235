title: 'Amend to Alignment: Decoupled Prompt Tuning for Mitigating Spurious Correlation
  in Vision-Language Models'
openreview: f8G2KSCSdp
abstract: 'Fine-tuning the learnable prompt for a pre-trained vision-language model
  (VLM), such as CLIP, has demonstrated exceptional efficiency in adapting to a broad
  range of downstream tasks. Existing prompt tuning methods for VLMs do not distinguish
  spurious features introduced by biased training data from invariant features, and
  employ a uniform alignment process when adapting to unseen target domains. This
  can impair the cross-modal feature alignment when the testing data significantly
  deviate from the distribution of the training data, resulting in a poor out-of-distribution
  (OOD) generalization performance. In this paper, we reveal that the prompt tuning
  failure in such OOD scenarios can be attribute to the undesired alignment between
  the textual and the spurious feature. As a solution, we propose <b>CoOPood</b>,
  a fine-grained prompt tuning method that can discern the causal features and deliberately
  align the text modality with the invariant feature. Specifically, we design two
  independent contrastive phases using two lightweight projection layers during the
  alignment, each with different objectives: 1) pulling the text embedding closer
  to invariant image embedding and 2) pushing text embedding away from spurious image
  embedding. We have illustrated that <b>CoOPood</b> can serve as a general framework
  for VLMs and can be seamlessly integrated with existing prompt tuning methods. Extensive
  experiments on various OOD datasets demonstrate the performance superiority over
  state-of-the-art methods.'
