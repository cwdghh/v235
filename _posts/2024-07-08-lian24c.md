title: 'Diving into Underwater: Segment Anything Model Guided Underwater Salient Instance
  Segmentation and A Large-scale Dataset'
openreview: snhurpZt63
abstract: With the breakthrough of large models, Segment Anything Model (SAM) and
  its extensions have been attempted to apply in diverse tasks of computer vision.
  Underwater salient instance segmentation is a foundational and vital step for various
  underwater vision tasks, which often suffer from low segmentation accuracy due to
  the complex underwater circumstances and the adaptive ability of models. Moreover,
  the lack of large-scale datasets with pixel-level salient instance annotations has
  impeded the development of machine learning techniques in this field. To address
  these issues, we construct the first large-scale underwater salient instance segmentation
  dataset (USIS10K), which contains 10,632 underwater images with pixel-level annotations
  in 7 categories from various underwater scenes. Then, we propose an Underwater Salient
  Instance Segmentation architecture based on Segment Anything Model (USIS-SAM) specifically
  for the underwater domain. We devise an Underwater Adaptive Visual Transformer (UA-ViT)
  encoder to incorporate underwater domain visual prompts into the segmentation network.
  We further design an out-of-the-box underwater Salient Feature Prompter Generator
  (SFPG) to automatically generate salient prompters instead of explicitly providing
  foreground points or boxes as prompts in SAM. Comprehensive experimental results
  show that our USIS-SAM method can achieve superior performance on USIS10K datasets
  compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Datasets and codes are released on https://github.com/LiamLian0727/USIS10K.
