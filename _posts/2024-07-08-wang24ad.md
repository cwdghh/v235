title: Total Variation Floodgate for Variable Importance Inference in Classification
openreview: IyeXM58vIC
abstract: Inferring variable importance is the key goal of many scientific studies,
  where researchers seek to learn the effect of a feature $X$ on the outcome $Y$ in
  the presence of confounding variables $Z$. Focusing on classification problems,
  we define the expected total variation (ETV), which is an intuitive and deterministic
  measure of variable importance that does not rely on any model assumption. We then
  introduce algorithms for statistical inference on the ETV under design-based/model-X
  assumptions. We name our method Total Variation Floodgate in reference to its shared
  high-level structure with the Floodgate method of Zhang & Janson (2020). The algorithms
  we introduce can leverage any user-specified regression function and produce asymptotic
  lower confidence bounds for the ETV. We show the effectiveness of our algorithms
  with simulations and a case study in conjoint analysis on the US general election.
