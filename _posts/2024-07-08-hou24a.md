title: 'IBD-PSC: Input-level Backdoor Detection via Parameter-oriented Scaling Consistency'
openreview: YCzbfs2few
abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries
  can maliciously trigger model misclassifications by implanting a hidden backdoor
  during model training. This paper proposes a simple yet effective input-level backdoor
  detection (dubbed IBD-PSC) as a ‘firewall’ to filter out malicious testing images.
  Our method is motivated by an intriguing phenomenon, i.e., parameter-oriented scaling
  consistency (PSC), where the prediction confidences of poisoned samples are significantly
  more consistent than those of benign ones when amplifying model parameters. In particular,
  we provide theoretical analysis to safeguard the foundations of the PSC phenomenon.
  We also design an adaptive method to select BN layers to scale up for effective
  detection. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets, verifying
  the effectiveness and efficiency of our IBD-PSC method and its resistance to adaptive
  attacks. Codes are available at https://github.com/THUYimingLi/BackdoorBox.
