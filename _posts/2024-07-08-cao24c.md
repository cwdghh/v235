title: Predictive Dynamic Fusion
openreview: LYpGLrC4oq
abstract: Multimodal fusion is crucial in joint decision-making systems for rendering
  holistic judgments. Since multimodal data changes in open environments, dynamic
  fusion has emerged and achieved remarkable progress in numerous applications. However,
  most existing dynamic multimodal fusion methods lack theoretical guarantees and
  easily fall into suboptimal problems, yielding unreliability and instability. To
  address this issue, we propose a Predictive Dynamic Fusion (PDF) framework for multimodal
  learning. We proceed to reveal the multimodal fusion from a generalization perspective
  and theoretically derive the predictable Collaborative Belief (Co-Belief) with Mono-
  and Holo-Confidence, which provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error.
  Accordingly, we further propose a relative calibration strategy to calibrate the
  predicted Co-Belief for potential uncertainty. Extensive experiments on multiple
  benchmarks confirm our superiority. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yinan-Xia/PDF.
