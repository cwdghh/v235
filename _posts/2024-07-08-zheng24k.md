title: Detecting and Identifying Selection Structure in Sequential Data
openreview: 5PQhu8flSO
abstract: We argue that the selective inclusion of data points based on latent objectives
  is common in practical situations, such as music sequences. Since this selection
  process often distorts statistical analysis, previous work primarily views it as
  a bias to be corrected and proposes various methods to mitigate its effect. However,
  while controlling this bias is crucial, selection also offers an opportunity to
  provide a deeper insight into the hidden generation process, as it is a fundamental
  mechanism underlying what we observe. In particular, overlooking selection in sequential
  data can lead to an incomplete or overcomplicated inductive bias in modeling, such
  as assuming a universal autoregressive structure for all dependencies. Therefore,
  rather than merely viewing it as a bias, we explore the causal structure of selection
  in sequential data to delve deeper into the complete causal process. Specifically,
  we show that selection structure is identifiable without any parametric assumptions
  or interventional experiments. Moreover, even in cases where selection variables
  coexist with latent confounders, we still establish the nonparametric identifiability
  under appropriate structural conditions. Meanwhile, we also propose a provably correct
  algorithm to detect and identify selection structures as well as other types of
  dependencies. The framework has been validated empirically on both synthetic data
  and real-world music.
