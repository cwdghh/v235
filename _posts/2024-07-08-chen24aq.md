title: Subequivariant Reinforcement Learning in 3D Multi-Entity Physical Environments
openreview: hQpUhySEJi
abstract: Learning policies for multi-entity systems in 3D environments is far more
  complicated against single-entity scenarios, due to the exponential expansion of
  the global state space as the number of entities increases. One potential solution
  of alleviating the exponential complexity is dividing the global space into independent
  local views that are invariant to transformations including translations and rotations.
  To this end, this paper proposes <em>Subequivariant Hierarchical Neural Networks</em>
  (SHNN) to facilitate multi-entity policy learning. In particular, SHNN first dynamically
  decouples the global space into local entity-level graphs via task assignment. Second,
  it leverages subequivariant message passing over the local entity-level graphs to
  devise local reference frames, remarkably compressing the representation redundancy,
  particularly in gravity-affected environments. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations
  of existing benchmarks in capturing the subtleties of multi-entity systems under
  the Euclidean symmetry, we propose the <em>Multi-entity Benchmark</em> (MEBEN),
  a new suite of environments tailored for exploring a wide range of multi-entity
  reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant advancements
  of SHNN on the proposed benchmarks compared to existing methods. Comprehensive ablations
  are conducted to verify the indispensability of task assignment and subequivariance.
