title: Long Range Propagation on Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs
openreview: gVg8V9isul
abstract: Learning Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs (C-TDGs) requires accurately modeling
  spatio-temporal information on streams of irregularly sampled events. While many
  methods have been proposed recently, we find that most message passing-, recurrent-
  or self-attention-based methods perform poorly on <em>long-range</em> tasks. These
  tasks require correlating information that occurred "far" away from the current
  event, either spatially (higher-order node information) or along the time dimension
  (events occurred in the past). To address long-range dependencies, we introduce
  Continuous-Time Graph Anti-Symmetric Network (CTAN). Grounded within the ordinary
  differential equations framework, our method is designed for efficient propagation
  of information. In this paper, we show how CTAN’s (i) long-range modeling capabilities
  are substantiated by theoretical findings and how (ii) its empirical performance
  on synthetic long-range benchmarks and real-world benchmarks is superior to other
  methods. Our results motivate CTAN’s ability to propagate long-range information
  in C-TDGs as well as the inclusion of long-range tasks as part of temporal graph
  models evaluation.
