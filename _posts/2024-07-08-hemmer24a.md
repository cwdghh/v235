title: Optimal Recurrent Network Topologies for Dynamical Systems Reconstruction
openreview: HZyOz9VEg4
abstract: In dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) we seek to infer from time series
  measurements a generative model of the underlying dynamical process. This is a prime
  objective in any scientific discipline, where we are particularly interested in
  parsimonious models with a low parameter load. A common strategy here is parameter
  pruning, removing all parameters with small weights. However, here we find this
  strategy does not work for DSR, where even low magnitude parameters can contribute
  considerably to the system dynamics. On the other hand, it is well known that many
  natural systems which generate complex dynamics, like the brain or ecological networks,
  have a sparse topology with comparatively few links. Inspired by this, we show that
  <em>geometric pruning</em>, where in contrast to magnitude-based pruning weights
  with a low contribution to an attractor’s geometrical structure are removed, indeed
  manages to reduce parameter load substantially without significantly hampering DSR
  quality. We further find that the networks resulting from geometric pruning have
  a specific type of topology, and that this topology, and not the magnitude of weights,
  is what is most crucial to performance. We provide an algorithm that automatically
  generates such topologies which can be used as priors for generative modeling of
  dynamical systems by RNNs, and compare it to other well studied topologies like
  small-world or scale-free networks.
