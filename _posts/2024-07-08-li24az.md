title: A Contextual Combinatorial Bandit Approach to Negotiation
openreview: 9BWRs6XF8P
abstract: 'Learning effective negotiation strategies poses two key challenges: the
  exploration-exploitation dilemma and dealing with large action spaces. However,
  there is an absence of learning-based approaches that effectively address these
  challenges in negotiation. This paper introduces a comprehensive formulation to
  tackle various negotiation problems. Our approach leverages contextual combinatorial
  multi-armed bandits, with the bandits resolving the exploration-exploitation dilemma,
  and the combinatorial nature handles large action spaces. Building upon this formulation,
  we introduce NegUCB, a novel method that also handles common issues such as partial
  observations and complex reward functions in negotiation. NegUCB is contextual and
  tailored for full-bandit feedback without constraints on the reward functions. Under
  mild assumptions, it ensures a sub-linear regret upper bound. Experiments conducted
  on three negotiation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach.'
