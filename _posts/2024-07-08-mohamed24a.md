title: 'Straight-Through Meets Sparse Recovery: the Support Exploration Algorithm'
openreview: Oj18qGN1gC
abstract: 'The <em>straight-through estimator</em> (STE) is commonly used to optimize
  quantized neural networks, yet its contexts of effective performance are still unclear
  despite empirical successes. To make a step forward in this comprehension, we apply
  STE to a well-understood problem: <em>sparse support recovery</em>. We introduce
  the <em>Support Exploration Algorithm</em> (SEA), a novel algorithm promoting sparsity,
  and we analyze its performance in support recovery (a.k.a. model selection) problems.
  SEA explores more supports than the state-of-the-art, leading to superior performance
  in experiments, especially when the columns of $A$ are strongly coherent. The theoretical
  analysis considers recovery guarantees when the linear measurements matrix $A$ satisfies
  the <em>Restricted Isometry Property</em> (RIP). The sufficient conditions of recovery
  are comparable but more stringent than those of the state-of-the-art in sparse support
  recovery. Their significance lies mainly in their applicability to an instance of
  the STE.'
