title: Debiased Offline Representation Learning for Fast Online Adaptation in Non-stationary
  Dynamics
openreview: BrZPj9rEpN
abstract: Developing policies that can adapt to non-stationary environments is essential
  for real-world reinforcement learning applications. Nevertheless, learning such
  adaptable policies in offline settings, with only a limited set of pre-collected
  trajectories, presents significant challenges. A key difficulty arises because the
  limited offline data makes it hard for the context encoder to differentiate between
  changes in the environment dynamics and shifts in the behavior policy, often leading
  to context misassociations. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach
  called debiased offline representation learning for fast online adaptation (DORA).
  DORA incorporates an information bottleneck principle that maximizes mutual information
  between the dynamics encoding and the environmental data, while minimizing mutual
  information between the dynamics encoding and the actions of the behavior policy.
  We present a practical implementation of DORA, leveraging tractable bounds of the
  information bottleneck principle. Our experimental evaluation across six benchmark
  MuJoCo tasks with variable parameters demonstrates that DORA not only achieves a
  more precise dynamics encoding but also significantly outperforms existing baselines
  in terms of performance.
