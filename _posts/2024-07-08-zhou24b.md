title: Differentially Private Worst-group Risk Minimization
openreview: ElNxZ40tBJ
abstract: We initiate a systematic study of worst-group risk minimization under $(\epsilon,
  \delta)$-differential privacy (DP). The goal is to privately find a model that approximately
  minimizes the maximal risk across $p$ sub-populations (groups) with different distributions,
  where each group distribution is accessed via a sample oracle. We first present
  a new algorithm that achieves excess worst-group population risk of $\tilde{O}(\frac{p\sqrt{d}}{K\epsilon}
  + \sqrt{\frac{p}{K}})$, where $K$ is the total number of samples drawn from all
  groups and $d$ is the problem dimension. Our rate is nearly optimal when each distribution
  is observed via a fixed-size dataset of size $K/p$. Our result is based on a new
  stability-based analysis for the generalization error. In particular, we show that
  $\Delta$-uniform argument stability implies $\tilde{O}(\Delta + \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$
  generalization error w.r.t. the worst-group risk, where $n$ is the number of samples
  drawn from each sample oracle. Next, we propose an algorithmic framework for worst-group
  population risk minimization using any DP online convex optimization algorithm as
  a subroutine. Hence, we give another excess risk bound of $\tilde{O}\left( \sqrt{\frac{d^{1/2}}{\epsilon
  K}} +\sqrt{\frac{p}{K\epsilon^2}} + \sqrt{\frac{p}{K}} \right)$. Assuming the typical
  setting of $\epsilon=\Theta(1)$, this bound is more favorable than our first bound
  in a certain range of $p$ as a function of $K$ and $d$. Finally, we study differentially
  private worst-group <em>empirical</em> risk minimization in the offline setting,
  where each group distribution is observed by a fixed-size dataset. We present a
  new algorithm with nearly optimal excess risk of $\tilde{O}(\frac{p\sqrt{d}}{K\epsilon})$.
