title: 'VisionGraph: Leveraging Large Multimodal Models for Graph Theory Problems
  in Visual Context'
openreview: gjoUXwuZdy
abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved impressive success in visual
  reasoning, particularly in visual mathematics. However, problem-solving capabilities
  in graph theory remain less explored for LMMs, despite being a crucial aspect of
  mathematical reasoning that requires an accurate understanding of graphical structures
  and multi-step reasoning on visual graphs. To step forward in this direction, we
  are the first to design a benchmark named <b>VisionGraph</b>, used to explore the
  capabilities of advanced LMMs in solving multimodal graph theory problems. It encompasses
  eight complex graph problem tasks, from connectivity to shortest path problems.
  Subsequently, we present a Description-Program-Reasoning (DPR) chain to enhance
  the logical accuracy of reasoning processes through graphical structure description
  generation and algorithm-aware multi-step reasoning. Our extensive study shows that
  1) GPT-4V outperforms Gemini Pro in multi-step graph reasoning; 2) All LMMs exhibit
  inferior perception accuracy for graphical structures, whether in zero/few-shot
  settings or with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which further affects problem-solving
  performance; 3) DPR significantly improves the multi-step graph reasoning capabilities
  of LMMs and the GPT-4V (DPR) agent achieves SOTA performance.
