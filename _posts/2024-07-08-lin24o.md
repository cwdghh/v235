title: Fast and Sample Efficient Multi-Task Representation Learning in Stochastic
  Contextual Bandits
openreview: uog14iBFLA
abstract: We study how representation learning can improve the learning efficiency
  of contextual bandit problems. We study the setting where we play T linear contextual
  bandits with dimension simultaneously, and these T bandit tasks collectively share
  a common linear representation with a dimensionality of r â‰ª d. We present a new
  algorithm based on alternating projected gradient descent (GD) and minimization
  estimator to recover a low-rank feature matrix. We obtain constructive provable
  guarantees for our estimator that provide a lower bound on the required sample complexity
  and an upper bound on the iteration complexity (total number of iterations needed
  to achieve a certain error level). Using the proposed estimator, we present a multi-task
  learning algorithm for linear contextual bandits and prove the regret bound of our
  algorithm. We presented experiments and compared the performance of our algorithm
  against benchmark algorithms.
