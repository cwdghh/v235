title: Submodular framework for structured-sparse optimal transport
openreview: bfQCO9Vqhk
abstract: Unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) has recently gained much attention due
  to its flexible framework for handling un-normalized measures and its robustness
  properties. In this work, we explore learning (structured) sparse transport plans
  in the UOT setting, i.e., transport plans have an upper bound on the number of non-sparse
  entries in each column (structured sparse pattern) or in the whole plan (general
  sparse pattern). We propose novel sparsity-constrained UOT formulations building
  on the recently explored maximum mean discrepancy based UOT. We show that the proposed
  optimization problem is equivalent to the maximization of a weakly submodular function
  over a uniform matroid or a partition matroid. We develop efficient gradient-based
  discrete greedy algorithms and provide the corresponding theoretical guarantees.
  Empirically, we observe that our proposed greedy algorithms select a diverse support
  set and we illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in various applications.
