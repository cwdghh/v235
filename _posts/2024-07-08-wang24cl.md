title: An Empirical Study of Realized GNN Expressiveness
openreview: WIaZFk02fI
abstract: 'Research on the theoretical expressiveness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
  has developed rapidly, and many methods have been proposed to enhance the expressiveness.
  However, most methods do not have a uniform expressiveness measure except for a
  few that strictly follow the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman ($k$-WL) test hierarchy,
  leading to difficulties in quantitatively comparing their expressiveness. Previous
  research has attempted to use datasets for measurement, but facing problems with
  difficulty (any model surpassing 1-WL has nearly 100% accuracy), granularity (models
  tend to be either 100% correct or near random guess), and scale (only several essentially
  different graphs involved). To address these limitations, we study the realized
  expressive power that a practical model instance can achieve using a novel expressiveness
  dataset, BREC, which poses greater difficulty (with up to 4-WL-indistinguishable
  graphs), finer granularity (enabling comparison of models between 1-WL and 3-WL),
  a larger scale (consisting of 800 1-WL-indistinguishable graphs that are non-isomorphic
  to each other). We synthetically test 23 models with higher-than-1-WL expressiveness
  on BREC. Our experiment gives the first thorough measurement of the realized expressiveness
  of those state-of-the-art beyond-1-WL GNN models and reveals the gap between theoretical
  and realized expressiveness. Dataset and evaluation codes are released at: https://github.com/GraphPKU/BREC.'
