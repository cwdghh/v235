title: 'Rethinking Data Shapley for Data Selection Tasks: Misleads and Merits'
openreview: mKYBMf1hHG
abstract: Data Shapley provides a principled approach to data valuation and plays
  a crucial role in data-centric machine learning (ML) research. Data selection is
  considered a standard application of Data Shapley. However, its data selection performance
  has shown to be inconsistent across settings in the literature. This study aims
  to deepen our understanding of this phenomenon. We introduce a hypothesis testing
  framework and show that Data Shapley’s performance can be no better than random
  selection without specific constraints on utility functions. We identify a class
  of utility functions, monotonically transformed modular functions, within which
  Data Shapley optimally selects data. Based on this insight, we propose a heuristic
  for predicting Data Shapley’s effectiveness in data selection tasks. Our experiments
  corroborate these findings, adding new insights into when Data Shapley may or may
  not succeed.
