title: 'From Fourier to Neural ODEs: Flow Matching for Modeling Complex Systems'
openreview: E4qjDAdVte
abstract: Modeling complex systems using standard neural ordinary differential equations
  (NODEs) often faces some essential challenges, including high computational costs
  and susceptibility to local optima. To address these challenges, we propose a simulation-free
  framework, called Fourier NODEs (FNODEs), that effectively trains NODEs by directly
  matching the target vector field based on Fourier analysis. Specifically, we employ
  the Fourier analysis to estimate temporal and potential high-order spatial gradients
  from noisy observational data. We then incorporate the estimated spatial gradients
  as additional inputs to a neural network. Furthermore, we utilize the estimated
  temporal gradient as the optimization objective for the output of the neural network.
  Later, the trained neural network generates more data points through an ODE solver
  without participating in the computational graph, facilitating more accurate estimations
  of gradients based on Fourier analysis. These two steps form a positive feedback
  loop, enabling accurate dynamics modeling in our framework. Consequently, our approach
  outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of training time, dynamics prediction,
  and robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the superior performance of our framework
  using a number of representative complex systems.
