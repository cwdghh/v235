title: Improved Generalization of Weight Space Networks via Augmentations
openreview: 3o7G6tIo4X
abstract: Learning in deep weight spaces (DWS), where neural networks process the
  weights of other neural networks, is an emerging research direction, with applications
  to 2D and 3D neural fields (INRs, NeRFs), as well as making inferences about other
  types of neural networks. Unfortunately, weight space models tend to suffer from
  substantial overfitting. We empirically analyze the reasons for this overfitting
  and find that a key reason is the lack of diversity in DWS datasets. While a given
  object can be represented by many different weight configurations, typical INR training
  sets fail to capture variability across INRs that represent the same object. To
  address this, we explore strategies for data augmentation in weight spaces and propose
  a MixUp method adapted for weight spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these
  methods in two setups. In classification, they improve performance similarly to
  having up to 10 times more data. In self-supervised contrastive learning, they yield
  substantial 5-10% gains in downstream classification.
