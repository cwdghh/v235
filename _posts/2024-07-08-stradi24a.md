title: 'Online Learning in CMDPs: Handling Stochastic and Adversarial Constraints'
openreview: Qv5szC1zp7
abstract: We study online learning in episodic constrained Markov decision processes
  (CMDPs), where the learner aims at collecting as much reward as possible over the
  episodes, while satisfying some long-term constraints during the learning process.
  Rewards and constraints can be selected either stochastically or adversarially,
  and the transition function is not known to the learner. While online learning in
  classical (unconstrained) MDPs has received considerable attention over the last
  years, the setting of CMDPs is still largely unexplored. This is surprising, since
  in real-world applications, such as, e.g., autonomous driving, automated bidding,
  and recommender systems, there are usually additional constraints and specifications
  that an agent has to obey during the learning process. In this paper, we provide
  the first best-of-both-worlds algorithm for CMDPs with long-term constraints, in
  the flavor of Balseiro et al. (2023). Our algorithm is capable of handling settings
  in which rewards and constraints are selected either stochastically or adversarially,
  without requiring any knowledge of the underling process. Moreover, our algorithm
  matches state-of-the-art regret and constraint violation bounds for settings in
  which constraints are selected stochastically, while it is the first to provide
  guarantees in the case in which they are chosen adversarially.
