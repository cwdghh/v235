title: Rethinking Independent Cross-Entropy Loss For Graph-Structured Data
openreview: zrQIc9mQQN
abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited prominent performance in learning
  graph-structured data. Considering node classification task, based on the i.i.d
  assumption among node labels, the traditional supervised learning simply sums up
  cross-entropy losses of the independent training nodes and applies the average loss
  to optimize GNNs’ weights. But different from other data formats, the nodes are
  naturally connected. It is found that the independent distribution modeling of node
  labels restricts GNNs’ capability to generalize over the entire graph and defend
  adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose a new framework, termed joint-cluster
  supervised learning, to model the joint distribution of each node with its corresponding
  cluster. We learn the joint distribution of node and cluster labels conditioned
  on their representations, and train GNNs with the obtained joint loss. In this way,
  the data-label reference signals extracted from the local cluster explicitly strengthen
  the discrimination ability on the target node. The extensive experiments demonstrate
  that our joint-cluster supervised learning can effectively bolster GNNs’ node classification
  accuracy. Furthermore, being benefited from the reference signals which may be free
  from spiteful interference, our learning paradigm significantly protects the node
  classification from being affected by the adversarial attack.
