title: 'Premier-TACO is a Few-Shot Policy Learner: Pretraining Multitask Representation
  via Temporal Action-Driven Contrastive Loss'
openreview: KSNl7VgeVr
abstract: We present Premier-TACO, a multitask feature representation learning approach
  designed to improve few-shot policy learning efficiency in sequential decision-making
  tasks. Premier-TACO leverages a subset of multitask offline datasets for pretraining
  a general feature representation, which captures critical environmental dynamics
  and is fine-tuned using minimal expert demonstrations. It advances the temporal
  action contrastive learning (TACO) objective, known for state-of-the-art results
  in visual control tasks, by incorporating a novel negative example sampling strategy.
  This strategy is crucial in significantly boosting TACO’s computational efficiency,
  making large-scale multitask offline pretraining feasible. Our extensive empirical
  evaluation in a diverse set of continuous control benchmarks including Deepmind
  Control Suite, MetaWorld, and LIBERO demonstrate Premier-TACO’s effective- ness
  in pretraining visual representations, significantly enhancing few-shot imitation
  learning of novel tasks.
