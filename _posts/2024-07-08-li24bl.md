title: 'Compress Clean Signal from Noisy Raw Image: A Self-Supervised Approach'
openreview: 5sgkNtexs2
abstract: Raw images offer unique advantages in many low-level visual tasks due to
  their unprocessed nature. However, this unprocessed state accentuates noise, making
  raw images challenging to compress effectively. Current compression methods often
  overlook the ubiquitous noise in raw space, leading to increased bitrates and reduced
  quality. In this paper, we propose a novel raw image compression scheme that selectively
  compresses the noise-free component of the input, while discarding its real noise
  using a self-supervised approach. By excluding noise from the bitstream, both the
  coding efficiency and reconstruction quality are significantly enhanced. We curate
  an full-day dataset of raw images with calibrated noise parameters and reference
  images to evaluate the performance of models under a wide range of input signal-noise
  ratios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing compression
  techniques, achieving a more advantageous rate-distortion balance with improvements
  ranging from +2 to +10dB and yielding a bit saving of 2 to 50 times. The code will
  be released upon paper acceptance.
