title: 'Position: Technical Research and Talent is Needed for Effective AI Governance'
openreview: Be2B6f0ps1
abstract: In light of recent advancements in AI capabilities and the increasingly
  widespread integration of AI systems into society, governments worldwide are actively
  seeking to mitigate the potential harms and risks associated with these technologies
  through regulation and other governance tools. However, there exist significant
  gaps between governance aspirations and the current state of the technical tooling
  necessary for their realisation. In this position paper, we survey policy documents
  published by public-sector institutions in the EU, US, and China to highlight specific
  areas of disconnect between the technical requirements necessary for enacting proposed
  policy actions, and the current technical state of the art. Our analysis motivates
  a call for tighter integration of the AI/ML research community within AI governance
  in order to i) catalyse technical research aimed at bridging the gap between current
  and supposed technical underpinnings of regulatory action, as well as ii) increase
  the level of technical expertise within governing institutions so as to inform and
  guide effective governance of AI.
