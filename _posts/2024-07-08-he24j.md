title: Ambiguity-Aware Abductive Learning
openreview: sqv2xP8rfb
abstract: Abductive Learning (ABL) is a promising framework for integrating sub-symbolic
  perception and logical reasoning through abduction. In this case, the abduction
  process provides supervision for the perception model from the background knowledge.
  Nevertheless, this process naturally contains uncertainty, since the knowledge base
  may be satisfied by numerous potential candidates. This implies that the result
  of the abduction process, i.e., a set of candidates, is ambiguous; both correct
  and incorrect candidates are mixed in this set. The prior art of abductive learning
  selects the candidate that has the minimal inconsistency of the knowledge base.
  However, this method overlooks the ambiguity in the abduction process and is prone
  to error when it fails to identify the correct candidates. To address this, we propose
  Ambiguity-Aware Abductive Learning ($\textrm{A}^3\textrm{BL}$), which evaluates
  all potential candidates and their probabilities, thus preventing the model from
  falling into sub-optimal solutions. Both experimental results and theoretical analyses
  prove that $\textrm{A}^3\textrm{BL}$ markedly enhances ABL by efficiently exploiting
  the ambiguous abduced supervision.
