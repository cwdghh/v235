title: Surprisingly Strong Performance Prediction with Neural Graph Features
openreview: EhPpZV6KLk
abstract: Performance prediction has been a key part of the neural architecture search
  (NAS) process, allowing to speed up NAS algorithms by avoiding resource-consuming
  network training. Although many performance predictors correlate well with ground
  truth performance, they require training data in the form of trained networks. Recently,
  zero-cost proxies have been proposed as an efficient method to estimate network
  performance without any training. However, they are still poorly understood, exhibit
  biases with network properties, and their performance is limited. Inspired by the
  drawbacks of zero-cost proxies, we propose neural graph features (GRAF), simple
  to compute properties of architectural graphs. GRAF offers fast and interpretable
  performance prediction while outperforming zero-cost proxies and other common encodings.
  In combination with other zero-cost proxies, GRAF outperforms most existing performance
  predictors at a fraction of the cost.
