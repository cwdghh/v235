title: 'FairProof : Confidential and Certifiable Fairness for Neural Networks'
openreview: EKye56rLuv
abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly used in societal applications,
  yet legal and privacy concerns demand that they very often be kept confidential.
  Consequently, there is a growing distrust about the fairness properties of these
  models in the minds of consumers, who are often at the receiving end of model predictions.
  To this end, we propose <em>Fairproof</em> â€“ a system that uses Zero-Knowledge Proofs
  (a cryptographic primitive) to publicly verify the fairness of a model, while maintaining
  confidentiality. We also propose a fairness certification algorithm for fully-connected
  neural networks which is befitting to ZKPs and is used in this system. We implement
  <em>Fairproof</em> in Gnark and demonstrate empirically that our system is practically
  feasible. Code is available at https://github.com/infinite-pursuits/FairProof.
