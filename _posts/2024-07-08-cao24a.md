title: Successor Features for Efficient Multi-Subject Controlled Text Generation
openreview: LJcIIhqGDN
abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance
  in generating fluent and realistic text, controlling the generated text so that
  it exhibits properties such as safety, factuality, and non-toxicity remains challenging.
  Existing decoding-based controllable text generation methods are static in terms
  of the dimension of control; if the target subject is changed, they require new
  training. Moreover, it can quickly become prohibitive to concurrently control multiple
  subjects. To address these challenges, we first show that existing methods can be
  framed as a reinforcement learning problem, where an action-value function estimates
  the likelihood of a desired attribute appearing in the generated text. Then, we
  introduce a novel approach named SF-Gen, which leverages the concept of successor
  features to decouple the dynamics of LLMs from task-specific rewards. By employing
  successor features, our method proves to be memory-efficient and computationally
  efficient for both training and decoding, especially when dealing with multiple
  target subjects. To the best of our knowledge, our research represents the first
  application of successor features in text generation. In addition to its computational
  efficiency, the resultant language produced by our method is comparable to the SOTA
  (and outperforms baselines) in both control measures as well as language quality,
  which we demonstrate through a series of experiments in various controllable text
  generation tasks.
