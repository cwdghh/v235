title: Parallelized Spatiotemporal Slot Binding for Videos
openreview: KpeGdDzucX
abstract: While modern best practices advocate for scalable architectures that support
  long-range interactions, object-centric models are yet to fully embrace these architectures.
  In particular, existing object-centric models for handling sequential inputs, due
  to their reliance on RNN-based implementation, show poor stability and capacity
  and are slow to train on long sequences. We introduce Parallelizable Spatiotemporal
  Binder or PSB, the first temporally-parallelizable slot learning architecture for
  sequential inputs. Unlike conventional RNN-based approaches, PSB produces object-centric
  representations, known as slots, for all time-steps in parallel. This is achieved
  by refining the initial slots across all time-steps through a fixed number of layers
  equipped with causal attention. By capitalizing on the parallelism induced by our
  architecture, the proposed model exhibits a significant boost in efficiency. In
  experiments, we test PSB extensively as an encoder within an auto-encoding framework
  paired with a wide variety of decoder options. Compared to the state-of-the-art,
  our architecture demonstrates stable training on longer sequences, achieves parallelization
  that results in a 60% increase in training speed, and yields performance that is
  on par with or better on unsupervised 2D and 3D object-centric scene decomposition
  and understanding.
