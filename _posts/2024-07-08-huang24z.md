title: 'How Universal Polynomial Bases Enhance Spectral Graph Neural Networks: Heterophily,
  Over-smoothing, and Over-squashing'
openreview: Z2LH6Va7L2
abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), alternatively known as <em>graph
  filters</em>, have gained increasing prevalence for heterophily graphs. Optimal
  graph filters rely on Laplacian eigendecomposition for Fourier transform. In an
  attempt to avert prohibitive computations, numerous polynomial filters have been
  proposed. However, polynomials in the majority of these filters are <em>predefined</em>
  and remain <em>fixed</em> across different graphs, failing to accommodate the varying
  degrees of heterophily. Addressing this gap, we demystify the intrinsic correlation
  between the spectral property of desired polynomial bases and the heterophily degrees
  via thorough theoretical analyses. Subsequently, we develop a novel adaptive heterophily
  basis wherein the basis vectors mutually form angles reflecting the heterophily
  degree of the graph. We integrate this heterophily basis with the homophily basis
  to construct a universal polynomial basis <em>UniBasis</em>, which devises a polynomial
  filter based graph neural network â€“ <em>UniFilter</em>. It optimizes the convolution
  and propagation in GNN, thus effectively limiting over-smoothing and alleviating
  over-squashing. Our extensive experiments, conducted on datasets with a diverse
  range of heterophily, support the superiority of UniBasis in the universality but
  also its proficiency in graph explanation.
