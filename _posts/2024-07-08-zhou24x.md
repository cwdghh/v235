title: 'Score identity Distillation: Exponentially Fast Distillation of Pretrained
  Diffusion Models for One-Step Generation'
openreview: QhqQJqe0Wq
abstract: We introduce Score identity Distillation (SiD), an innovative data-free
  method that distills the generative capabilities of pretrained diffusion models
  into a single-step generator. SiD not only facilitates an exponentially fast reduction
  in Fr√©chet inception distance (FID) during distillation but also approaches or even
  exceeds the FID performance of the original teacher diffusion models. By reformulating
  forward diffusion processes as semi-implicit distributions, we leverage three score-related
  identities to create an innovative loss mechanism. This mechanism achieves rapid
  FID reduction by training the generator using its own synthesized images, eliminating
  the need for real data or reverse-diffusion-based generation, all accomplished within
  significantly shortened generation time. Upon evaluation across four benchmark datasets,
  the SiD algorithm demonstrates high iteration efficiency during distillation and
  surpasses competing distillation approaches, whether they are one-step or few-step,
  data-free, or dependent on training data, in terms of generation quality. This achievement
  not only redefines the benchmarks for efficiency and effectiveness in diffusion
  distillation but also in the broader field of diffusion-based generation. The PyTorch
  implementation is available at https://github.com/mingyuanzhou/SiD.
