title: 'DiffFPR: Diffusion Prior for Oversampled Fourier Phase Retrieval'
openreview: 7E4c2gyP0R
abstract: This paper tackled the challenging Fourier phase retrieval problem, the
  <em>absolute uniqueness</em> of which does not hold. The existence of <em>equivalent
  solution</em> (a.k.a. trivial solution ambiguity) hinders the successful recovery,
  especially for multi-channel color image. The traditional iterative engine, such
  as the Relaxed Averaged Alternating Reflections (RAAR), can be applied to reconstruct
  the image channel-wisely. However, due to the <em>relative uniqueness</em> of the
  solution, the restoration is not automatically aligned with the accurate orientation
  for each channel, resulting in a reconstructed image that deviates significantly
  from the true solution manifold. To address this issue, by penalizing the mismatch
  of the image channels, a diffusion model as the strong prior of the color image
  is integrated into the iterative engine. The combination of the traditional iterative
  engine and the diffusion model provides an effective solution to the oversampled
  Fourier phase retrieval. The formed algorithm, <em>DiffFPR</em>, is validated by
  experiments. The code is available at https://github.com/Chilie/DiffFPR.
