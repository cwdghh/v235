title: Learning to Infer Generative Template Programs for Visual Concepts
openreview: ttaTyweIr1
abstract: 'People grasp flexible visual concepts from a few examples. We explore a
  neurosymbolic system that learns how to infer programs that capture visual concepts
  in a domain-general fashion. We introduce Template Programs: programmatic expressions
  from a domain-specific language that specify structural and parametric patterns
  common to an input concept. Our framework supports multiple concept-related tasks,
  including few-shot generation and co-segmentation through parsing. We develop a
  learning paradigm that allows us to train networks that infer Template Programs
  directly from visual datasets that contain concept groupings. We run experiments
  across multiple visual domains: 2D layouts, Omniglot characters, and 3D shapes.
  We find that our method outperforms task-specific alternatives, and performs competitively
  against domain-specific approaches for the limited domains where they exist.'
