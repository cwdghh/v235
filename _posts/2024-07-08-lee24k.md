title: Graph Neural Networks with a Distribution of Parametrized Graphs
openreview: VyfEv6EjKR
abstract: Traditionally, graph neural networks have been trained using a single observed
  graph. However, the observed graph represents only one possible realization. In
  many applications, the graph may encounter uncertainties, such as having erroneous
  or missing edges, as well as edge weights that provide little informative value.
  To address these challenges and capture additional information previously absent
  in the observed graph, we introduce latent variables to parameterize and generate
  multiple graphs. The parameters follow an unknown distribution to be estimated.
  We propose a formulation in terms of maximum likelihood estimation of the network
  parameters. Therefore, it is possible to devise an algorithm based on Expectation-Maximization
  (EM). Specifically, we iteratively determine the distribution of the graphs using
  a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, incorporating the principles of PAC-Bayesian
  theory. Numerical experiments demonstrate improvements in performance against baseline
  models on node classification for both heterogeneous and homogeneous graphs.
