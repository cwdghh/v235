title: A Unified Framework for Learning with Nonlinear Model Classes from Arbitrary
  Linear Samples
openreview: wG2SgnH6Zv
abstract: This work considers the fundamental problem of learning an unknown object
  from training data using a given model class. We introduce a framework that allows
  for objects in arbitrary Hilbert spaces, general types of (random) linear measurements
  as training data and general types of nonlinear model classes. We establish a series
  of learning guarantees for this framework, which provide explicit relations between
  the amount of training data and the model class to ensure near-best generalization
  bounds. In doing so, we introduce the key notion of the <em>variation</em> of a
  model class with respect to a distribution of sampling operators. We show that this
  framework can accommodate many different types of well-known problems of interest,
  such as matrix sketching by random sampling, compressed sensing with isotropic vectors,
  active learning in regression and compressed sensing with generative models. In
  all cases, known results become straightforward corollaries of our general theory.
  Hence, this work provides a powerful framework for studying and analyzing many different
  types of learning problems.
