title: 'Hierarchical Integral Probability Metrics: A distance on random probability
  measures with low sample complexity'
openreview: cmy38XZlJu
abstract: Random probabilities are a key component to many nonparametric methods in
  Statistics and Machine Learning. To quantify comparisons between different laws
  of random probabilities several works are starting to use the elegant Wasserstein
  over Wasserstein distance. In this paper we prove that the infinite dimensionality
  of the space of probabilities drastically deteriorates its sample complexity, which
  is slower than any polynomial rate in the sample size. We propose a new distance
  that preserves many desirable properties of the former while achieving a parametric
  rate of convergence. In particular, our distance 1) metrizes weak convergence; 2)
  can be estimated numerically through samples with low complexity; 3) can be bounded
  analytically from above and below. The main ingredient are integral probability
  metrics, which lead to the name <em>hierarchical IPM</em>.
