title: 'UPOCR: Towards Unified Pixel-Level OCR Interface'
openreview: rEZ24oJhbn
abstract: Existing optical character recognition (OCR) methods rely on task-specific
  designs with divergent paradigms, architectures, and training strategies, which
  significantly increases the complexity of research and maintenance and hinders the
  fast deployment in applications. To this end, we propose UPOCR, a simple-yet-effective
  generalist model for Unified Pixel-level OCR interface. Specifically, the UPOCR
  unifies the paradigm of diverse OCR tasks as image-to-image transformation and the
  architecture as a vision Transformer (ViT)-based encoder-decoder with learnable
  task prompts. The prompts push the general feature representations extracted by
  the encoder towards task-specific spaces, endowing the decoder with task awareness.
  Moreover, the model training is uniformly aimed at minimizing the discrepancy between
  the predicted and ground-truth images regardless of the inhomogeneity among tasks.
  Experiments are conducted on three pixel-level OCR tasks including text removal,
  text segmentation, and tampered text detection. Without bells and whistles, the
  experimental results showcase that the proposed method can simultaneously achieve
  state-of-the-art performance on three tasks with a unified single model, which provides
  valuable strategies and insights for future research on generalist OCR models. Code
