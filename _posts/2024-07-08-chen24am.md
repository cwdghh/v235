title: Self-Attention through Kernel-Eigen Pair Sparse Variational Gaussian Processes
openreview: 4RqG4K5UwL
abstract: While the great capability of Transformers significantly boosts prediction
  accuracy, it could also yield overconfident predictions and require calibrated uncertainty
  estimation, which can be commonly tackled by Gaussian processes (GPs). Existing
  works apply GPs with symmetric kernels under variational inference to the attention
  kernel; however, omitting the fact that attention kernels are in essence asymmetric.
  Moreover, the complexity of deriving the GP posteriors remains high for large-scale
  data. In this work, we propose Kernel-Eigen Pair Sparse Variational Gaussian Processes
  (KEP-SVGP) for building uncertainty-aware self-attention where the asymmetry of
  attention kernels is tackled by Kernel SVD (KSVD) and a reduced complexity is acquired.
  Through KEP-SVGP, i) the SVGP pair induced by the two sets of singular vectors from
  KSVD w.r.t. the attention kernel fully characterizes the asymmetry; ii) using only
  a small set of adjoint eigenfunctions from KSVD, the derivation of SVGP posteriors
  can be based on the inversion of a diagonal matrix containing singular values, contributing
  to a reduction in time complexity; iii) an evidence lower bound is derived so that
  variational parameters and network weights can be optimized with it. Experiments
  verify our excellent performances and efficiency on in-distribution, distribution-shift
  and out-of-distribution benchmarks.
