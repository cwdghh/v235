title: 'Stealthy Imitation: Reward-guided Environment-free Policy Stealing'
openreview: H5FDHzrWe2
abstract: Deep reinforcement learning policies, which are integral to modern control
  systems, represent valuable intellectual property. The development of these policies
  demands considerable resources, such as domain expertise, simulation fidelity, and
  real-world validation. These policies are potentially vulnerable to model stealing
  attacks, which aim to replicate their functionality using only black-box access.
  In this paper, we propose Stealthy Imitation, the first attack designed to steal
  policies without access to the environment or knowledge of the input range. This
  setup has not been considered by previous model stealing methods. Lacking access
  to the victimâ€™s input states distribution, Stealthy Imitation fits a reward model
  that allows to approximate it. We show that the victim policy is harder to imitate
  when the distribution of the attack queries matches that of the victim. We evaluate
  our approach across diverse, high-dimensional control tasks and consistently outperform
  prior data-free approaches adapted for policy stealing. Lastly, we propose a countermeasure
  that significantly diminishes the effectiveness of the attack.
