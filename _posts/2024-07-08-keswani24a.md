title: 'Fair Classification with Partial Feedback: An Exploration-Based Data Collection
  Approach'
openreview: XSsoggg8pz
abstract: In many predictive contexts (e.g., credit lending), true outcomes are only
  observed for samples that were positively classified in the past. These past observations,
  in turn, form training datasets for classifiers that make future predictions. However,
  such training datasets lack information about the outcomes of samples that were
  (incorrectly) negatively classified in the past and can lead to erroneous classifiers.
  We present an approach that trains a classifier using available data and comes with
  a family of exploration strategies to collect outcome data about subpopulations
  that otherwise would have been ignored. For any exploration strategy, the approach
  comes with guarantees that (1) all sub-populations are explored, (2) the fraction
  of false positives is bounded, and (3) the trained classifier converges to a "desired"
  classifier. The right exploration strategy is context-dependent; it can be chosen
  to improve learning guarantees and encode context-specific group fairness properties.
  Evaluation on real-world datasets shows that this approach consistently boosts the
  quality of collected outcome data and improves the fraction of true positives for
  all groups, with only a small reduction in predictive utility.
