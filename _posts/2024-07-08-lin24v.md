title: 'Layer-Aware Analysis of Catastrophic Overfitting: Revealing the Pseudo-Robust
  Shortcut Dependency'
openreview: m8lCi7rG4u
abstract: Catastrophic overfitting (CO) presents a significant challenge in single-step
  adversarial training (AT), manifesting as highly distorted deep neural networks
  (DNNs) that are vulnerable to multi-step adversarial attacks. However, the underlying
  factors that lead to the distortion of decision boundaries remain unclear. In this
  work, we delve into the specific changes within different DNN layers and discover
  that during CO, the former layers are more susceptible, experiencing earlier and
  greater distortion, while the latter layers show relative insensitivity. Our analysis
  further reveals that this increased sensitivity in former layers stems from the
  formation of $\textit{pseudo-robust shortcuts}$, which alone can impeccably defend
  against single-step adversarial attacks but bypass genuine-robust learning, resulting
  in distorted decision boundaries. Eliminating these shortcuts can partially restore
  robustness in DNNs from the CO state, thereby verifying that dependence on them
  triggers the occurrence of CO. This understanding motivates us to implement adaptive
  weight perturbations across different layers to hinder the generation of $\textit{pseudo-robust
  shortcuts}$, consequently mitigating CO. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
  our proposed method, $\textbf{L}$ayer-$\textbf{A}$ware Adversarial Weight $\textbf{P}$erturbation
  (LAP), can effectively prevent CO and further enhance robustness.
