title: AlphaZero-Like Tree-Search can Guide Large Language Model Decoding and Training
openreview: C4OpREezgj
abstract: Recent works like Tree-of-Thought (ToT) and Reasoning via Planning (RAP)
  aim to augment the multi-step reasoning capabilities of LLMs by using tree-search
  algorithms. These methods rely on prompting a pre-trained model to serve as a value
  function and focus on problems with low search depth. As a result, these methods
  cannot benefit from in-domain training and only rely on pretraining process â€” they
  will not work in domains where the pre-trained LLM does not have enough knowledge
  to serve as an effective value function or in domains that require long-horizon
  planning. To address these limitations, we present an AlphaZero-like tree-search
  learning framework for LLMs (termed TS-LLM), systematically illustrating how tree-search
  with a learned value function can guide LLM decoding. TS-LLM distinguishes itself
  in two key ways. (1) Leveraging a learned value function and AlphaZero-like algorithms,
  our approach can be generally adaptable to a wide range of tasks, language models
  of any size, and tasks of varying search depths. (2) Our approach can guide LLMs
  during both inference and training, iteratively improving the LLMs. Empirical results
  across reasoning, planning, alignment, and decision-making tasks show that TS-LLM
  outperforms existing approaches and can handle trees with a depth of 64.
