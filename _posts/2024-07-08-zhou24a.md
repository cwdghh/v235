title: Jacobian Regularizer-based Neural Granger Causality
openreview: FG5hjRBtpm
abstract: With the advancement of neural networks, diverse methods for neural Granger
  causality have emerged, which demonstrate proficiency in handling complex data,
  and nonlinear relationships. However, the existing framework of neural Granger causality
  has several limitations. It requires the construction of separate predictive models
  for each target variable, and the relationship depends on the sparsity on the weights
  of the first layer, resulting in challenges in effectively modeling complex relationships
  between variables as well as unsatisfied estimation accuracy of Granger causality.
  Moreover, most of them cannot grasp full-time Granger causality. To address these
  drawbacks, we propose a <b>J</b>acobian <b>R</b>egularizer-based <b>N</b>eural <b>G</b>ranger
  <b>C</b>ausality (<b>JRNGC</b>) approach, a straightforward yet highly effective
  method for learning multivariate summary Granger causality and full-time Granger
  causality by constructing a single model for all target variables. Specifically,
  our method eliminates the sparsity constraints of weights by leveraging an input-output
  Jacobian matrix regularizer, which can be subsequently represented as the weighted
  causal matrix in the post-hoc analysis. Extensive experiments show that our proposed
  approach achieves competitive performance with the state-of-the-art methods for
  learning summary Granger causality and full-time Granger causality while maintaining
  lower model complexity and high scalability.
