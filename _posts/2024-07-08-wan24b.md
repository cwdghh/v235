title: 'SeMOPO: Learning High-quality Model and Policy from Low-quality Offline Visual
  Datasets'
openreview: ZtOXZCTgBa
abstract: Model-based offline reinforcement Learning (RL) is a promising approach
  that leverages existing data effectively in many real-world applications, especially
  those involving high-dimensional inputs like images and videos. To alleviate the
  distribution shift issue in offline RL, existing model-based methods heavily rely
  on the uncertainty of learned dynamics. However, the model uncertainty estimation
  becomes significantly biased when observations contain complex distractors with
  non-trivial dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a new approach - <em>Separated
  Model-based Offline Policy Optimization</em> (SeMOPO) - decomposing latent states
  into endogenous and exogenous parts via conservative sampling and estimating model
  uncertainty on the endogenous states only. We provide a theoretical guarantee of
  model uncertainty and performance bound of SeMOPO. To assess the efficacy, we construct
  the Low-Quality Vision Deep Data-Driven Datasets for RL (LQV-D4RL), where the data
  are collected by non-expert policy and the observations include moving distractors.
  Experimental results show that our method substantially outperforms all baseline
  methods, and further analytical experiments validate the critical designs in our
  method. The project website is https://sites.google.com/view/semopo.
