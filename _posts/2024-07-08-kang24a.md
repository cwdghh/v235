title: 'C-RAG: Certified Generation Risks for Retrieval-Augmented Language Models'
openreview: FMa4c5NhOe
abstract: 'Despite the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs) across
  diverse applications, they still suffer from trustworthiness issues, such as hallucinations
  and misalignments. Retrieval-augmented language models (RAG) have been proposed
  to enhance the credibility of generations by grounding external knowledge, but the
  theoretical understandings of their generation risks remains unexplored. In this
  paper, we answer: 1) whether RAG can indeed lead to low generation risks, 2) how
  to provide provable guarantees on the generation risks of RAG and vanilla LLMs,
  and 3) what sufficient conditions enable RAG models to reduce generation risks.
  We propose C-RAG, the first framework to certify generation risks for RAG models.
  Specifically, we provide conformal risk analysis for RAG models and certify an upper
  confidence bound of generation risks, which we refer to as conformal generation
  risk. We also provide theoretical guarantees on conformal generation risks for general
  bounded risk functions under test distribution shifts. We prove that RAG achieves
  a lower conformal generation risk than that of a single LLM when the quality of
  the retrieval model and transformer is non-trivial. Our intensive empirical results
  demonstrate the soundness and tightness of our conformal generation risk guarantees
  across four widely-used NLP datasets on four state-of-the-art retrieval models.'
