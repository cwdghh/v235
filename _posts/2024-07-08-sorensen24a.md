title: 'Position: A Roadmap to Pluralistic Alignment'
openreview: gQpBnRHwxM
abstract: 'With increased power and prevalence of AI systems, it is ever more critical
  that AI systems are designed to serve <em>all</em>, i.e., people with diverse values
  and perspectives. However, aligning models to serve <em>pluralistic</em> human values
  remains an open research question. In this piece, we propose a roadmap to pluralistic
  alignment, specifically using large language models as a test bed. We identify and
  formalize three possible ways to define and operationalize pluralism in AI systems:
  1) <em>Overton pluralistic</em> models that present a spectrum of reasonable responses;
  2) <em>Steerably pluralistic</em> models that can steer to reflect certain perspectives;
  and 3) <em>Distributionally pluralistic</em> models that are well-calibrated to
  a given population in distribution. We also formalize and discuss three possible
  classes of <em>pluralistic benchmarks</em>: 1) <em>Multi-objective</em> benchmarks,
  2) <em>Trade-off steerable</em> benchmarks that incentivize models to steer to arbitrary
  trade-offs, and 3) <em>Jury-pluralistic</em> benchmarks that explicitly model diverse
  human ratings. We use this framework to argue that current alignment techniques
  may be fundamentally limited for pluralistic AI; indeed, we highlight empirical
  evidence, both from our own experiments and from other work, that standard alignment
  procedures might <em>reduce</em> distributional pluralism in models, motivating
  the need for further research on pluralistic alignment.'
