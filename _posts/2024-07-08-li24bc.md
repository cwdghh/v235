title: 'The WMDP Benchmark: Measuring and Reducing Malicious Use with Unlearning'
openreview: xlr6AUDuJz
abstract: The White House Executive Order on Artificial Intelligence highlights the
  risks of large language models (LLMs) empowering malicious actors in developing
  biological, cyber, and chemical weapons. To measure these risks, government institutions
  and major AI labs are developing evaluations for hazardous capabilities in LLMs.
  However, current evaluations are private and restricted to a narrow range of malicious
  use scenarios, which limits further research into reducing malicious use. To fill
  these gaps, we release the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) benchmark, a
  dataset of 3,668 multiple-choice questions that serve as a proxy measurement of
  hazardous knowledge in biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemical security. To guide
  progress on unlearning, we develop RMU, a state-of-the-art unlearning method based
  on controlling model representations. RMU reduces model performance on WMDP while
  maintaining general capabilities in areas such as biology and computer science,
  suggesting that unlearning may be a concrete path towards reducing malicious use
  from LLMs. We release our benchmark and code publicly at https://wmdp.ai.
