title: Regression Learning with Limited Observations of Multivariate Outcomes and
  Features
openreview: 3nlBesNxcm
abstract: Multivariate linear regression models are broadly used to facilitate relationships
  between outcomes and features. However, their effectiveness is compromised by the
  presence of missing observations, a ubiquitous challenge in real-world applications.
  Considering a scenario where learners access only limited components for both outcomes
  and features, we develop efficient algorithms tailored for the least squares ($L_2$)
  and least absolute ($L_1$) loss functions, each coupled with a ridge-like and Lasso-type
  penalty, respectively. Moreover, we establish rigorous error bounds for all proposed
  algorithms. Notably, our $L_2$ loss function algorithms are probably approximately
  correct (PAC), distinguishing them from their $L_1$ counterparts. Extensive numerical
  experiments show that our approach outperforms methods that apply existing algorithms
  for univariate outcome individually to each coordinate of multivariate outcomes
  in a naive manner. Further, utilizing the $L_1$ loss function or introducing a Lasso-type
  penalty can enhance predictions in the presence of outliers or high dimensional
  features. This research contributes valuable insights into addressing the challenges
  posed by incomplete data.
