title: 'Repoformer: Selective Retrieval for Repository-Level Code Completion'
openreview: moyG54Okrj
abstract: Recent advances in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have initiated a
  new era in repository-level code completion. However, the invariable use of retrieval
  in existing methods exposes issues in both efficiency and robustness, with a large
  proportion of the retrieved contexts proving unhelpful or harmful to code language
  models (code LMs). In this paper, we propose a selective RAG framework to avoid
  retrieval when unnecessary. To power this framework, we design a self-supervised
  learning approach to enable a code LM to accurately self-evaluate whether retrieval
  can improve its output quality and robustly leverage the potentially noisy retrieved
  contexts. Using this LM as both the selective RAG policy and the generation model,
  our framework achieves state-of-the-art repository-level code completion performance
  on diverse benchmarks including RepoEval, CrossCodeEval, and CrossCodeLongEval,
  a new long-form code completion benchmark. Meanwhile, our analyses show that selectively
  retrieving brings as much as 70% inference speedup in the online serving setting
  without harming the performance. We further demonstrate that our framework is able
  to accommodate different generation models, retrievers, and programming languages.
  These advancements position our framework as an important step towards more accurate
  and efficient repository-level code completion.
