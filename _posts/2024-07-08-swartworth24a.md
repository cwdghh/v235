title: Fast Sampling-Based Sketches for Tensors
openreview: tMkPL7Tiul
abstract: We introduce a new approach for applying sampling-based sketches to two
  and three mode tensors. We illustrate our technique to construct sketches for the
  classical problems of $\ell_0$ sampling and producing $\ell_1$ embeddings. In both
  settings we achieve sketches that can be applied to a rank one tensor in $(\mathbb{R}^d)^{\otimes
  q}$ (for $q=2,3$) in time scaling with $d$ rather than $d^2$ or $d^3$. Our main
  idea is a particular sampling construction based on fast convolution which allows
  us to quickly compute sums over sufficiently random subsets of tensor entries.
