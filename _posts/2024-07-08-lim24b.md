title: Momentum Particle Maximum Likelihood
openreview: ngjmcfowtc
abstract: Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of latent variable models is often recast
  as the minimization of a free energy functional over an extended space of parameters
  and probability distributions. This perspective was recently combined with insights
  from optimal transport to obtain novel particle-based algorithms for fitting latent
  variable models to data. Drawing inspiration from prior works which interpret ‘momentum-enriched’
  optimization algorithms as discretizations of ordinary differential equations, we
  propose an analogous dynamical-systems-inspired approach to minimizing the free
  energy functional. The result is a dynamical system that blends elements of Nesterov’s
  Accelerated Gradient method, the underdamped Langevin diffusion, and particle methods.
  Under suitable assumptions, we prove that the continuous-time system minimizes the
  functional. By discretizing the system, we obtain a practical algorithm for MLE
  in latent variable models. The algorithm outperforms existing particle methods in
  numerical experiments and compares favourably with other MLE algorithms.
