title: 'NDOT: Neuronal Dynamics-based Online Training for Spiking Neural Networks'
openreview: elF0QoBSFV
abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are attracting great attention for their
  energy-efficient and fast-inference properties in neuromorphic computing. However,
  the efficient training of deep SNNs poses challenges in gradient calculation due
  to the non-differentiability of their binary spike-generating activation functions.
  The widely used surrogate gradient (SG) method, combined with the back-propagation
  through time (BPTT), has shown considerable effectiveness. Yet, BPTT’s process of
  unfolding and back-propagating along the computation graph requires storing intermediate
  information at all time-steps, resulting in huge memory consumption and failing
  to meet online requirements. In this work, we propose Neuronal Dynamics-based Online
  Training (NDOT) for SNNs, which uses the neuronal dynamics-based temporal dependency/sensitivity
  in gradient computation. NDOT enables forward-in-time learning by decomposing the
  full gradient into temporal and spatial gradients. To illustrate the intuition behind
  NDOT, we employ the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) algorithm. FTRL explicitly
  utilizes historical information and addresses limitations in instantaneous loss.
  Our proposed NDOT method accurately captures temporal dependencies through neuronal
  dynamics, functioning similarly to FTRL’s explicit utilizing historical information.
  Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CIFAR10-DVS demonstrate the superior performance
  of our NDOT method on large-scale static and neuromorphic datasets within a small
  number of time steps. The codes are available at https://github.com/HaiyanJiang/SNN-NDOT.
