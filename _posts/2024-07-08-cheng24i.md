title: Can AI Assistants Know What They Don’t Know?
openreview: girxGkdECL
abstract: AI assistants powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
  impressive performance in various tasks. However, LLMs still make factual errors
  in knowledge-intensive tasks such as open-domain question answering. These untruthful
  responses from AI assistants can pose significant risks in practical applications.
  Therefore, in this paper, we ask the question <b>Can AI assistants know what they
  don’t know and express this awareness through natural language?</b> To investigate
  this, we construct a model-specific "I don’t know" (Idk) dataset. This dataset includes
  Supervised Fine-tuning data and preference data, categorizing questions based on
  whether the assistant knows or does not know the answers. Then, we align the assistant
  with its corresponding Idk dataset using different alignment methods, including
  Supervised Fine-tuning and preference optimization. Experimental results show that,
  after alignment with the Idk dataset, the assistant is more capable of declining
  to answer questions outside its knowledge scope. The assistant aligned with the
  Idk dataset shows significantly higher truthfulness than the original assistant.
