title: 'TENG: Time-Evolving Natural Gradient for Solving PDEs With Deep Neural Nets
  Toward Machine Precision'
openreview: v1I4zRAjMb
abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are instrumental for modeling dynamical
  systems in science and engineering. The advent of neural networks has initiated
  a significant shift in tackling these complexities though challenges in accuracy
  persist, especially for initial value problems. In this paper, we introduce the
  <em>Time-Evolving Natural Gradient (TENG)</em>, generalizing time-dependent variational
  principles and optimization-based time integration, leveraging natural gradient
  optimization to obtain high accuracy in neural-network-based PDE solutions. Our
  comprehensive development includes algorithms like TENG-Euler and its high-order
  variants, such as TENG-Heun, tailored for enhanced precision and efficiency. TENG’s
  effectiveness is further validated through its performance, surpassing current leading
  methods and achieving <em>machine precision</em> in step-by-step optimizations across
  a spectrum of PDEs, including the heat equation, Allen-Cahn equation, and Burgers’
  equation.
