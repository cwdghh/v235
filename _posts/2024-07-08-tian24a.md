title: Collapse-Aware Triplet Decoupling for Adversarially Robust Image Retrieval
openreview: cy3JBZKCw1
abstract: 'Adversarial training has achieved substantial performance in defending
  image retrieval against adversarial examples. However, existing studies in deep
  metric learning (DML) still suffer from two major limitations: <em>weak adversary</em>
  and <em>model collapse</em>. In this paper, we address these two limitations by
  proposing <b>C</b>ollapse-<b>A</b>ware <b>TRI</b>plet <b>DE</b>coupling (<b>CA-TRIDE</b>).
  Specifically, TRIDE yields a stronger adversary by spatially decoupling the perturbation
  targets into the anchor and the other candidates. Furthermore, CA prevents the consequential
  model collapse, based on a novel metric, collapseness, which is incorporated into
  the optimization of perturbation. We also identify two drawbacks of the existing
  robustness metric in image retrieval and propose a new metric for a more reasonable
  robustness evaluation. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that
  CA-TRIDE outperforms existing defense methods in both conventional and new metrics.
