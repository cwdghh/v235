title: 'Memoria: Resolving Fateful Forgetting Problem through Human-Inspired Memory
  Architecture'
openreview: yTz0u4B8ug
abstract: Making neural networks remember over the long term has been a longstanding
  issue. Although several external memory techniques have been introduced, most focus
  on retaining recent information in the short term. Regardless of its importance,
  information tends to be fatefully forgotten over time. We present Memoria, a memory
  system for artificial neural networks, drawing inspiration from humans and applying
  various neuroscientific and psychological theories. The experimental results prove
  the effectiveness of Memoria in the diverse tasks of sorting, language modeling,
  and classification, surpassing conventional techniques. Engram analysis reveals
  that Memoria exhibits the primacy, recency, and temporal contiguity effects which
  are characteristics of human memory.
