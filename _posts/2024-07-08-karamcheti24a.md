title: 'Prismatic VLMs: Investigating the Design Space of Visually-Conditioned Language
  Models'
openreview: 6FXtu8clyp
abstract: 'Visually-conditioned language models (VLMs) have seen growing adoption
  in applications such as visual dialogue, scene understanding, and robotic task planning;
  adoption that has fueled a wealth of new models such as LLaVa, InstructBLIP, and
  PaLI-3. Despite the volume of new releases, key design decisions around image preprocessing,
  architecture, and optimization are under-explored, making it challenging to understand
  what factors account for model performance â€“ a challenge further complicated by
  the lack of objective, consistent evaluations. To address these gaps, we first compile
  a suite of standardized evaluations spanning visual question answering, object localization,
  and challenge sets that probe properties such as hallucination; evaluations that
  provide fine-grained insight VLM capabilities. Second, we rigorously investigate
  VLMs along key design axes, including pretrained visual representations and training
  from base vs. instruct-tuned language models, amongst others. We couple our analysis
  with three resource contributions: (1) a unified framework for evaluating VLMs,
  (2) optimized, flexible training code, and (3) checkpoints for all models, including
  a family of VLMs at the 7-13B scale that strictly outperform InstructBLIP and LLaVa
  v1.5, the state-of-the-art in open VLMs.'
