title: 'WISER: Weak Supervision and Supervised Representation Learning to Improve
  Drug Response Prediction in Cancer'
openreview: 8ySQaphUYH
abstract: Cancer, a leading cause of death globally, occurs due to genomic changes
  and manifests heterogeneously across patients. To advance research on personalized
  treatment strategies, the effectiveness of various drugs on cells derived from cancers
  (’cell lines’) is experimentally determined in laboratory settings. Nevertheless,
  variations in the distribution of genomic data and drug responses between cell lines
  and humans arise due to biological and environmental differences. Moreover, while
  genomic profiles of many cancer patients are readily available, the scarcity of
  corresponding drug response data limits the ability to train machine learning models
  that can predict drug response in patients effectively. Recent cancer drug response
  prediction methods have largely followed the paradigm of unsupervised domain-invariant
  representation learning followed by a downstream drug response classification step.
  Introducing supervision in both stages is challenging due to heterogeneous patient
  response to drugs and limited drug response data. This paper addresses these challenges
  through a novel representation learning method in the first phase and weak supervision
  in the second. Experimental results on real patient data demonstrate the efficacy
  of our method WISER (Weak supervISion and supErvised Representation learning) over
  state-of-the-art alternatives on predicting personalized drug response. Our implementation
  is available at https://github.com/kyrs/WISER
