title: DAG-Based Column Generation for Adversarial Team Games
openreview: 0hbeZQm1Se
abstract: Many works recently have focused on computing optimal solutions for the
  ex ante coordination of a team for solving sequential adversarial team games, where
  a team of players coordinate against an opponent (or a team of players) in a zero-sum
  extensive-form game. However, it is challenging to directly compute such an optimal
  solution because the team’s coordinated strategy space is exponential in the size
  of the game tree due to the asymmetric information of team members. Column Generation
  (CG) algorithms have been proposed to overcome this challenge by iteratively expanding
  the team’s coordinated strategy space via a Best Response Oracle (BRO). More recently,
  more compact representations (particularly, the Team Belief Directed Acyclic Graph
  (TB-DAG)) of the team’s coordinated strategy space have been proposed, but the TB-DAG-based
  algorithms only outperform the CG-based algorithms in games with a small TB-DAG.
  Unfortunately, it is inefficient to directly apply CG to the TB-DAG because the
  size of the TB-DAG is still exponential in the size of the game tree and then makes
  the BRO unscalable. To this end, we develop our novel TB-DAG CG (DCG) algorithm
  framework by computing a coordinated best response in the original game first and
  then transforming this strategy into the TB-DAG form. To further improve the scalability,
  we propose a more suitable BRO for DCG to reduce the cost of the transformation
  at each iteration. We theoretically show that our algorithm converges exponentially
  faster than the state-of-the-art CG algorithms, and experimental results show that
  our algorithm is at least two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art
  baselines.
