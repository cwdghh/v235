title: 'Enhancing Vision Transformer: Amplifying Non-Linearity in Feedforward Network
  Module'
openreview: NV0q2jdwo0
abstract: Transformer models have been gaining substantial interest in the field of
  computer vision tasks nowadays. Although a vision transformer contains two important
  components which are self-attention module and feedforward network (FFN) module,
  the majority of research tends to concentrate on modifying the former while leaving
  the latter in its original form. In this paper, we focus on improving the FFN module
  within the vision transformer. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that
  the effect of the FFN module primarily lies in providing non-linearity, whose degree
  corresponds to the hidden dimensions. Thus, the computational cost of the FFN module
  can be reduced by enhancing the degree of non-linearity in the nonlinear function.
  Leveraging this insight, we propose an improved FFN (IFFN) module for vision transformers
  which involves the usage of the arbitrary GeLU (AGeLU) function and integrating
  multiple instances of it to augment non-linearity so that the number of hidden dimensions
  can be effectively reduced. Besides, a spatial enhancement part is involved to further
  enrich the non-linearity in the proposed IFFN module. Experimental results show
  that we can apply our method to a wide range of state-of-the-art vision transformer
  models irrespective of how they modify their self-attention part and the overall
  architecture, and reduce FLOPs and parameters without compromising classification
  accuracy on the ImageNet dataset.
