title: 'Discovering Bias in Latent Space: An Unsupervised Debiasing Approach'
openreview: dztd61efGy
abstract: The question-answering (QA) capabilities of foundation models are highly
  sensitive to prompt variations, rendering their performance susceptible to superficial,
  non-meaning-altering changes. This vulnerability often stems from the model’s preference
  or bias towards specific input characteristics, such as option position or superficial
  image features in multi-modal settings. We propose to rectify this bias directly
  in the model’s internal representation. Our approach, SteerFair, finds the bias
  direction in the model’s representation space and steers activation values away
  from it during inference. Specifically, we exploit the observation that bias often
  adheres to simple association rules, such as the spurious association between the
  first option and correctness likelihood. Next, we construct demonstrations of these
  rules from unlabeled samples and use them to identify the bias directions. We empirically
  show that SteerFair significantly reduces instruction-tuned model performance variance
  across prompt modifications on three benchmark tasks. Remarkably, our approach surpasses
  a supervised baseline with 100 labels by an average of 10.86% accuracy points and
  12.95 score points and matches the performance with 500 labels.
