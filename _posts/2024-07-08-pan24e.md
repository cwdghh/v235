title: Stability and Generalization for Stochastic Recursive Momentum-based Algorithms
  for (Strongly-)Convex One to $K$-Level Stochastic Optimizations
openreview: DsVzHj7jcA
abstract: 'STOchastic Recursive Momentum (STORM)-based algorithms have been widely
  developed to solve one to $K$-level ($K \geq 3$) stochastic optimization problems.
  Specifically, they use estimators to mitigate the biased gradient issue and achieve
  near-optimal convergence results. However, there is relatively little work on understanding
  their generalization performance, particularly evident during the transition from
  one to $K$-level optimization contexts. This paper provides a comprehensive generalization
  analysis of three representative STORM-based algorithms: STORM, COVER, and SVMR,
  for one, two, and $K$-level stochastic optimizations under both convex and strongly
  convex settings based on algorithmic stability. Firstly, we define stability for
  $K$-level optimizations and link it to generalization. Then, we detail the stability
  results for three prominent STORM-based algorithms. Finally, we derive their excess
  risk bounds by balancing stability results with optimization errors. Our theoretical
  results provide strong evidence to complete STORM-based algorithms: (1) Each estimator
  may decrease their stability due to variance with its estimation target. (2) Every
  additional level might escalate the generalization error, influenced by the stability
  and the variance between its cumulative stochastic gradient and the true gradient.
  (3) Increasing the batch size for the initial computation of estimators presents
  a favorable trade-off, enhancing the generalization performance.'
