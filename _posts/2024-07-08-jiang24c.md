title: 'ProtoGate: Prototype-based Neural Networks with Global-to-local Feature Selection
  for Tabular Biomedical Data'
openreview: 07fSWltF6M
abstract: Tabular biomedical data poses challenges in machine learning because it
  is often high-dimensional and typically low-sample-size (HDLSS). Previous research
  has attempted to address these challenges via local feature selection, but existing
  approaches often fail to achieve optimal performance due to their limitation in
  identifying globally important features and their susceptibility to the co-adaptation
  problem. In this paper, we propose ProtoGate, a prototype-based neural model for
  feature selection on HDLSS data. ProtoGate first selects instance-wise features
  via adaptively balancing global and local feature selection. Furthermore, ProtoGate
  employs a non-parametric prototype-based prediction mechanism to tackle the co-adaptation
  problem, ensuring the feature selection results and predictions are consistent with
  underlying data clusters. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance
  and interpretability of ProtoGate on synthetic and real-world datasets. The results
  show that ProtoGate generally outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction
  accuracy by a clear margin while providing high-fidelity feature selection and explainable
  predictions. Code is available at https://github.com/SilenceX12138/ProtoGate.
