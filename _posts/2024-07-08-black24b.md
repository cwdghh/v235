title: Comparing Graph Transformers via Positional Encodings
openreview: va3r3hSA6n
abstract: 'The distinguishing power of graph transformers is tied to the choice of
  <em>positional encoding</em>: features used to augment the base transformer with
  information about the graph. There are two primary types of positional encoding:
  <em>absolute positional encodings (APEs)</em> and <em>relative positional encodings
  (RPEs)</em>. APEs assign features to each node and are given as input to the transformer.
  RPEs instead assign a feature to each <em>pair of nodes</em>, e.g., shortest-path
  distance, and are used to augment the attention block. A priori, it is unclear which
  method is better for maximizing the power of the resulting graph transformer. In
  this paper, we aim to understand the relationship between these different types
  of positional encodings. Interestingly, we show that graph transformers using APEs
  and RPEs are equivalent in their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs. In
  particular, we demonstrate how to interchange APEs and RPEs while maintaining their
  distinguishing power in terms of graph transformers. However, in the case of graphs
  with node features, we show that RPEs may have an advantage over APEs. Based on
  our theoretical results, we provide a study of different APEs and RPEs—including
  the shortest-path and resistance distance and the recently introduced stable and
  expressive positional encoding (SPE)—and compare their distinguishing power in terms
  of transformers. We believe our work will help navigate the vast number of positional
  encoding choices and provide guidance on the future design of positional encodings
  for graph transformers.'
