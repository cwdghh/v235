title: Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for Contextual Dueling Bandits
openreview: l9ga3iQuHt
abstract: Contextual dueling bandits, where a learner compares two options based on
  context and receives feedback indicating which was preferred, extends classic dueling
  bandits by incorporating contextual information for decision-making and preference
  learning. Several algorithms based on the upper confidence bound (UCB) have been
  proposed for linear contextual dueling bandits. However, no algorithm based on posterior
  sampling has been developed in this setting, despite the empirical success observed
  in traditional contextual bandits. In this paper, we propose a Thompson sampling
  algorithm, named FGTS.CDB, for linear contextual dueling bandits. At the core of
  our algorithm is a new Feel-Good exploration term specifically tailored for dueling
  bandits. This term leverages the independence of the two selected arms, thereby
  avoiding a cross term in the analysis. We show that our algorithm achieves nearly
  minimax-optimal regret, i.e., $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt T)$, where $d$ is the
  model dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm
  on synthetic data and observe that FGTS.CDB outperforms existing algorithms by a
  large margin.
