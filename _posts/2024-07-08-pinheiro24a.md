title: Structure-based drug design by denoising voxel grids
openreview: K3fEkECWgu
abstract: 'We presents VoxBind, a new score-based generative model for 3D molecules
  conditioned on protein structures. Our approach represents molecules as 3D atomic
  density grids and leverages a 3D voxel-denoising network for learning and generation.
  We extend the neural empirical Bayes formalism (Saremi & Hyvärinen, 2019) to the
  conditional setting and generate structure-conditioned molecules with a two-step
  procedure: (i) sample noisy molecules from the Gaussian-smoothed conditional distribution
  with underdamped Langevin MCMC using the learned score function and (ii) estimate
  clean molecules from the noisy samples with single-step denoising. Compared to the
  current state of the art, our model is simpler to train, significantly faster to
  sample from, and achieves better results on extensive in silico benchmarks—the generated
  molecules are more diverse, exhibit fewer steric clashes, and bind with higher affinity
  to protein pockets.'
