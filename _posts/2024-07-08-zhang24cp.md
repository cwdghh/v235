title: Fast Text-to-3D-Aware Face Generation and Manipulation via Direct Cross-modal
  Mapping and Geometric Regularization
openreview: 4boDu42RtE
abstract: Text-to-3D-aware face (T3D Face) generation and manipulation is an emerging
  research hot spot in machine learning, which still suffers from low efficiency and
  poor quality. In this paper, we propose an <b><em>E</em>*nd-to-End </b>E<b>fficient
  and </b>E<em><em>ffective</em> network for fast and accurate T3D face generation
  and manipulation, termed $E^3$-FaceNet. Different from existing complex generation
  paradigms, $E^3$-FaceNet resorts to a direct mapping from text instructions to 3D-aware
  visual space. We introduce a novel </em>Style Code Enhancer<em> to enhance cross-modal
  semantic alignment, alongside an innovative </em>Geometric Regularization* objective
  to maintain consistency across multi-view generations. Extensive experiments on
  three benchmark datasets demonstrate that $E^3$-FaceNet can not only achieve picture-like
  3D face generation and manipulation, but also improve inference speed by orders
  of magnitudes. For instance, compared with Latent3D, $E^3$-FaceNet speeds up the
  five-view generations by almost 470 times, while still exceeding in generation quality.
