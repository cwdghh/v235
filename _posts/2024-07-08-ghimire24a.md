title: State-Constrained Zero-Sum Differential Games with One-Sided Information
openreview: bcN7KSB2YS
abstract: We study zero-sum differential games with state constraints and one-sided
  information, where the informed player (Player 1) has a categorical payoff type
  unknown to the uninformed player (Player 2). The goal of Player 1 is to minimize
  his payoff without violating the constraints, while that of Player 2 is to violate
  the state constraints if possible, or to maximize the payoff otherwise. One example
  of the game is a man-to-man matchup in football. Without state constraints, Cardaliaguet
  (2007) showed that the value of such a game exists and is convex to the common belief
  of players. Our theoretical contribution is an extension of this result to games
  with state constraints and the derivation of the primal and dual subdynamic principles
  necessary for computing behavioral strategies. Different from existing works that
  are concerned about the scalability of no-regret learning in games with discrete
  dynamics, our study reveals the underlying structure of strategies for belief manipulation
  resulting from information asymmetry and state constraints. This structure will
  be necessary for scalable learning on games with continuous actions and long time
  windows. We use a simplified football game to demonstrate the utility of this work,
  where we reveal player positions and belief states in which the attacker should
  (or should not) play specific random deceptive moves to take advantage of information
  asymmetry, and compute how the defender should respond.
