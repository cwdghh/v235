title: From Generalization Analysis to Optimization Designs for State Space Models
openreview: WjNzXeiOSL
abstract: A State Space Model (SSM) is a foundation model in time series analysis,
  which has recently been shown as an alternative to transformers in sequence modeling.
  In this paper, we theoretically study the generalization of SSMs and propose improvements
  to training algorithms based on the generalization results. Specifically, we give
  a <em>data-dependent</em> generalization bound for SSMs, showing an interplay between
  the SSM parameters and the temporal dependencies of the training sequences. Leveraging
  the generalization bound, we (1) set up a scaling rule for model initialization
  based on the proposed generalization measure, which significantly improves the robustness
  of the output value scales on SSMs to different temporal patterns in the sequence
  data; (2) introduce a new regularization method for training SSMs to enhance the
  generalization performance. Numerical results are conducted to validate our results.
