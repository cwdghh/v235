title: 'IIANet: An Intra- and Inter-Modality Attention Network for Audio-Visual Speech
  Separation'
openreview: FM61SQzF3N
abstract: 'Recent research has made significant progress in designing fusion modules
  for audio-visual speech separation. However, they predominantly focus on multi-modal
  fusion at a single temporal scale of auditory and visual features without employing
  selective attention mechanisms, which is in sharp contrast with the brain. To address
  this, We propose a novel model called intra- and inter-attention network (IIANet),
  which leverages the attention mechanism for efficient audio-visual feature fusion.
  IIANet consists of two types of attention blocks: intra-attention (IntraA) and inter-attention
  (InterA) blocks, where the InterA blocks are distributed at the top, middle and
  bottom of IIANet. Heavily inspired by the way how human brain selectively focuses
  on relevant content at various temporal scales, these blocks maintain the ability
  to learn modality-specific features and enable the extraction of different semantics
  from audio-visual features. Comprehensive experiments on three standard audio-visual
  separation benchmarks (LRS2, LRS3, and VoxCeleb2) demonstrate the effectiveness
  of IIANet, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods while maintaining comparable
  inference time. In particular, the fast version of IIANet (IIANet-fast) has only
  7% of CTCNetâ€™s MACs and is 40% faster than CTCNet on CPUs while achieving better
  separation quality, showing the great potential of attention mechanism for efficient
  and effective multimodal fusion.'
