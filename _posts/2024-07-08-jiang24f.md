title: 'HexGen: Generative Inference of Large Language Model over Heterogeneous Environment'
openreview: 9ANyvRtFGa
abstract: Serving generative inference of the large language model is a crucial component
  of contemporary AI applications. In this paper, our focus lies in deploying such
  services in a heterogeneous and cross-datacenter setting to mitigate the substantial
  inference costs typically associated with a single centralized datacenter. Towards
  this end, we propose HexGen, a flexible distributed inference engine that uniquely
  supports the asymmetric partition of generative inference computations over both
  tensor model parallelism and pipeline parallelism, which allows for effective deployment
  across diverse GPUs interconnected by a fully heterogeneous network. We further
  propose a sophisticated scheduling algorithm grounded in constrained optimization
  that can adaptively assign asymmetric inference computation across the GPUs to fulfill
  inference requests while maintaining acceptable latency levels. We conduct an extensive
  empirical study to evaluate the efficiency of HexGen by serving the state-of-the-art
  Llama-2 (70B) model. The experimental results suggest that HexGen can choose to
  achieve up to $2.3\times$ lower latency deadlines or tolerate up to $4\times$ more
  traffic request rates compared with the homogeneous baseline given the same budget.
