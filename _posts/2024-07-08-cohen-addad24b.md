title: Multi-View Stochastic Block Models
openreview: BJx1K4lAAX
abstract: Graph clustering is a central topic in unsupervised learning with a multitude
  of practical applications. In recent years, multi-view graph clustering has gained
  a lot of attention for its applicability to real-world instances where one often
  has access to multiple data sources. In this paper we formalize a new family of
  models, called <em>multi-view stochastic block models</em> that capture this setting.
  For this model, we first study efficient algorithms that naively work on the union
  of multiple graphs. Then, we introduce a new efficient algorithm that provably outperforms
  previous approaches by analyzing the structure of each graph separately. Finally,
  we complement our results with an information-theoretic lower bound studying the
  limits of what can be done in this model.
