title: 'Probabilistic Conceptual Explainers: Trustworthy Conceptual Explanations for
  Vision Foundation Models'
openreview: Cw6Xl0g8a5
abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a significant area of focus,
  particularly for their capacity to be jointly trained with large language models
  and to serve as robust vision foundation models. Yet, the development of trustworthy
  explanation methods for ViTs has lagged, particularly in the context of post-hoc
  interpretations of ViT predictions. Existing sub-image selection approaches, such
  as feature-attribution and conceptual models, fall short in this regard. This paper
  proposes five desiderata for explaining ViTs – faithfulness, stability, sparsity,
  multi-level structure, and parsimony – and demonstrates the inadequacy of current
  methods in meeting these criteria comprehensively. We introduce a variational Bayesian
  explanation framework, dubbed ProbAbilistic Concept Explainers (PACE), which models
  the distributions of patch embeddings to provide trustworthy post-hoc conceptual
  explanations. Our qualitative analysis reveals the distributions of patch-level
  concepts, elucidating the effectiveness of ViTs by modeling the joint distribution
  of patch embeddings and ViT’s predictions. Moreover, these patch-level explanations
  bridge the gap between image-level and dataset-level explanations, thus completing
  the multi-level structure of PACE. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic
  and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that PACE surpasses state-of-the-art methods
  in terms of the defined desiderata.
