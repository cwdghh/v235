title: 'DéjàVu: KV-cache Streaming for Fast, Fault-tolerant Generative LLM Serving'
openreview: AbGbGZFYOD
abstract: 'Distributed LLM serving is costly and often underutilizes hardware accelerators
  due to three key challenges: bubbles in pipeline-parallel deployments caused by
  the bimodal latency of prompt and token processing, GPU memory overprovisioning,
  and long recovery times in case of failures. DéjàVu addresses all these challenges
  using a versatile and efficient KV cache streaming library (DéjàVuLib). Using DéjàVuLib,
  we propose and implement efficient prompt-token disaggregation to reduce pipeline
  bubbles, microbatch swapping for efficient GPU memory management, and state replication
  for fault-tolerance. We highlight the efficacy of these solutions on a range of
  large models across cloud deployments.'
