title: 'Learning Low-dimensional Latent Dynamics from High-dimensional Observations:
  Non-asymptotics and Lower Bounds'
openreview: fOBas5H4Xc
abstract: In this paper, we focus on learning a linear time-invariant (LTI) model
  with low-dimensional latent variables but high-dimensional observations. We provide
  an algorithm that recovers the high-dimensional features, i.e. column space of the
  observer, embeds the data into low dimensions and learns the low-dimensional model
  parameters. Our algorithm enjoys a sample complexity guarantee of order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n/\epsilon^2)$,
  where $n$ is the observation dimension. We further establish a fundamental lower
  bound indicating this complexity bound is optimal up to logarithmic factors and
  dimension-independent constants. We show that this inevitable linear factor of $n$
  is due to the learning error of the observerâ€™s column space in the presence of high-dimensional
  noises. Extending our results, we consider a meta-learning problem inspired by various
  real-world applications, where the observer column space can be collectively learned
  from datasets of multiple LTI systems. An end-to-end algorithm is then proposed,
  facilitating learning LTI systems from a meta-dataset which breaks the sample complexity
  lower bound in certain scenarios.
