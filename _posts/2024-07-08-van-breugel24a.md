title: 'Position: Why Tabular Foundation Models Should Be a Research Priority'
openreview: amRSBdZlw9
abstract: 'Recent text and image foundation models are incredibly impressive, and
  these models are attracting an ever-increasing portion of research resources. In
  this position piece we aim to shift the ML research communityâ€™s priorities ever
  so slightly to a different modality: tabular data. Tabular data is the dominant
  modality in many fields, yet it is given hardly any research attention and significantly
  lags behind in terms of scale and power. <b>We believe the time is now to start
  developing tabular foundation models</b>, or what we coin a <em>Large Tabular Model</em>
  (LTM). LTMs could revolutionise the way science and ML use tabular data: not as
  single datasets that are analyzed in a vacuum, but contextualized with respect to
  related datasets. The potential impact is far-reaching: from few-shot tabular models
  to automating data science; from out-of-distribution synthetic data to empowering
  multidisciplinary scientific discovery. We intend to excite reflections on the modalities
  we study, and convince some researchers to study Large Tabular Models.'
