title: Discovering Symmetry Breaking in Physical Systems with Relaxed Group Convolution
openreview: 59oXyDTLJv
abstract: Modeling symmetry breaking is essential for understanding the fundamental
  changes in the behaviors and properties of physical systems, from microscopic particle
  interactions to macroscopic phenomena like fluid dynamics and cosmic structures.
  Thus, identifying sources of asymmetry is an important tool for understanding physical
  systems. In this paper, we focus on learning asymmetries of data using relaxed group
  convolutions. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence that this flexible
  convolution technique allows the model to maintain the highest level of equivariance
  that is consistent with data and discover the subtle symmetry-breaking factors in
  various physical systems. We employ various relaxed group convolution architectures
  to uncover various symmetry-breaking factors that are interpretable and physically
  meaningful in different physical systems, including the phase transition of crystal
  structure, the isotropy and homogeneity breaking in turbulent flow, and the time-reversal
  symmetry breaking in pendulum systems.
