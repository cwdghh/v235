title: On the Duality Between Sharpness-Aware Minimization and Adversarial Training
openreview: 2B2U5kkGUA
abstract: Adversarial Training (AT), which adversarially perturb the input samples
  during training, has been acknowledged as one of the most effective defenses against
  adversarial attacks, yet suffers from inevitably decreased clean accuracy. Instead
  of perturbing the samples, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) perturbs the model
  weights during training to find a more flat loss landscape and improve generalization.
  However, as SAM is designed for better clean accuracy, its effectiveness in enhancing
  adversarial robustness remains unexplored. In this work, considering the duality
  between SAM and AT, we investigate the adversarial robustness derived from SAM.
  Intriguingly, we find that using SAM alone can improve adversarial robustness. To
  understand this unexpected property of SAM, we first provide empirical and theoretical
  insights into how SAM can implicitly learn more robust features, and conduct comprehensive
  experiments to show that SAM can improve adversarial robustness notably without
  sacrificing any clean accuracy, shedding light on the potential of SAM to be a substitute
  for AT when accuracy comes at a higher priority. Code is available at https://github.com/weizeming/SAM_AT.
