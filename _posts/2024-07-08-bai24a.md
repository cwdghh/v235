title: 'QBMK: Quantum-based Matching Kernels for Un-attributed Graphs'
openreview: PYDCwWvbG7
abstract: In this work, we develop a new Quantum-based Matching Kernel (QBMK) for
  un-attributed graphs, by computing the kernel-based similarity between the quantum
  Shannon entropies of aligned vertices through the Continuous-time Quantum Walk (CTQW).
  The theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed QBMK kernel not only addresses
  the shortcoming of neglecting the structural correspondence information between
  graphs arising in existing R-convolution graph kernels, but also overcomes the problem
  of neglecting the structural differences between pairs of aligned vertices arising
  in existing vertex-based matching kernels. Moreover, the proposed QBMK kernel can
  simultaneously capture both global and local structural characteristics through
  the quantum Shannon entropies. Experimental evaluations on standard graph datasets
  demonstrate that the proposed QBMK kernel is able to outperform state-of-the-art
  graph kernels and graph deep learning approaches.
