title: 'Private Gradient Descent for Linear Regression: Tighter Error Bounds and Instance-Specific
  Uncertainty Estimation'
openreview: igRAPavrrS
abstract: 'We provide an improved analysis of standard differentially private gradient
  descent for linear regression under the squared error loss. Under modest assumptions
  on the input, we characterize the distribution of the iterate at each time step.
  Our analysis leads to new results on the algorithm’s accuracy: for a proper fixed
  choice of hyperparameters, the sample complexity depends only linearly on the dimension
  of the data. This matches the dimension-dependence of the (non-private) ordinary
  least squares estimator as well as that of recent private algorithms that rely on
  sophisticated adaptive gradient-clipping schemes (Varshney et al., 2022; Liu et
  al., 2023). Our analysis of the iterates’ distribution also allows us to construct
  confidence intervals for the empirical optimizer which adapt automatically to the
  variance of the algorithm on a particular data set. We validate our theorems through
  experiments on synthetic data.'
