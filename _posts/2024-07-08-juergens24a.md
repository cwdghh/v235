title: Is Epistemic Uncertainty Faithfully Represented by Evidential Deep Learning
  Methods?
openreview: mxjB0LIgpT
abstract: Trustworthy ML systems should not only return accurate predictions, but
  also a reliable representation of their uncertainty. Bayesian methods are commonly
  used to quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, but alternative approaches,
  such as evidential deep learning methods, have become popular in recent years. The
  latter group of methods in essence extends empirical risk minimization (ERM) for
  predicting second-order probability distributions over outcomes, from which measures
  of epistemic (and aleatoric) uncertainty can be extracted. This paper presents novel
  theoretical insights of evidential deep learning, highlighting the difficulties
  in optimizing second-order loss functions and interpreting the resulting epistemic
  uncertainty measures. With a systematic setup that covers a wide range of approaches
  for classification, regression and counts, it provides novel insights into issues
  of identifiability and convergence in second-order loss minimization, and the relative
  (rather than absolute) nature of epistemic uncertainty measures.
