title: Triple Changes Estimator for Targeted Policies
openreview: yzNEkTmcoF
abstract: The renowned difference-in-differences (DiD) estimator relies on the assumption
  of ’parallel trends,’ which may not hold in many practical applications. To address
  this issue, economists are increasingly considering the triple difference estimator
  as a more credible alternative. Both DiD and triple difference are limited to assessing
  average effects exclusively. An alternative avenue is offered by the changes-in-changes
  (CiC) estimator, which provides an estimate of the entire counterfactual distribution
  by relying on assumptions imposed on the distribution of potential outcomes. In
  this work, we extend the triple difference estimator to accommodate the CiC framework,
  presenting the ‘triple changes estimator’ and its identification assumptions, thereby
  expanding the scope of the CiC paradigm. Subsequently, we empirically evaluate the
  proposed framework and apply it to a study examining the impact of Medicaid expansion
  on children’s preventive care.
