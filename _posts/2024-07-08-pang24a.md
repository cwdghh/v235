title: Self-Alignment of Large Language Models via Monopolylogue-based Social Scene
  Simulation
openreview: l7shXGuGBT
abstract: 'Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values is imperative to
  mitigate potential adverse effects resulting from their misuse. Drawing from the
  sociological insight that acknowledging all parties’ concerns is a key factor in
  shaping human values, this paper proposes a novel direction to align LLMs by themselves:
  social scene simulation. To achieve this, we present MATRIX, a novel social scene
  simulator that emulates realistic scenes around a user’s input query, enabling the
  LLM to take social consequences into account before responding. MATRIX serves as
  a virtual rehearsal space, akin to a Monopolylogue, where the LLM performs diverse
  roles related to the query and practice by itself. To inject this alignment, we
  fine-tune the LLM with MATRIX-simulated data, ensuring adherence to human values
  without compromising inference speed. We theoretically show that the LLM with MATRIX
  outperforms existing methods under mild assumptions. Finally, extensive experiments
  validate that our method outperforms over 10 baselines across 4 benchmarks. As evidenced
  by 875 user ratings, our tuned 13B-size LLM exceeds GPT-4 in aligning with human
  values. See our project page at https://shuotang123.github.io/MATRIX.'
