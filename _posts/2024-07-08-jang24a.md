title: 'Rethinking DP-SGD in Discrete Domain: Exploring Logistic Distribution in the
  Realm of signSGD'
openreview: TtSFg4s3F0
abstract: 'Deep neural networks (DNNs) have a risk of remembering sensitive data from
  their training datasets, inadvertently leading to substantial information leakage
  through privacy attacks like membership inference attacks. DP-SGD is a simple but
  effective defense method, incorporating Gaussian noise into gradient updates to
  safeguard sensitive information. With the prevalence of large neural networks, DP-signSGD,
  a variant of DP-SGD, has emerged, aiming to curtail memory usage while maintaining
  security. However, it is noteworthy that most DP-signSGD algorithms default to Gaussian
  noise, suitable only for DP-SGD, without scant discussion of its appropriateness
  for signSGD. Our study delves into an intriguing question: <b>"Can we find a more
  efficient substitute for Gaussian noise to secure privacy in DP-signSGD?"</b> We
  propose an answer with a Logistic mechanism, which conforms to signSGD principles
  and is interestingly evolved from an exponential mechanism. In this paper, we provide
  both theoretical and experimental evidence showing that our method surpasses DP-signSGD.'
