title: 'Configurable Mirror Descent: Towards a Unification of Decision Making'
openreview: U841CrDUx9
abstract: 'Decision-making problems, categorized as single-agent, e.g., Atari, cooperative
  multi-agent, e.g., Hanabi, competitive multi-agent, e.g., Holdâ€™em poker, and mixed
  cooperative and competitive, e.g., football, are ubiquitous in the real world. Although
  various methods have been proposed to address the specific decision-making categories,
  these methods typically evolve independently and cannot generalize to other categories.
  Therefore, a fundamental question for decision-making is: <em>Can we develop </em><em>a
  single algorithm</em><em> to tackle </em><em>ALL</em><em> categories of decision-making
  problems?</em> There are several main challenges to address this question: i) different
  decision-making categories involve different numbers of agents and different relationships
  between agents, ii) different categories have different solution concepts and evaluation
  measures, and iii) there lacks a comprehensive benchmark covering all the categories.
  This work presents a preliminary attempt to address the question with three main
  contributions. i) We propose the generalized mirror descent (GMD), a generalization
  of MD variants, which considers multiple historical policies and works with a broader
  class of Bregman divergences. ii) We propose the configurable mirror descent (CMD)
  where a meta-controller is introduced to dynamically adjust the hyper-parameters
  in GMD conditional on the evaluation measures. iii) We construct the GameBench with
  15 academic-friendly games across different decision-making categories. Extensive
  experiments demonstrate that CMD achieves empirically competitive or better outcomes
  compared to baselines while providing the capability of exploring diverse dimensions
  of decision making.'
