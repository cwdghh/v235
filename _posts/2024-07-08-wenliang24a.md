title: Distributional Bellman Operators over Mean Embeddings
openreview: j2pLfsBm4J
abstract: We propose a novel algorithmic framework for distributional reinforcement
  learning, based on learning finite-dimensional mean embeddings of return distributions.
  The framework reveals a wide variety of new algorithms for dynamic programming and
  temporal-difference algorithms that rely on the sketch Bellman operator, which updates
  mean embeddings with simple linear-algebraic computations. We provide asymptotic
  convergence theory, and examine the empirical performance of the algorithms on a
  suite of tabular tasks. Further, we show that this approach can be straightforwardly
  combined with deep reinforcement learning.
