title: An Improved Finite-time Analysis of Temporal Difference Learning with Deep
  Neural Networks
openreview: dqdctVbSfs
abstract: Temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms with neural network function
  parameterization have well-established empirical success in many practical large-scale
  reinforcement learning tasks. However, theoretical understanding of these algorithms
  remains challenging due to the nonlinearity of the action-value approximation. In
  this paper, we develop an improved non-asymptotic analysis of the neural TD method
  with a general $L$-layer neural network. New proof techniques are developed and
  an improved new $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-1})$ sample complexity is derived.
  To our best knowledge, this is the first finite-time analysis of neural TD that
  achieves an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-1})$ complexity under the Markovian
  sampling, as opposed to the best known $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ complexity
  in the existing literature.
