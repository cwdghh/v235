title: Sign Rank Limitations for Inner Product Graph Decoders
openreview: Lb8G2dZjcB
abstract: Inner product-based decoders are among the most influential frameworks used
  to extract meaningful data from latent embeddings. However, such decoders have shown
  limitations in representation capacity in numerous works within the literature,
  which have been particularly notable in graph reconstruction problems. In this paper,
  we provide the first theoretical elucidation of this pervasive phenomenon in graph
  data, and suggest straightforward modifications to circumvent this issue without
  deviating from the inner product framework.
