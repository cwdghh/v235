title: 'MusicFlow: Cascaded Flow Matching for Text Guided Music Generation'
openreview: kOczKjmYum
abstract: We introduce MusicFlow, a cascaded text-to-music generation model based
  on flow matching. Based on self-supervised representations to bridge between text
  descriptions and music audios, we construct two flow matching networks to model
  the conditional distribution of semantic and acoustic features. Additionally, we
  leverage masked prediction as the training objective, enabling the model to generalize
  to other tasks such as music infilling and continuation in a zero-shot manner. Experiments
  on MusicCaps reveal that the music generated by MusicFlow exhibits superior quality
  and text coherence despite being over $2\sim5$ times smaller and requiring $5$ times
  fewer iterative steps. Simultaneously, the model can perform other music generation
  tasks and achieves competitive performance in music infilling and continuation.
