title: Federated Combinatorial Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandits
openreview: lrFwPeDdEQ
abstract: This paper introduces a federated learning framework tailored for online
  combinatorial optimization with bandit feedback. In this setting, agents select
  subsets of arms, observe noisy rewards for these subsets without accessing individual
  arm information, and can cooperate and share information at specific intervals.
  Our framework transforms any offline resilient single-agent $(\alpha-\epsilon)$-approximation
  algorithm—having a complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{\psi}{\epsilon^\beta}\right)$,
  where the logarithm is omitted, for some function $\psi$ and constant $\beta$—into
  an online multi-agent algorithm with $m$ communicating agents and an $\alpha$-regret
  of no more than $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(m^{-\frac{1}{3+\beta}} \psi^\frac{1}{3+\beta}
  T^\frac{2+\beta}{3+\beta}\right)$. Our approach not only eliminates the $\epsilon$
  approximation error but also ensures sublinear growth with respect to the time horizon
  $T$ and demonstrates a linear speedup with an increasing number of communicating
  agents. Additionally, the algorithm is notably communication-efficient, requiring
  only a sublinear number of communication rounds, quantified as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\psi
  T^\frac{\beta}{\beta+1}\right)$. Furthermore, the framework has been successfully
  applied to online stochastic submodular maximization using various offline algorithms,
  yielding the first results for both single-agent and multi-agent settings and recovering
  specialized single-agent theoretical guarantees. We empirically validate our approach
  to a stochastic data summarization problem, illustrating the effectiveness of the
  proposed framework, even in single-agent scenarios.
