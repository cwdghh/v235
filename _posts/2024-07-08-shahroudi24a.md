title: Evaluation of Trajectory Distribution Predictions with Energy Score
openreview: FCmWhJQ14I
abstract: Predicting the future trajectory of surrounding objects is inherently uncertain
  and vital in the safe and reliable planning of autonomous systems such as in self-driving
  cars. Although trajectory prediction models have become increasingly sophisticated
  in dealing with the complexities of spatiotemporal data, the evaluation methods
  used to assess these models have not kept pace. "Minimum of N" is a common family
  of metrics used to assess the rich outputs of such models. We critically examine
  the Minimum of N within the proper scoring rules framework to show that it is not
  strictly proper and demonstrate how that could lead to a misleading assessment of
  multimodal trajectory predictions. As an alternative, we propose using Energy Score-based
  evaluation measures, leveraging their proven propriety for a more reliable evaluation
  of trajectory distribution predictions.
