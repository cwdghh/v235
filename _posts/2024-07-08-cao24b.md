title: Limited Preference Aided Imitation Learning from Imperfect Demonstrations
openreview: PAbkWU0KDG
abstract: 'Imitation learning mimics high-quality policies from expert data for sequential
  decision-making tasks. However, its efficacy is hindered in scenarios where optimal
  demonstrations are unavailable, and only imperfect demonstrations are present. To
  address this issue, introducing additional limited human preferences is a suitable
  approach as it can be obtained in a human-friendly manner, offering a promising
  way to learn the policy that exceeds the performance of imperfect demonstrations.
  In this paper, we propose a novel imitation learning (IL) algorithm, <b>P</b>reference
  <b>A</b>ided <b>I</b>mitation <b>L</b>earning from imperfect demonstrations (PAIL).
  Specifically, PAIL learns a preference reward by querying experts for limited preferences
  from imperfect demonstrations. This serves two purposes during training: 1) Reweighting
  imperfect demonstrations with the preference reward for higher quality. 2) Selecting
  explored trajectories with high cumulative preference rewards to augment imperfect
  demonstrations. The dataset with continuously improving quality empowers the performance
  of PAIL to transcend the initial demonstrations. Comprehensive empirical results
  across a synthetic task and two locomotion benchmarks show that PAIL surpasses baselines
  by <b>73.2%</b> and breaks through the performance bottleneck of imperfect demonstrations.'
