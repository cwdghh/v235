title: 'Careful with that Scalpel: Improving Gradient Surgery with an EMA'
openreview: IgwtflILyj
abstract: Beyond minimizing a single training loss, many deep learning estimation
  pipelines rely on an auxiliary objective to quantify and encourage desirable properties
  of the model (e.g. performance on another dataset, robustness, agreement with a
  prior). Although the simplest approach to incorporating an auxiliary loss is to
  sum it with the training loss as a regularizer, recent works have shown that one
  can improve performance by blending the gradients beyond a simple sum; this is known
  as <em>gradient surgery</em>. We cast the problem as a constrained minimization
  problem where the auxiliary objective is minimized among the set of minimizers of
  the training loss. To solve this bilevel problem, we follow a parameter update direction
  that combines the training loss gradient and the orthogonal projection of the auxiliary
  gradient to the training gradient. In a setting where gradients come from mini-batches,
  we explain how, using a moving average of the training loss gradients, we can carefully
  maintain this critical orthogonality property. We demonstrate that our method, Bloop,
  can lead to much better performances on NLP and vision experiments than other gradient
  surgery methods without EMA.
