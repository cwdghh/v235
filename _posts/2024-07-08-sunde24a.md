title: On a Combinatorial Problem Arising in Machine Teaching
openreview: spOpHW1No2
abstract: We study a model of machine teaching where the teacher mapping is constructed
  from a size function on both concepts and examples. The main question in machine
  teaching is the minimum number of examples needed for any concept, the so-called
  teaching dimension. A recent paper (Ferri et al., 2024) conjectured that the worst
  case for this model, as a function of the size of the concept class, occurs when
  the consistency matrix contains the binary representations of numbers from zero
  and up. In this paper we prove their conjecture. The result can be seen as a generalization
  of a theorem resolving the edge isoperimetry problem for hypercubes (Hart, 1976),
  and our proof is based on a lemma of (Graham, 1970).
