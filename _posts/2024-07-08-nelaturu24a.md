title: On The Fairness Impacts of Hardware Selection in Machine Learning
openreview: weixEb6Wjd
abstract: In the machine learning ecosystem, hardware selection is often regarded
  as a mere utility, overshadowed by the spotlight on algorithms and data. This is
  especially relevant in contexts like ML-as-a-service platforms, where users often
  lack control over the hardware used for model deployment. This paper investigates
  the influence of hardware on the delicate balance between model performance and
  fairness. We demonstrate that hardware choices can exacerbate existing disparities,
  attributing these discrepancies to variations in gradient flows and loss surfaces
  across different demographic groups. Through both theoretical and empirical analysis,
  the paper not only identifies the underlying factors but also proposes an effective
  strategy for mitigating hardware-induced performance imbalances.
