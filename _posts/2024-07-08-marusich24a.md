title: Using AI Uncertainty Quantification to Improve Human Decision-Making
openreview: fowZNENcVJ
abstract: AI Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) has the potential to improve human decision-making
  beyond AI predictions alone by providing additional probabilistic information to
  users. The majority of past research on AI and human decision-making has concentrated
  on model explainability and interpretability, with little focus on understanding
  the potential impact of UQ on human decision-making. We evaluated the impact on
  human decision-making for instance-level UQ, calibrated using a strict scoring rule,
  in two online behavioral experiments. In the first experiment, our results showed
  that UQ was beneficial for decision-making performance compared to only AI predictions.
  In the second experiment, we found UQ had generalizable benefits for decision-making
  across a variety of representations for probabilistic information. These results
  indicate that implementing high quality, instance-level UQ for AI may improve decision-making
  with real systems compared to AI predictions alone.
