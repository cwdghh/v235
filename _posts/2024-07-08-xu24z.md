title: Learning 1-Bit Tiny Object Detector with Discriminative Feature Refinement
openreview: PlM30j9i80
abstract: 1-bit detectors show impressive performance comparable to their real-valued
  counterparts when detecting commonly sized objects while exhibiting significant
  performance degradation on tiny objects. The challenge stems from the fact that
  high-level features extracted by 1-bit convolutions seem less compelling to reveal
  the discriminative foreground features. To address these issues, we introduce a
  Discriminative Feature Refinement method for 1-bit Detectors (DFR-Det), aiming to
  enhance the discriminative ability of foreground representation for tiny objects
  in aerial images. This is accomplished by refining the feature representation using
  an information bottleneck (IB) to achieve a distinctive representation of tiny objects.
  Specifically, we introduce a new decoder with a foreground mask, aiming to enhance
  the discriminative ability of high-level features for the target but suppress the
  background impact. Additionally, our decoder is simple but effective and can be
  easily mounted on existing detectors without extra burden added to the inference
  procedure. Extensive experiments on various tiny object detection (TOD) tasks demonstrate
  DFR-Detâ€™s superiority over state-of-the-art 1-bit detectors. For example, 1-bit
  FCOS achieved by DFR-Det achieves the 12.8% AP on AI-TOD dataset, approaching the
  performance of the real-valued counterpart.
