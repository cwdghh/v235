title: A Theory of Fault-Tolerant Learning
openreview: ooh8tkXKyR
abstract: Developing machine learning models that account for potential faults encountered
  in real-world environments presents a fundamental challenge for mission-critical
  applications. In this paper, we introduce a novel theoretical framework grounded
  in learning theory for dealing with faults. In particular, we propose a framework
  called <em>fault-tolerant PAC learning</em>, aimed at identifying the most fault-tolerant
  models from a given hypothesis class (such as neural networks). We show that if
  faults occur randomly, fault-tolerant learning is equivalent to regular PAC learning.
  However, for <em>adversarial</em> faults, we show that the sample complexity of
  fault-tolerant PAC learning can grow linearly w.r.t. the number of perturbing functions
  induced by the faults, even for a hypothesis class with VC-dimension 1. We then
  provide a matching upper bound by restricting the number of perturbing functions.
  Finally, we show that the linear dependency on the number of perturbing functions
  can be substantially improved for <em>deletion faults</em> in neural networks. Our
  work provides a powerful formal framework and avenues for a number of future investigations
  on the precise characterization of fault-tolerant learning.
