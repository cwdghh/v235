title: Differentially private exact recovery for stochastic block models
openreview: MIRQ3L8vtn
abstract: Stochastic block models (SBMs) are a very commonly studied network model
  for community detection algorithms. In the standard form of an SBM, the $n$ vertices
  (or nodes) of a graph are generally divided into multiple pre-determined communities
  (or clusters). Connections between pairs of vertices are generated randomly and
  independently with pre-defined probabilities, which depend on the communities containing
  the two nodes. A fundamental problem in SBMs is the recovery of the community structure,
  and sharp information-theoretic bounds are known for recoverability for many versions
  of SBMs. Our focus here is the recoverability problem in SBMs when the network is
  private. Under the edge differential privacy model, we derive conditions for exact
  recoverability in three different versions of SBMs, namely Asymmetric SBM (when
  communities have non-uniform sizes), General Structure SBM (with outliers), and
  Censored SBM (with edge features). Our private algorithms have polynomial running
  time w.r.t. the input graphâ€™s size, and match the recovery thresholds of the non-private
  setting when $\epsilon\rightarrow\infty$. In contrast, the previous best results
  for recoverability in SBMs only hold for the symmetric case (equal size communities),
  and run in quasi-polynomial time, or in polynomial time with recovery thresholds
  being tight up to some constants from the non-private settings.
