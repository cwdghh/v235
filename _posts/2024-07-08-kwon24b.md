title: On The Complexity of First-Order Methods in Stochastic Bilevel Optimization
openreview: OQ97v7uRGc
abstract: 'We consider the problem of finding stationary points in Bilevel optimization
  when the lower-level problem is unconstrained and strongly convex. The problem has
  been extensively studied in recent years; the main technical challenge is to keep
  track of lower-level solutions $y^*(x)$ in response to the changes in the upper-level
  variables $x$. Subsequently, all existing approaches tie their analyses to a genie
  algorithm that knows lower-level solutions and, therefore, need not query any points
  far from them. We consider a dual question to such approaches: suppose we have an
  oracle, which we call $y^*$-aware, that returns an $O(\epsilon)$-estimate of the
  lower-level solution, in addition to first-order gradient estimators <em>locally
  unbiased</em> within the $\Theta(\epsilon)$-ball around $y^*(x)$. We study the complexity
  of finding stationary points with such an $y^*$-aware oracle: we propose a simple
  first-order method that converges to an $\epsilon$ stationary point using $O(\epsilon^{-6}),
  O(\epsilon^{-4})$ access to first-order $y^*$-aware oracles. Our upper bounds also
  apply to standard unbiased first-order oracles, improving the best-known complexity
  of first-order methods by $O(\epsilon)$ with minimal assumptions. We then provide
  the matching $\Omega(\epsilon^{-6})$, $\Omega(\epsilon^{-4})$ lower bounds without
  and with an additional smoothness assumption, respectively. Our results imply that
  any approach that simulates an algorithm with an $y^*$-aware oracle must suffer
  the same lower bounds.'
