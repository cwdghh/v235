title: Structure-Aware E(3)-Invariant Molecular Conformer Aggregation Networks
openreview: qGEEso256L
abstract: A molecule’s 2D representation consists of its atoms, their attributes,
  and the molecule’s covalent bonds. A 3D (geometric) representation of a molecule
  is called a conformer and consists of its atom types and Cartesian coordinates.
  Every conformer has a potential energy, and the lower this energy, the more likely
  it occurs in nature. Most existing machine learning methods for molecular property
  prediction consider either 2D molecular graphs or 3D conformer structure representations
  in isolation. Inspired by recent work on using ensembles of conformers in conjunction
  with 2D graph representations, we propose E(3)-invariant molecular conformer aggregation
  networks. The method integrates a molecule’s 2D representation with that of multiple
  of its conformers. Contrary to prior work, we propose a novel 2D–3D aggregation
  mechanism based on a differentiable solver for the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein Barycenter
  problem and the use of an efficient conformer generation method based on distance
  geometry. We show that the proposed aggregation mechanism is E(3) invariant and
  propose an efficient GPU implementation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the aggregation
  mechanism helps to significantly outperform state-of-the-art molecule property prediction
  methods on established datasets.
