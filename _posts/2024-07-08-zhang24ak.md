title: Self-Consistency Training for Density-Functional-Theory Hamiltonian Prediction
openreview: Vw4Yar2fmW
abstract: 'Predicting the mean-field Hamiltonian matrix in density functional theory
  is a fundamental formulation to leverage machine learning for solving molecular
  science problems. Yet, its applicability is limited by insufficient labeled data
  for training. In this work, we highlight that Hamiltonian prediction possesses a
  self-consistency principle, based on which we propose self-consistency training,
  an exact training method that does not require labeled data. It distinguishes the
  task from predicting other molecular properties by the following benefits: (1) it
  enables the model to be trained on a large amount of unlabeled data, hence addresses
  the data scarcity challenge and enhances generalization; (2) it is more efficient
  than running DFT to generate labels for supervised training, since it amortizes
  DFT calculation over a set of queries. We empirically demonstrate the better generalization
  in data-scarce and out-of-distribution scenarios, and the better efficiency over
  DFT labeling. These benefits push forward the applicability of Hamiltonian prediction
  to an ever-larger scale.'
