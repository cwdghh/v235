title: 'TVE: Learning Meta-attribution for Transferable Vision Explainer'
openreview: 0ZTuy5CrL7
abstract: Explainable machine learning significantly improves the transparency of
  deep neural networks. However, existing work is constrained to explaining the behavior
  of individual model predictions, and lacks the ability to transfer the explanation
  across various models and tasks. This limitation results in explaining various tasks
  being time- and resource-consuming. To address this problem, we introduce a <b>Transferable
  Vision Explainer</b> (TVE) that can effectively explain various vision models in
  downstream tasks. Specifically, the transferability of TVE is realized through a
  pre-training process on large-scale datasets towards learning the meta-attribution.
  This meta-attribution leverages the versatility of generic backbone encoders to
  comprehensively encode the attribution knowledge for the input instance, which enables
  TVE to seamlessly transfer to explaining various downstream tasks, without the need
  for training on task-specific data. Empirical studies involve explaining three different
  architectures of vision models across three diverse downstream datasets. The experiment
  results indicate TVE is effective in explaining these tasks without the need for
  additional training on downstream data.
