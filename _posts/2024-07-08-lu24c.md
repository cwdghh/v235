title: 'Position: Exploring the Robustness of Pipeline-Parallelism-Based Decentralized
  Training'
openreview: WPfYVdJHPk
abstract: Modern machine learning applications increasingly demand greater computational
  resources for training large models. Decentralized training has emerged as an effective
  means to democratize this technology. However, the potential threats associated
  with this approach remain inadequately discussed, posing a hurdle to the development
  of decentralized training infrastructures. This paper aims to initiate discussion
  towards this end by exploring the robustness of decentralized training from three
  primary perspectives. Firstly, we articulate our position on establishing robust
  decentralized training by outlining potential threats and the corresponding countermeasures.
  Secondly, we illustrate a nascent poisoning attack targeting decentralized training
  frameworks, easily executable by malicious stages. To mitigate this security threat
  and ensure efficient training, we propose a robust training framework, integrating
  a 100% detection strategy and efficient training mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate
  the severity of the proposed attack and the effectiveness of our robust training
  framework. This position paper emphasizes the urgency of exploring the robustness
  of decentralized training and proposes a feasible solution. The code is available
