title: Learning Constraints from Offline Demonstrations via Superior Distribution
  Correction Estimation
openreview: Ax90jQPbgF
abstract: An effective approach for learning both safety constraints and control policies
  is Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (ICRL). Previous ICRL algorithms commonly
  employ an online learning framework that permits unlimited sampling from an interactive
  environment. This setting, however, is infeasible in many realistic applications
  where data collection is dangerous and expensive. To address this challenge, we
  propose Inverse Constrained Superior Distribution Correction Estimation (ICSDICE)
  as an offline ICRL solver. ICSDICE extracts feasible constraints from superior distributions,
  thereby highlighting policies with expert-exceeding rewards maximization ability.
  To estimate these distributions, ICSDICE solves a regularized dual optimization
  problem for safe control by exploiting the observed reward signals and expert preferences.
  Striving for transferable constraints and unbiased estimations, ICSDICE actively
  encourages sparsity and incorporates a discounting effect within the learned and
  observed distributions. Empirical studies show that ICSDICE outperforms other baselines
  by accurately recovering the constraints and adapting to high-dimensional environments.
