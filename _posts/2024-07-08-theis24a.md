title: 'Position: What makes an image realistic?'
openreview: a6366lEzbX
abstract: The last decade has seen tremendous progress in our ability to <em>generate</em>
  realistic-looking data, be it images, text, audio, or video. Here, we discuss the
  closely related problem of <em>quantifying</em> realism, that is, designing functions
  that can reliably tell realistic data from unrealistic data. This problem turns
  out to be significantly harder to solve and remains poorly understood, despite its
  prevalence in machine learning and recent breakthroughs in generative AI. Drawing
  on insights from algorithmic information theory, we discuss why this problem is
  challenging, why a good generative model alone is insufficient to solve it, and
  what a good solution would look like. In particular, we introduce the notion of
  a <em>universal critic</em>, which unlike adversarial critics does not require adversarial
  training. While universal critics are not immediately practical, they can serve
  both as a North Star for guiding practical implementations and as a tool for analyzing
  existing attempts to capture realism.
