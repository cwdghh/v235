title: Mastering Zero-Shot Interactions in Cooperative and Competitive Simultaneous
  Games
openreview: SoqxSnEUi1
abstract: 'The combination of self-play and planning has achieved great successes
  in sequential games, for instance in Chess and Go. However, adapting algorithms
  such as AlphaZero to simultaneous games poses a new challenge. In these games, missing
  information about concurrent actions of other agents is a limiting factor as they
  may select different Nash equilibria or do not play optimally at all. Thus, it is
  vital to model the behavior of the other agents when interacting with them in simultaneous
  games. To this end, we propose Albatross: AlphaZero for Learning Bounded-rational
  Agents and Temperature-based Response Optimization using Simulated Self-play. Albatross
  learns to play the novel equilibrium concept of a Smooth Best Response Logit Equilibrium
  (SBRLE), which enables cooperation and competition with agents of any playing strength.
  We perform an extensive evaluation of Albatross on a set of cooperative and competitive
  simultaneous perfect-information games. In contrast to AlphaZero, Albatross is able
  to exploit weak agents in the competitive game of Battlesnake. Additionally, it
  yields an improvement of 37.6% compared to previous state of the art in the cooperative
  Overcooked benchmark.'
