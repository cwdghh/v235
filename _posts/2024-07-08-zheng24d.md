title: Constrained Exploration via Reflected Replica Exchange Stochastic Gradient
  Langevin Dynamics
openreview: DCmahCZJYb
abstract: 'Replica exchange stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (reSGLD) is an effective
  sampler for non-convex learning in large-scale datasets. However, the simulation
  may encounter stagnation issues when the high-temperature chain delves too deeply
  into the distribution tails. To tackle this issue, we propose reflected reSGLD (r2SGLD):
  an algorithm tailored for constrained non-convex exploration by utilizing reflection
  steps within a bounded domain. Theoretically, we observe that reducing the diameter
  of the domain enhances mixing rates, exhibiting a <em>quadratic</em> behavior. Empirically,
  we test its performance through extensive experiments, including identifying dynamical
  systems with physical constraints, simulations of constrained multi-modal distributions,
  and image classification tasks. The theoretical and empirical findings highlight
  the crucial role of constrained exploration in improving the simulation efficiency.'
