title: Coarse-To-Fine Tensor Trains for Compact Visual Representations
openreview: lGZUvfP2ZF
abstract: 'The ability to learn compact, high-quality, and easy-to-optimize representations
  for visual data is paramount to many applications such as novel view synthesis and
  3D reconstruction. Recent work has shown substantial success in using tensor networks
  to design such compact and high-quality representations. However, the ability to
  optimize tensor-based representations, and in particular, the highly compact tensor
  train representation, is still lacking. This has prevented practitioners from deploying
  the full potential of tensor networks for visual data. To this end, we propose ’Prolongation
  Upsampling Tensor Train (PuTT)’, a novel method for learning tensor train representations
  in a coarse-to-fine manner. Our method involves the prolonging or ‘upsampling’ of
  a learned tensor train representation, creating a sequence of ’coarse-to-fine’ tensor
  trains that are incrementally refined. We evaluate our representation along three
  axes: (1). compression, (2). denoising capability, and (3). image completion capability.
  To assess these axes, we consider the tasks of image fitting, 3D fitting, and novel
  view synthesis, where our method shows an improved performance compared to state-of-the-art
  tensor-based methods.'
