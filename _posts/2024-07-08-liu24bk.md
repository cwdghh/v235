title: 'DNA-SE: Towards Deep Neural-Nets Assisted Semiparametric Estimation'
openreview: OERwuPzHdh
abstract: Semiparametric statistics play a pivotal role in a wide range of domains,
  including but not limited to missing data, causal inference, and transfer learning,
  to name a few. In many settings, semiparametric theory leads to (nearly) statistically
  optimal procedures that yet involve numerically solving Fredholm integral equations
  of the second kind. Traditional numerical methods, such as polynomial or spline
  approximations, are difficult to scale to multi-dimensional problems. Alternatively,
  statisticians may choose to approximate the original integral equations by ones
  with closed-form solutions, resulting in computationally more efficient, but statistically
  suboptimal or even incorrect procedures. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
  framework by formulating the semiparametric estimation problem as a bi-level optimization
  problem; and then we propose a scalable algorithm called <b>D</b>eep <b>N</b>eural-Nets
  <b>A</b>ssisted <b>S</b>emiparametric <b>E</b>stimation ($\mathsf{DNA\mbox{-}SE}$)
  by leveraging the universal approximation property of Deep Neural-Nets (DNN) to
  streamline semiparametric procedures. Through extensive numerical experiments and
  a real data analysis, we demonstrate the numerical and statistical advantages of
  $\mathsf{DNA\mbox{-}SE}$ over traditional methods. To the best of our knowledge,
  we are the first to bring DNN into semiparametric statistics as a numerical solver
  of integral equations in our proposed general framework.
