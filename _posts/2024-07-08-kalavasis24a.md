title: Replicable Learning of Large-Margin Halfspaces
openreview: CKCzfU9YKE
abstract: We provide an efficient replicable algorithm for the problem of learning
  large-margin halfspaces. Our results improve upon the algorithms provided by Impagliazzo,
  Lei, Pitassi, and Sorrell (STOC, 2022). We design the first dimension-independent
  replicable algorithm for this task which runs in polynomial time, is proper, and
  has strictly improved sample complexity compared to the one achieved by Impagliazzo
  et al. (STOC, 2022) with respect to all the relevant parameters. Moreover, our algorithm
  has sample complexity that is optimal with respect to the accuracy parameter $\epsilon$.
  Departing from the requirement of polynomial time algorithms, using the DP-to-Replicability
  reduction of Bun et al. (STOC 2023), we show how to obtain a replicable algorithm
  for large-margin halfspaces with improved sample complexity with respect to the
  margin parameter $\tau$, but running time doubly exponential in $1/\tau^2$ and worse
  sample complexity dependence on $\epsilon$ than our previous algorithm. We then
  design an improved algorithm with better sample complexity than both of our previous
  algorithms and running time exponential in $1/\tau^{2}.$
