title: StrokeNUWA—Tokenizing Strokes for Vector Graphic Synthesis
openreview: eVlx8DaG9h
abstract: To leverage LLMs for visual synthesis, traditional methods convert raster
  image information into discrete grid tokens through specialized visual modules,
  while disrupting the model’s ability to capture the true semantic representation
  of visual scenes. This paper posits that an alternative representation of images,
  vector graphics, can effectively surmount this limitation by enabling a more natural
  and semantically coherent segmentation of the image information. Thus, we introduce
  StrokeNUWA, a pioneering work exploring a better visual representation "stroke"
  tokens on vector graphics, which is inherently visual semantics rich, naturally
  compatible with LLMs, and highly compressed. Equipped with stroke tokens, StrokeNUWA
  can significantly surpass traditional LLM-based and optimization-based methods across
  various metrics in the vector graphic generation task. Besides, StrokeNUWA achieves
  up to a $94\times$ speedup in inference over the speed of prior methods with an
  exceptional SVG code compression ratio of 6.9%.
