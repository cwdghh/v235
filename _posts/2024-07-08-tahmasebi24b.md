title: A Universal Class of Sharpness-Aware Minimization Algorithms
openreview: 9Ub6nLqdMo
abstract: Recently, there has been a surge in interest in developing optimization
  algorithms for overparameterized models as achieving generalization is believed
  to require algorithms with suitable biases. This interest centers on minimizing
  sharpness of the original loss function; the Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)
  algorithm has proven effective. However, most literature only considers a few sharpness
  measures, such as the maximum eigenvalue or trace of the training loss Hessian,
  which may not yield meaningful insights for non-convex optimization scenarios like
  neural networks. Additionally, many sharpness measures are sensitive to parameter
  invariances in neural networks, magnifying significantly under rescaling parameters.
  Motivated by these challenges, we introduce a new class of sharpness measures in
  this paper, leading to new sharpness-aware objective functions. We prove that these
  measures are <em>universally expressive</em>, allowing any function of the training
  loss Hessian matrix to be represented by appropriate hyperparameters. Furthermore,
  we show that the proposed objective functions explicitly bias towards minimizing
  their corresponding sharpness measures, and how they allow meaningful applications
  to models with parameter invariances (such as scale-invariances). Finally, as instances
  of our proposed general framework, we present <em>Frob-SAM</em> and <em>Det-SAM</em>,
  which are specifically designed to minimize the Frobenius norm and the determinant
  of the Hessian of the training loss, respectively. We also demonstrate the advantages
  of our general framework through extensive experiments.
