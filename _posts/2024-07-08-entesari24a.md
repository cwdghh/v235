title: Compositional Curvature Bounds for Deep Neural Networks
openreview: RtnGLJNtEG
abstract: A key challenge that threatens the widespread use of neural networks in
  safety-critical applications is their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this
  paper, we study the second-order behavior of continuously differentiable deep neural
  networks, focusing on robustness against adversarial perturbations. First, we provide
  a theoretical analysis of robustness and attack certificates for deep classifiers
  by leveraging local gradients and upper bounds on the second derivative (curvature
  constant). Next, we introduce a novel algorithm to analytically compute provable
  upper bounds on the second derivative of neural networks. This algorithm leverages
  the compositional structure of the model to propagate the curvature bound layer-by-layer,
  giving rise to a scalable and modular approach. The proposed bound can serve as
  a differentiable regularizer to control the curvature of neural networks during
  training, thereby enhancing robustness. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of
  our method on classification tasks using the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
