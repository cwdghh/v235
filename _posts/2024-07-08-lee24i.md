title: PAC-Bayesian Generalization Bounds for Knowledge Graph Representation Learning
openreview: sOyJSNUrzQ
abstract: While a number of knowledge graph representation learning (KGRL) methods
  have been proposed over the past decade, very few theoretical analyses have been
  conducted on them. In this paper, we present the first PAC-Bayesian generalization
  bounds for KGRL methods. To analyze a broad class of KGRL models, we propose a generic
  framework named ReED (Relation-aware Encoder-Decoder), which consists of a relation-aware
  message passing encoder and a triplet classification decoder. Our ReED framework
  can express at least 15 different existing KGRL models, including not only graph
  neural network-based models such as R-GCN and CompGCN but also shallow-architecture
  models such as RotatE and ANALOGY. Our generalization bounds for the ReED framework
  provide theoretical grounds for the commonly used tricks in KGRL, e.g., parameter-sharing
  and weight normalization schemes, and guide desirable design choices for practical
  KGRL methods. We empirically show that the critical factors in our generalization
  bounds can explain actual generalization errors on three real-world knowledge graphs.
