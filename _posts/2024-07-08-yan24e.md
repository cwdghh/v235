title: Offline Imitation from Observation via Primal Wasserstein State Occupancy Matching
openreview: 4Zr7T6UrBS
abstract: 'In real-world scenarios, arbitrary interactions with the environment can
  often be costly, and actions of expert demonstrations are not always available.
  To reduce the need for both, offline Learning from Observations (LfO) is extensively
  studied: the agent learns to solve a task given only expert states and task-agnostic
  non-expert state-action pairs. The state-of-the-art DIstribution Correction Estimation
  (DICE) methods, as exemplified by SMODICE, minimize the state occupancy divergence
  between the learnerâ€™s and empirical expert policies. However, such methods are limited
  to either $f$-divergences (KL and $\chi^2$) or Wasserstein distance with Rubinstein
  duality, the latter of which constrains the underlying distance metric crucial to
  the performance of Wasserstein-based solutions. To enable more flexible distance
  metrics, we propose Primal Wasserstein DICE (PW-DICE). It minimizes the primal Wasserstein
  distance between the learner and expert state occupancies and leverages a contrastively
  learned distance metric. Theoretically, our framework is a generalization of SMODICE,
  and is the first work that unifies $f$-divergence and Wasserstein minimization.
  Empirically, we find that PW-DICE improves upon several state-of-the-art methods.
