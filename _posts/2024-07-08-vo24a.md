title: Parameter Estimation in DAGs from Incomplete Data via Optimal Transport
openreview: kXde6Qa6Uy
abstract: Estimating the parameters of a probabilistic directed graphical model from
  incomplete data is a long-standing challenge. This is because, in the presence of
  latent variables, both the likelihood function and posterior distribution are intractable
  without assumptions about structural dependencies or model classes. While existing
  learning methods are fundamentally based on likelihood maximization, here we offer
  a new view of the parameter learning problem through the lens of optimal transport.
  This perspective licenses a general framework that operates on any directed graphs
  without making unrealistic assumptions on the posterior over the latent variables
  or resorting to variational approximations. We develop a theoretical framework and
  support it with extensive empirical evidence demonstrating the versatility and robustness
  of our approach. Across experiments, we show that not only can our method effectively
  recover the ground-truth parameters but it also performs comparably or better than
  competing baselines on downstream applications.
