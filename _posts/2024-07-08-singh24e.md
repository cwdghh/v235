title: 'PIPER: Primitive-Informed Preference-based Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
  via Hindsight Relabeling'
openreview: l6Hef6FVd0
abstract: 'In this work, we introduce PIPER: Primitive-Informed Preference-based Hierarchical
  reinforcement learning via Hindsight Relabeling, a novel approach that leverages
  preference-based learning to learn a reward model, and subsequently uses this reward
  model to relabel higher-level replay buffers. Since this reward is unaffected by
  lower primitive behavior, our relabeling-based approach is able to mitigate non-stationarity,
  which is common in existing hierarchical approaches, and demonstrates impressive
  performance across a range of challenging sparse-reward tasks. Since obtaining human
  feedback is typically impractical, we propose to replace the human-in-the-loop approach
  with our primitive-in-the-loop approach, which generates feedback using sparse rewards
  provided by the environment. Moreover, in order to prevent infeasible subgoal prediction
  and avoid degenerate solutions, we propose primitive-informed regularization that
  conditions higher-level policies to generate feasible subgoals for lower-level policies.
  We perform extensive experiments to show that PIPER mitigates non-stationarity in
  hierarchical reinforcement learning and achieves greater than 50$\%$ success rates
  in challenging, sparse-reward robotic environments, where most other baselines fail
  to achieve any significant progress.'
