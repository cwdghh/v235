title: Locally Differentially Private Decentralized Stochastic Bilevel Optimization
  with Guaranteed Convergence Accuracy
openreview: RuH78kOcDi
abstract: Decentralized bilevel optimization based machine learning techniques are
  achieving remarkable success in a wide variety of domains. However, the intensive
  exchange of information (involving nested-loops of consensus or communication iterations)
  in existing decentralized bilevel optimization algorithms leads to a great challenge
  to ensure rigorous differential privacy, which, however, is necessary to bring the
  benefits of machine learning to domains where involved data are sensitive. By proposing
  a new decentralized stochastic bilevel-optimization algorithm which avoids nested-loops
  of information-exchange iterations, we achieve, for the first time, both differential
  privacy and accurate convergence in decentralized bilevel optimization. This is
  significant since even for single-level decentralized optimization and learning,
  existing differential-privacy solutions have to sacrifice convergence accuracy for
  privacy. Besides characterizing the convergence rate under nonconvex/convex/strongly
  convex conditions, we also rigorously quantify the price of differential privacy
  in the convergence rate. Experimental results on machine learning models confirm
  the efficacy of our algorithm.
