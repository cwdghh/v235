title: 'DetKDS: Knowledge Distillation Search for Object Detectors'
openreview: SBR8Gwe1E2
abstract: 'In this paper, we present DetKDS, the first framework that searches for
  optimal detection distillation policies. Manual design of detection distillers becomes
  challenging and time-consuming due to significant disparities in distillation behaviors
  between detectors with different backbones, paradigms, and label assignments. To
  tackle these challenges, we leverage search algorithms to discover optimal distillers
  for homogeneous and heterogeneous student-teacher pairs. Firstly, our search space
  encompasses global features, foreground-background features, instance features,
  logits response, and localization response as inputs. Then, we construct omni-directional
  cascaded transformations and obtain the distiller by selecting the advanced distance
  function and common weight value options. Finally, we present a divide-and-conquer
  evolutionary algorithm to handle the explosion of the search space. In this strategy,
  we first evolve the best distiller formulations of individual knowledge inputs and
  then optimize the combined weights of these multiple distillation losses. DetKDS
  automates the distillation process without requiring expert design or additional
  tuning, effectively reducing the teacher-student gap in various scenarios. Based
  on the analysis of our search results, we provide valuable guidance that contributes
  to detection distillation designs. Comprehensive experiments on different detectors
  demonstrate that DetKDS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection and instance
  segmentation tasks. For instance, DetKDS achieves significant gains than baseline
  detectors: $+3.7$, $+4.1$, $+4.0$, $+3.7$, and $+3.5$ AP on RetinaNet, Faster-RCNN,
  FCOS, RepPoints, and GFL, respectively. Code at: https://github.com/lliai/DetKDS.'
