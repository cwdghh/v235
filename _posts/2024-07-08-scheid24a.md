title: Incentivized Learning in Principal-Agent Bandit Games
openreview: ykgZk6vFrh
abstract: This work considers a repeated principal-agent bandit game, where the principal
  can only interact with her environment through the agent. The principal and the
  agent have misaligned objectives and the choice of action is only left to the agent.
  However, the principal can influence the agent’s decisions by offering incentives
  which add up to his rewards. The principal aims to iteratively learn an incentive
  policy to maximize her own total utility. This framework extends usual bandit problems
  and is motivated by several practical applications, such as healthcare or ecological
  taxation, where traditionally used mechanism design theories often overlook the
  learning aspect of the problem. We present nearly optimal (with respect to a horizon
  $T$) learning algorithms for the principal’s regret in both multi-armed and linear
  contextual settings. Finally, we support our theoretical guarantees through numerical
  experiments.
