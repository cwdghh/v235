title: 'Chatbot Arena: An Open Platform for Evaluating LLMs by Human Preference'
openreview: 3MW8GKNyzI
abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have unlocked new capabilities and applications;
  however, evaluating the alignment with human preferences still poses significant
  challenges. To address this issue, we introduce Chatbot Arena, an open platform
  for evaluating LLMs based on human preferences. Our methodology employs a pairwise
  comparison approach and leverages input from a diverse user base through crowdsourcing.
  The platform has been operational for several months, amassing over 240K votes.
  This paper describes the platform, analyzes the data we have collected so far, and
  explains the tried-and-true statistical methods we are using for efficient and accurate
  evaluation and ranking of models. We confirm that the crowdsourced questions are
  sufficiently diverse and discriminating and that the crowd-sourced human votes are
  in good agreement with those of expert raters. These analyses collectively establish
  a robust foundation for the credibility of Chatbot Arena. Because of its unique
  value and openness, Chatbot Arena has emerged as one of the most referenced LLM
  leaderboards, widely cited by leading LLM developers and companies. The platform
  is publicly available at https://chat.lmsys.org.
