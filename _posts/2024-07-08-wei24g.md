title: Learning Label Shift Correction for Test-Agnostic Long-Tailed Recognition
openreview: J3xYTh6xtL
abstract: Long-tail learning primarily focuses on mitigating the label distribution
  shift between long-tailed training data and uniformly distributed test data. However,
  in real-world applications, we often encounter a more intricate challenge where
  the test label distribution is agnostic. To address this problem, we first theoretically
  establish the substantial potential for reducing the generalization error if we
  can precisely estimate the test label distribution. Motivated by the theoretical
  insight, we introduce a simple yet effective solution called label shift correction
  (LSC). LSC estimates the test label distribution within the proposed framework of
  generalized black box shift estimation, and adjusts the predictions from a pre-trained
  model to align with the test distribution. Theoretical analyses confirm that accurate
  estimation of test label distribution can effectively reduce the generalization
  error. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly
  outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches, especially when confronted with
  non-uniform test label distribution. Notably, the proposed method is general and
  complements existing long-tail learning approaches, consistently improving their
  performance. The source code is available at https://github.com/Stomach-ache/label-shift-correction
