title: CW Complex Hypothesis for Image Data
openreview: XXioxiADDC
abstract: We examine both the manifold hypothesis (Bengio et al., 2013) and the union
  of manifold hypothesis (Brown et al., 2023), and argue that, in contrast to these
  hypotheses, the local intrinsic dimension varies from point to point even in the
  same connected component. We propose an alternative CW complex hypothesis that image
  data is distributed in â€œmanifolds with skeletons". We support the hypothesis through
  visualization of distributions of image data of random geometric objects, as well
  as by introducing and testing a criterion on natural image datasets. One motivation
  of our work is to explain why diffusion models have difficulty generating accurate
  higher dimensional details such as human hands. Under the CW complex hypothesis
  and with both theoretical and empirical evidences, we provide an interpretation
  that the mixture of higher and lower dimensional components in data obstructs diffusion
  models from efficient learning.
