title: Towards Global Optimality for Practical Average Reward Reinforcement Learning
  without Mixing Time Oracles
openreview: ClWdplZ12B
abstract: In the context of average-reward reinforcement learning, the requirement
  for oracle knowledge of the mixing time, a measure of the duration a Markov chain
  under a fixed policy needs to achieve its stationary distribution, poses a significant
  challenge for the global convergence of policy gradient methods. This requirement
  is particularly problematic due to the difficulty and expense of estimating mixing
  time in environments with large state spaces, leading to the necessity of impractically
  long trajectories for effective gradient estimation in practical applications. To
  address this limitation, we consider the Multi-level Actor-Critic (MAC) framework,
  which incorporates a Multi-level Monte-Carlo (MLMC) gradient estimator. With our
  approach, we effectively alleviate the dependency on mixing time knowledge, a first
  for average-reward MDPs global convergence. Furthermore, our approach exhibits the
  tightest available dependence of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\tau_{mix}})$ known from prior
  work. With a 2D grid world goal-reaching navigation experiment, we demonstrate that
  MAC outperforms the existing state-of-the-art policy gradient-based method for average
  reward settings.
