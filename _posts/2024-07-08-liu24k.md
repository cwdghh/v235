title: Unifying Image Processing as Visual Prompting Question Answering
openreview: MUXTt9Yr4T
abstract: Image processing is a fundamental task in computer vision, which aims at
  enhancing image quality and extracting essential features for subsequent vision
  applications. Traditionally, task-specific models are developed for individual tasks
  and designing such models requires distinct expertise. Building upon the success
  of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing (NLP), there is a
  similar trend in computer vision, which focuses on developing large-scale models
  through pretraining and in-context learning. This paradigm shift reduces the reliance
  on task-specific models, yielding a powerful unified model to deal with various
  tasks. However, these advances have predominantly concentrated on high-level vision
  tasks, with less attention paid to low-level vision tasks. To address this issue,
  we propose a universal model for general image processing that covers image restoration,
  image enhancement, image feature extraction tasks, etc. Our proposed framework,
  named PromptGIP, unifies these diverse image processing tasks within a universal
  framework. Inspired by NLP question answering (QA) techniques, we employ a visual
  prompting question answering paradigm. Specifically, we treat the input-output image
  pair as a structured question-answer sentence, thereby reprogramming the image processing
  task as a prompting QA problem. PromptGIP can undertake diverse cross-domain tasks
  using provided visual prompts, eliminating the need for task-specific finetuning.
  Capable of handling up to 15 different image processing tasks, PromptGIP represents
  a versatile and adaptive approach to general image processing. While PromptGIP has
  demonstrated a certain degree of out-of-domain task generalization capability, further
  research is expected to fully explore its more powerful emergent generalization.
