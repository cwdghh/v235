title: Minimum-Norm Interpolation Under Covariate Shift
openreview: Zw7TcnTmHj
abstract: Transfer learning is a critical part of real-world machine learning deployments
  and has been extensively studied in experimental works with overparameterized neural
  networks. However, even in the simplest setting of linear regression a notable gap
  still exists in the theoretical understanding of transfer learning. In-distribution
  research on high-dimensional linear regression has led to the identification of
  a phenomenon known as <em>benign overfitting</em>, in which linear interpolators
  overfit to noisy training labels and yet still generalize well. This behavior occurs
  under specific conditions on the source covariance matrix and input data dimension.
  Therefore, it is natural to wonder how such high-dimensional linear models behave
  under transfer learning. We prove the first non-asymptotic excess risk bounds for
  benignly-overfit linear interpolators in the transfer learning setting. From our
  analysis, we propose a taxonomy of <em>beneficial</em> and <em>malignant</em> covariate
  shifts based on the degree of overparameterization. We follow our analysis with
  empirical studies that show these beneficial and malignant covariate shifts for
  linear interpolators on real image data, and for fully-connected neural networks
  in settings where the input data dimension is larger than the training sample size.
