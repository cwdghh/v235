title: 'Bridging discrete and continuous state spaces: Exploring the Ehrenfest process
  in time-continuous diffusion models'
openreview: 8GYclcxQXB
abstract: Generative modeling via stochastic processes has led to remarkable empirical
  results as well as to recent advances in their theoretical understanding. In principle,
  both space and time of the processes can be discrete or continuous. In this work,
  we study time-continuous Markov jump processes on discrete state spaces and investigate
  their correspondence to state-continuous diffusion processes given by SDEs. In particular,
  we revisit the $\textit{Ehrenfest process}$, which converges to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
  process in the infinite state space limit. Likewise, we can show that the time-reversal
  of the Ehrenfest process converges to the time-reversed Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.
  This observation bridges discrete and continuous state spaces and allows to carry
  over methods from one to the respective other setting, such as for instance loss
  functions that lead to improved convergence. Additionally, we suggest an algorithm
  for training the time-reversal of Markov jump processes which relies on conditional
  expectations and can thus be directly related to denoising score matching. We demonstrate
  our methods in multiple convincing numerical experiments.
