title: Verifying message-passing neural networks via topology-based bounds tightening
openreview: nAoiUlz4Bf
abstract: Since graph neural networks (GNNs) are often vulnerable to attack, we need
  to know when we can trust them. We develop a computationally effective approach
  towards providing robust certificates for message-passing neural networks (MPNNs)
  using a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. Because our work builds
  on mixed-integer optimization, it encodes a wide variety of subproblems, for example
  it admits (i) both adding and removing edges, (ii) both global and local budgets,
  and (iii) both topological perturbations and feature modifications. Our key technology,
  topology-based bounds tightening, uses graph structure to tighten bounds. We also
  experiment with aggressive bounds tightening to dynamically change the optimization
  constraints by tightening variable bounds. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these
  strategies, we implement an extension to the open-source branch-and-cut solver SCIP.
  We test on both node and graph classification problems and consider topological
  attacks that both add and remove edges.
