title: Generalized Sobolev Transport for Probability Measures on a Graph
openreview: 0GC0NG6Orr
abstract: We study the optimal transport (OT) problem for measures supported on a
  graph metric space. Recently, Le et al. (2022) leverage the graph structure and
  propose a variant of OT, namely Sobolev transport (ST), which yields a closed-form
  expression for a fast computation. However, ST is essentially coupled with the $L^p$
  geometric structure within its definition which makes it nontrivial to utilize ST
  for other prior structures. In contrast, the classic OT has the flexibility to adapt
  to various geometric structures by modifying the underlying cost function. An important
  instance is the Orlicz-Wasserstein (OW) which moves beyond the $L^p$ structure by
  leveraging the <em>Orlicz geometric structure</em>. Comparing to the usage of standard
  $p$-order Wasserstein, OW remarkably helps to advance certain machine learning approaches.
  Nevertheless, OW brings up a new challenge on its computation due to its two-level
  optimization formulation. In this work, we leverage a specific class of convex functions
  for Orlicz structure to propose the generalized Sobolev transport (GST). GST encompasses
  the ST as its special case, and can be utilized for prior structures beyond the
  $L^p$ geometry. In connection with the OW, we show that one only needs to simply
  solve a univariate optimization problem to compute the GST, unlike the complex two-level
  optimization problem in OW. We empirically illustrate that GST is several-order
  faster than the OW. Moreover, we provide preliminary evidences on the advantages
  of GST for document classification and for several tasks in topological data analysis.
