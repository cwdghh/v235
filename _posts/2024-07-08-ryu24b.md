title: Operator SVD with Neural Networks via Nested Low-Rank Approximation
openreview: qESG5HaaoJ
abstract: Computing eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of a given linear operator, or
  finding its leading eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, is a fundamental task in many
  machine learning and scientific simulation problems. For high-dimensional eigenvalue
  problems, training neural networks to parameterize the eigenfunctions is considered
  as a promising alternative to the classical numerical linear algebra techniques.
  This paper proposes a new optimization framework based on the low-rank approximation
  characterization of a truncated singular value decomposition, accompanied by new
  techniques called <em>nesting</em> for learning the top-$L$ singular values and
  singular functions in the correct order. The proposed method promotes the desired
  orthogonality in the learned functions implicitly and efficiently via an unconstrained
  optimization formulation, which is easy to solve with off-the-shelf gradient-based
  optimization algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization
  framework for use cases in computational physics and machine learning.
