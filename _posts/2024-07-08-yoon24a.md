title: Uncertainty Estimation by Density Aware Evidential Deep Learning
openreview: JtkruFHcRK
abstract: Evidential deep learning (EDL) has shown remarkable success in uncertainty
  estimation. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in out-of-distribution
  (OOD) detection and classification tasks. The limited OOD detection performance
  of EDL arises from its inability to reflect the distance between the testing example
  and training data when quantifying uncertainty, while its limited classification
  performance stems from its parameterization of the concentration parameters. To
  address these limitations, we propose a novel method called <em>Density Aware Evidential
  Deep Learning (DAEDL)</em>. DAEDL integrates the feature space density of the testing
  example with the output of EDL during the prediction stage, while using a novel
  parameterization that resolves the issues in the conventional parameterization.
  We prove that DAEDL enjoys a number of favorable theoretical properties. DAEDL demonstrates
  state-of-the-art performance across diverse downstream tasks related to uncertainty
  estimation and classification.
