title: Convergence of Some Convex Message Passing Algorithms to a Fixed Point
openreview: CaxQ5IbHgF
abstract: 'A popular approach to the MAP inference problem in graphical models is
  to minimize an upper bound obtained from a dual linear programming or Lagrangian
  relaxation by (block-)coordinate descent. This is also known as convex/convergent
  message passing; examples are max-sum diffusion and sequential tree-reweighted message
  passing (TRW-S). Convergence properties of these methods are currently not fully
  understood. They have been proved to converge to the set characterized by local
  consistency of active constraints, with unknown convergence rate; however, it was
  not clear if the iterates converge at all (to any point). We prove a stronger result
  (conjectured before but never proved): the iterates converge to a fixed point of
  the method. Moreover, we show that the algorithm terminates within $\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon)$
  iterations. We first prove this for a version of coordinate descent applied to a
  general piecewise-affine convex objective. Then we show that several convex message
  passing methods are special cases of this method. Finally, we show that a slightly
  different version of coordinate descent can cycle.'
