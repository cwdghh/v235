title: Unifying Bayesian Flow Networks and Diffusion Models through Stochastic Differential
  Equations
openreview: 1jHiq640y1
abstract: Bayesian flow networks (BFNs) iteratively refine the parameters, instead
  of the samples in diffusion models (DMs), of distributions at various noise levels
  through Bayesian inference. Owing to its differentiable nature, BFNs are promising
  in modeling both continuous and discrete data, while simultaneously maintaining
  fast sampling capabilities. This paper aims to understand and enhance BFNs by connecting
  them with DMs through stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We identify the
  linear SDEs corresponding to the noise-addition processes in BFNs, demonstrate that
  BFNâ€™s regression losses are aligned with denoise score matching, and validate the
  sampler in BFN as a first-order solver for the respective reverse-time SDE. Based
  on these findings and existing recipes of fast sampling in DMs, we propose specialized
  solvers for BFNs that markedly surpass the original BFN sampler in terms of sample
  quality with a limited number of function evaluations (e.g., 10) on both image and
  text datasets. Notably, our best sampler achieves an increase in speed of $5\sim20$
  times for free.
