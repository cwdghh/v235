title: Premise Order Matters in Reasoning with Large Language Models
openreview: 4zAHgkiCQg
abstract: 'Large language models (LLMs) have accomplished remarkable reasoning performance
  in various domains. However, in the domain of reasoning tasks, we discover a frailty:
  LLMs are surprisingly brittle to the ordering of the premises, despite the fact
  that such ordering does not alter the underlying task. In particular, we observe
  that LLMs achieve the best performance when the premise order aligns with the context
  required in intermediate reasoning steps. For example, in deductive reasoning tasks,
  presenting the premises in the same order as the ground truth proof in the prompt
  (as opposed to random ordering) drastically increases the modelâ€™s accuracy. We first
  examine the effect of premise ordering on deductive reasoning on a variety of LLMs,
  and our evaluation shows that even if the model performance is decent on the optimal
  order, permuting the premise order can cause a performance drop of over 30%. In
  addition, we release the benchmark R-GSM, based on GSM8K, to examine the ordering
  effect for mathematical problem-solving, and we again observe a significant drop
  in accuracy, relative to the original GSM8K benchmark.'
