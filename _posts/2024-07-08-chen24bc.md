title: 'One for All: A Universal Generator for Concept Unlearnability via Multi-Modal
  Alignment'
openreview: vSerUPYFtB
abstract: The abundance of free internet data offers unprecedented opportunities for
  researchers and developers, but it also poses privacy risks. Utilizing data without
  explicit consent raises critical challenges in protecting personal information.Unlearnable
  examples have emerged as a feasible protection approach, which renders the data
  unlearnable, i.e., useless to third parties, by injecting imperceptible perturbations.
  However, these perturbations only exhibit unlearnable effects on either a particular
  dataset or label-consistent scenarios, thereby lacking broad applicability. To address
  both issues concurrently, we propose a universal perturbation generator that harnesses
  data with concept unlearnability, thereby broadening the scope of unlearnability
  beyond specific datasets or labels. Specifically, we leverage multi-modal pre-trained
  models to establish a connection between the data concepts in a shared embedding
  space. This connection enables the information transformation from image data to
  text concepts. Consequently, we can align the text embedding using concept-wise
  discriminant loss, and render the data unlearnable. Extensive experiments conducted
  on real-world datasets demonstrate the concept unlearnability, i.e., cross-dataset
  transferability and label-agnostic utility, of our proposed unlearnable examples,
  as well as their robustness against attacks.
