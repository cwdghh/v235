title: 'RIME: Robust Preference-based Reinforcement Learning with Noisy Preferences'
openreview: BxAvcnlS8O
abstract: Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) circumvents the need for
  reward engineering by harnessing human preferences as the reward signal. However,
  current PbRL methods excessively depend on high-quality feedback from domain experts,
  which results in a lack of robustness. In this paper, we present RIME, a robust
  PbRL algorithm for effective reward learning from noisy preferences. Our method
  utilizes a sample selection-based discriminator to dynamically filter out noise
  and ensure robust training. To counteract the cumulative error stemming from incorrect
  selection, we suggest a warm start for the reward model, which additionally bridges
  the performance gap during the transition from pre-training to online training in
  PbRL. Our experiments on robotic manipulation and locomotion tasks demonstrate that
  RIME significantly enhances the robustness of the state-of-the-art PbRL method.
