title: Overcoming Saturation in Density Ratio Estimation by Iterated Regularization
openreview: M407RM0z6h
abstract: Estimating the ratio of two probability densities from finitely many samples,
  is a central task in machine learning and statistics. In this work, we show that
  a large class of kernel methods for density ratio estimation suffers from error
  saturation, which prevents algorithms from achieving fast error convergence rates
  on highly regular learning problems. To resolve saturation, we introduce iterated
  regularization in density ratio estimation to achieve fast error rates. Our methods
  outperform its non-iteratively regularized versions on benchmarks for density ratio
  estimation as well as on large-scale evaluations for importance-weighted ensembling
  of deep unsupervised domain adaptation models.
