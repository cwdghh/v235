title: Amortized Equation Discovery in Hybrid Dynamical Systems
openreview: uqWfZ23O9g
abstract: Hybrid dynamical systems are prevalent in science and engineering to express
  complex systems with continuous and discrete states. To learn laws of systems, all
  previous methods for equation discovery in hybrid systems follow a two-stage paradigm,
  i.e. they first group time series into small cluster fragments and then discover
  equations in each fragment separately through methods in non-hybrid systems. Although
  effective, performance is then limited because these methods ignore the commonalities
  in the shared dynamics of fragments that are driven by the same equations. Besides,
  the two-stage paradigm breaks the interdependence between categorizing and representing
  dynamics that jointly form hybrid systems. In this paper, we reformulate the problem
  and propose an end-to-end learning framework, i.e. Amortized Equation Discovery
  (AMORE), to jointly categorize modes and discover equations characterizing motion
  dynamics of each mode by all segments of the mode. Experiments on four hybrid and
  six non-hybrid systems demonstrate the superior performance of our method against
  previous methods on equation discovery, segmentation, and forecasting.
