title: Classification Under Strategic Self-Selection
openreview: q3Bz1TVTq4
abstract: When users stand to gain from certain predictive outcomes, they are prone
  to act strategically to obtain predictions that are favorable. Most current works
  consider strategic behavior that manifests as users modifying their features; instead,
  we study a novel setting in which users decide whether to even participate (or not),
  this in response to the learned classifier. Considering learning approaches of increasing
  strategic awareness, we investigate the effects of user self-selection on learning,
  and the implications of learning on the composition of the self-selected population.
  Building on this, we propose a differentiable framework for learning under self-selective
  behavior, which can be optimized effectively. We conclude with experiments on real
  data and simulated behavior that complement our analysis and demonstrate the utility
  of our approach.
