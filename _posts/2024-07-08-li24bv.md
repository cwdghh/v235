title: Towards Realistic Model Selection for Semi-supervised Learning
openreview: VoMPNYTZud
abstract: Semi-supervised Learning (SSL) has shown remarkable success in applications
  with limited supervision. However, due to the scarcity of labels in the training
  process, SSL algorithms are known to be impaired by the lack of proper model selection,
  as splitting a validation set will further reduce the limited labeled data, and
  the size of the validation set could be too small to provide a reliable indication
  to the generalization error. Therefore, we seek alternatives that do not rely on
  validation data to probe the generalization performance of SSL models. Specifically,
  we find that the distinct margin distribution in SSL can be effectively utilized
  in conjunction with the modelâ€™s spectral complexity, to provide a non-vacuous indication
  of the generalization error. Built upon this, we propose a novel model selection
  method, specifically tailored for SSL, known as <b>S</b>pectral-normalized <b>La</b>beled-margin
  <b>M</b>inimization (SLAM). We prove that the model selected by SLAM has upper-bounded
  differences w.r.t. the best model within the search space. In addition, comprehensive
  experiments showcase that SLAM can achieve significant improvements compared to
  its counterparts, verifying its efficacy from both theoretical and empirical standpoints.
