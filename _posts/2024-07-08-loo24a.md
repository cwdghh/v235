title: Large Scale Dataset Distillation with Domain Shift
openreview: 0FWPKHMCSc
abstract: Dataset Distillation seeks to summarize a large dataset by generating a
  reduced set of synthetic samples. While there has been much success at distilling
  small datasets such as CIFAR-10 on smaller neural architectures, Dataset Distillation
  methods fail to scale to larger high-resolution datasets and architectures. In this
  work, we introduce <b>D</b>ataset <b>D</b>istillation with <b>D</b>omain <b>S</b>hift
  (<b>D3S</b>), a scalable distillation algorithm, made by reframing the dataset distillation
  problem as a <em>domain shift</em> one. In doing so, we derive a universal bound
  on the distillation loss, and provide a method for efficiently approximately optimizing
  it. We achieve state-of-the-art results on Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet-1k, and ImageNet-21K
  over a variety of recently proposed baselines, including high cross-architecture
  generalization. Additionally, our ablation studies provide lessons on the importance
  of validation-time hyperparameters on distillation performance, motivating the need
  for standardization.
