title: 'Just Cluster It: An Approach for Exploration in High-Dimensions using Clustering
  and Pre-Trained Representations'
openreview: cXBPPfNUZJ
abstract: In this paper we adopt a representation-centric perspective on exploration
  in reinforcement learning, viewing exploration fundamentally as a density estimation
  problem. We investigate the effectiveness of clustering representations for exploration
  in 3-D environments, based on the observation that the importance of pixel changes
  between transitions is less pronounced in 3-D environments compared to 2-D environments,
  where pixel changes between transitions are typically distinct and significant.
  We propose a method that performs episodic and global clustering on random representations
  and on pre-trained DINO representations to count states, i.e, estimate pseudo-counts.
  Surprisingly, even random features can be clustered effectively to count states
  in 3-D environments, however when these become visually more complex, pre-trained
  DINO representations are more effective thanks to the pre-trained inductive biases
  in the representations. Overall, this presents a pathway for integrating pre-trained
  biases into exploration. We evaluate our approach on the VizDoom and Habitat environments,
  demonstrating that our method surpasses other well-known exploration methods in
  these settings.
