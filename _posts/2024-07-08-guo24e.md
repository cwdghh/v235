title: On the Embedding Collapse when Scaling up Recommendation Models
openreview: aPVwOAr1aW
abstract: 'Recent advances in foundation models have led to a promising trend of developing
  large recommendation models to leverage vast amounts of available data. Still, mainstream
  models remain embarrassingly small in size and naive enlarging does not lead to
  sufficient performance gain, suggesting a deficiency in the model scalability. In
  this paper, we identify the embedding collapse phenomenon as the inhibition of scalability,
  wherein the embedding matrix tends to occupy a low-dimensional subspace. Through
  empirical and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate a two-sided effect of feature
  interaction specific to recommendation models. On the one hand, interacting with
  collapsed embeddings restricts embedding learning and exacerbates the collapse issue.
  On the other hand, interaction is crucial in mitigating the fitting of spurious
  features as a scalability guarantee. Based on our analysis, we propose a simple
  yet effective multi-embedding design incorporating embedding-set-specific interaction
  modules to learn embedding sets with large diversity and thus reduce collapse. Extensive
  experiments demonstrate that this proposed design provides consistent scalability
  and effective collapse mitigation for various recommendation models. Code is available
  at this repository: https://github.com/thuml/Multi-Embedding.'
