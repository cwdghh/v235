title: Boundary Exploration for Bayesian Optimization With Unknown Physical Constraints
openreview: fSnMqHZ8xr
abstract: 'Bayesian optimization has been successfully applied to optimize black-box
  functions where the number of evaluations is severely limited. However, in many
  real-world applications, it is hard or impossible to know in advance which designs
  are feasible due to some physical or system limitations. These issues lead to an
  even more challenging problem of optimizing an unknown function with unknown constraints.
  In this paper, we observe that in such scenarios optimal solution typically lies
  on the boundary between feasible and infeasible regions of the design space, making
  it considerably more difficult than that with interior optima. Inspired by this
  observation, we propose BE-CBO, a new Bayesian optimization method that efficiently
  explores the boundary between feasible and infeasible designs. To identify the boundary,
  we learn the constraints with an ensemble of neural networks that outperform the
  standard Gaussian Processes for capturing complex boundaries. Our method demonstrates
  superior performance against state-of-the-art methods through comprehensive experiments
  on synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Code available at: https://github.com/yunshengtian/BE-CBO'
