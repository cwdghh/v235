title: 'Transolver: A Fast Transformer Solver for PDEs on General Geometries'
openreview: Ywl6pODXjB
abstract: Transformers have empowered many milestones across various fields and have
  recently been applied to solve partial differential equations (PDEs). However, since
  PDEs are typically discretized into large-scale meshes with complex geometries,
  it is challenging for Transformers to capture intricate physical correlations directly
  from massive individual points. Going beyond superficial and unwieldy meshes, we
  present Transolver based on a more foundational idea, which is learning intrinsic
  physical states hidden behind discretized geometries. Specifically, we propose a
  new Physics-Attention to adaptively split the discretized domain into a series of
  learnable slices of flexible shapes, where mesh points under similar physical states
  will be ascribed to the same slice. By calculating attention to physics-aware tokens
  encoded from slices, Transovler can effectively capture intricate physical correlations
  under complex geometrics, which also empowers the solver with endogenetic geometry-general
  modeling capacity and can be efficiently computed in linear complexity. Transolver
  achieves consistent state-of-the-art with 22% relative gain across six standard
  benchmarks and also excels in large-scale industrial simulations, including car
  and airfoil designs. Code is available at https://github.com/thuml/Transolver.
