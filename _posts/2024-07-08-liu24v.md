title: 'PAPM: A Physics-aware Proxy Model for Process Systems'
openreview: RtCmp5F9lN
abstract: In the context of proxy modeling for process systems, traditional data-driven
  deep learning approaches frequently encounter significant challenges, such as substantial
  training costs induced by large amounts of data, and limited generalization capabilities.
  As a promising alternative, physics-aware models incorporate partial physics knowledge
  to ameliorate these challenges. Although demonstrating efficacy, they fall short
  in terms of exploration depth and universality. To address these shortcomings, we
  introduce a <b>p</b>hysics-<b>a</b>ware <b>p</b>roxy <b>m</b>odel (<b>PAPM</b>)
  that fully incorporates partial prior physics of process systems, which includes
  multiple input conditions and the general form of conservation relations, resulting
  in better out-of-sample generalization. Additionally, PAPM contains a holistic temporal-spatial
  stepping module for flexible adaptation across various process systems. Through
  systematic comparisons with state-of-the-art pure data-driven and physics-aware
  models across five two-dimensional benchmarks in nine generalization tasks, PAPM
  notably achieves an average performance improvement of 6.7%, while requiring fewer
  FLOPs, and just 1% of the parameters compared to the prior leading method.
