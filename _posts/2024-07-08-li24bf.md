title: 'DiffStitch: Boosting Offline Reinforcement Learning with Diffusion-based Trajectory
  Stitching'
openreview: phGHQOKmaU
abstract: In offline reinforcement learning (RL), the performance of the learned policy
  highly depends on the quality of offline datasets. However, the offline dataset
  contains very limited optimal trajectories in many cases. This poses a challenge
  for offline RL algorithms, as agents must acquire the ability to transit to high-reward
  regions. To address this issue, we introduce Diffusionbased Trajectory Stitching
  (DiffStitch), a novel diffusion-based data augmentation pipeline that systematically
  generates stitching transitions between trajectories. DiffStitch effectively connects
  low-reward trajectories with high-reward trajectories, forming globally optimal
  trajectories and thereby mitigating the challenges faced by offline RL algorithms
  in learning trajectory stitching. Empirical experiments conducted on D4RL datasets
  demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline across RL methodologies. Notably,
  DiffStitch demonstrates substantial enhancements in the performance of one-step
  methods(IQL), imitation learning methods(TD3+BC) and trajectory optimization methods(DT).
