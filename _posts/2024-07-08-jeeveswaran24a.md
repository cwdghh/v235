title: 'Gradual Divergence for Seamless Adaptation: A Novel Domain Incremental Learning
  Method'
openreview: 1AAlMSo7Js
abstract: 'Domain incremental learning (DIL) poses a significant challenge in real-world
  scenarios, as models need to be sequentially trained on diverse domains over time,
  all the while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Mitigating representation drift,
  which refers to the phenomenon of learned representations undergoing changes as
  the model adapts to new tasks, can help alleviate catastrophic forgetting. In this
  study, we propose a novel DIL method named <em>DARE</em>, featuring a three-stage
  training process: Divergence, Adaptation, and REfinement. This process gradually
  adapts the representations associated with new tasks into the feature space spanned
  by samples from previous tasks, simultaneously integrating task-specific decision
  boundaries. Additionally, we introduce a novel strategy for buffer sampling and
  demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, combined with this sampling
  strategy, in reducing representation drift within the feature encoder. This contribution
  effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting across multiple DIL benchmarks. Furthermore,
  our approach prevents sudden representation drift at task boundaries, resulting
  in a well-calibrated DIL model that maintains the performance on previous tasks.'
