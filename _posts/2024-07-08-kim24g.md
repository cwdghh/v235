title: Active Label Correction for Semantic Segmentation with Foundation Models
openreview: WPt9HRmMrG
abstract: 'Training and validating models for semantic segmentation require datasets
  with pixel-wise annotations, which are notoriously labor-intensive. Although useful
  priors such as foundation models or crowdsourced datasets are available, they are
  error-prone. We hence propose an effective framework of active label correction
  (ALC) based on a design of correction query to rectify pseudo labels of pixels,
  which in turn is more annotator-friendly than the standard one inquiring to classify
  a pixel directly according to our theoretical analysis and user study. Specifically,
  leveraging foundation models providing useful zero-shot predictions on pseudo labels
  and superpixels, our method comprises two key techniques: (i) an annotator-friendly
  design of correction query with the pseudo labels, and (ii) an acquisition function
  looking ahead label expansions based on the superpixels. Experimental results on
  PASCAL, Cityscapes, and Kvasir-SEG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
  ALC framework, outperforming prior methods for active semantic segmentation and
  label correction. Notably, utilizing our method, we obtained a revised dataset of
  PASCAL by rectifying errors in 2.6 million pixels in PASCAL dataset.'
