title: Translating Subgraphs to Nodes Makes Simple GNNs Strong and Efficient for Subgraph
  Representation Learning
openreview: xSizvCoI79
abstract: Subgraph representation learning has emerged as an important problem, but
  it is by default approached with specialized graph neural networks on a large global
  graph. These models demand extensive memory and computational resources but challenge
  modeling hierarchical structures of subgraphs. In this paper, we propose Subgraph-To-Node
  (S2N) translation, a novel formulation for learning representations of subgraphs.
  Specifically, given a set of subgraphs in the global graph, we construct a new graph
  by coarsely transforming subgraphs into nodes. Demonstrating both theoretical and
  empirical evidence, S2N not only significantly reduces memory and computational
  costs compared to state-of-the-art models but also outperforms them by capturing
  both local and global structures of the subgraph. By leveraging graph coarsening
  methods, our method outperforms baselines even in a data-scarce setting with insufficient
  subgraphs. Our experiments on eight benchmarks demonstrate that fined-tuned models
  with S2N translation can process 183 â€“ 711 times more subgraph samples than state-of-the-art
  models at a better or similar performance level.
