title: 'From Coarse to Fine: Enable Comprehensive Graph Self-supervised Learning with
  Multi-granular Semantic Ensemble'
openreview: JnA9IveEwg
abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has gained increasing attention in the graph
  learning community, owing to its capability of enabling powerful models pre-trained
  on large unlabeled graphs for general purposes, facilitating quick adaptation to
  specific domains. Though promising, existing graph SSL frameworks often struggle
  to capture both high-level abstract features and fine-grained features simultaneously,
  leading to sub-optimal generalization abilities across different downstream tasks.
  To bridge this gap, we present Multi-granularity Graph Semantic Ensemble via Knowledge
  Distillation, namely MGSE, a plug-and-play graph knowledge distillation framework
  that can be applied to any existing graph SSL framework to enhance its performance
  by incorporating the concept of multi-granularity. Specifically, MGSE captures multi-granular
  knowledge by employing multiple student models to learn from a single teacher model,
  conditioned by probability distributions with different granularities. We apply
  it to six state-of-the-art graph SSL frameworks and evaluate their performances
  over multiple graph datasets across different domains, the experimental results
  show that MGSE can consistently boost the performance of these existing graph SSL
  frameworks with up to 9.2% improvement.
