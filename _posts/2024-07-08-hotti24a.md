title: Efficient Mixture Learning in Black-Box Variational Inference
openreview: Grrydzui3A
abstract: Mixture variational distributions in black box variational inference (BBVI)
  have demonstrated impressive results in challenging density estimation tasks. However,
  currently scaling the number of mixture components can lead to a linear increase
  in the number of learnable parameters and a quadratic increase in inference time
  due to the evaluation of the evidence lower bound (ELBO). Our two key contributions
  address these limitations. First, we introduce the novel Multiple Importance Sampling
  Variational Autoencoder (MISVAE), which amortizes the mapping from input to mixture-parameter
  space using one-hot encodings. Fortunately, with MISVAE, each additional mixture
  component incurs a negligible increase in network parameters. Second, we construct
  two new estimators of the ELBO for mixtures in BBVI, enabling a tremendous reduction
  in inference time with marginal or even improved impact on performance. Collectively,
  our contributions enable scalability to hundreds of mixture components and provide
  superior estimation performance in shorter time, with fewer network parameters compared
  to previous Mixture VAEs. Experimenting with MISVAE, we achieve astonishing, SOTA
  results on MNIST. Furthermore, we empirically validate our estimators in other BBVI
  settings, including Bayesian phylogenetic inference, where we improve inference
  times for the SOTA mixture model on eight data sets.
