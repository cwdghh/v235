title: Latent Optimal Paths by Gumbel Propagation for Variational Bayesian Dynamic
  Programming
openreview: VSwrXRqD9o
abstract: 'We propose the stochastic optimal path which solves the classical optimal
  path problem by a probability-softening solution. This unified approach transforms
  a wide range of DP problems into directed acyclic graphs in which all paths follow
  a Gibbs distribution. We show the equivalence of the Gibbs distribution to a message-passing
  algorithm by the properties of the Gumbel distribution and give all the ingredients
  required for variational Bayesian inference of a latent path, namely Bayesian dynamic
  programming (BDP). We demonstrate the usage of BDP in the latent space of variational
  autoencoders (VAEs) and propose the BDP-VAE which captures structured sparse optimal
  paths as latent variables. This enables end-to-end training for generative tasks
  in which models rely on unobserved structural information. At last, we validate
  the behavior of our approach and showcase its applicability in two real-world applications:
  text-to-speech and singing voice synthesis. Our implementation code is available
  at https://github.com/XinleiNIU/LatentOptimalPathsBayesianDP.'
