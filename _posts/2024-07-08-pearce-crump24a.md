title: Graph Automorphism Group Equivariant Neural Networks
openreview: vjkq5fwsj3
abstract: Permutation equivariant neural networks are typically used to learn from
  data that lives on a graph. However, for any graph $G$ that has $n$ vertices, using
  the symmetric group $S_n$ as its group of symmetries does not take into account
  the relations that exist between the vertices. Given that the actual group of symmetries
  is the automorphism group Aut$(G)$, we show how to construct neural networks that
  are equivariant to Aut$(G)$ by obtaining a full characterisation of the learnable,
  linear, Aut$(G)$-equivariant functions between layers that are some tensor power
  of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. In particular, we find a spanning set of matrices for these
  layer functions in the standard basis of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. This result has important
  consequences for learning from data whose group of symmetries is a finite group
  because a theorem by Frucht (1938) showed that any finite group is isomorphic to
  the automorphism group of a graph.
