title: 'CrossGET: Cross-Guided Ensemble of Tokens for Accelerating Vision-Language
  Transformers'
openreview: CSIfCpXhCF
abstract: 'Recent vision-language models have achieved tremendous advances. However,
  their computational costs are also escalating dramatically, making model acceleration
  exceedingly critical. To pursue more efficient vision-language Transformers, this
  paper introduces Cross-Guided Ensemble of Tokens (CrossGET), a general acceleration
  framework for vision-language Transformers. This framework adaptively combines tokens
  in real-time during inference, significantly reducing computational costs while
  maintaining high performance. CrossGET features two primary innovations: 1) Cross-Guided
  Matching and Ensemble. CrossGET leverages cross-modal guided token matching and
  ensemble to effectively utilize cross-modal information, achieving wider applicability
  across both modality-independent models, e.g., CLIP, and modality-dependent ones,
  e.g., BLIP2. 2) Complete-Graph Soft Matching. CrossGET introduces an algorithm for
  the token-matching mechanism, ensuring reliable matching results while facilitating
  parallelizability and high efficiency. Extensive experiments have been conducted
  on various vision-language tasks, such as image-text retrieval, visual reasoning,
  image captioning, and visual question answering. The performance on both classic
  multimodal architectures and emerging multimodal LLMs demonstrates the frameworkâ€™s
  effectiveness and versatility. The code is available at https://github.com/sdc17/CrossGET.'
