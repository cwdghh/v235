title: Transitional Uncertainty with Layered Intermediate Predictions
openreview: zII3Olw7cr
abstract: 'In this paper, we discuss feature engineering for single-pass uncertainty
  estimation. For accurate uncertainty estimates, neural networks must extract differences
  in the feature space that quantify uncertainty. This could be achieved by current
  single-pass approaches that maintain feature distances between data points as they
  traverse the network. While initial results are promising, maintaining feature distances
  within the network representations frequently inhibits information compression and
  opposes the learning objective. We study this effect theoretically and empirically
  to arrive at a simple conclusion: preserving feature distances in the output is
  beneficial when the preserved features contribute to learning the label distribution
  and act in opposition otherwise. We then propose Transitional Uncertainty with Layered
  Intermediate Predictions (TULIP) as a simple approach to address the shortcomings
  of current single-pass estimators. Specifically, we implement feature preservation
  by extracting features from intermediate representations before information is collapsed
  by subsequent layers. We refer to the underlying preservation mechanism as transitional
  feature preservation. We show that TULIP matches or outperforms current single-pass
  methods on standard benchmarks and in practical settings where these methods are
  less reliable (imbalances, complex architectures, medical modalities).'
