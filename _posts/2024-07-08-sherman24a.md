title: Rate-Optimal Policy Optimization for Linear Markov Decision Processes
openreview: VJwsDwuiuH
abstract: We study regret minimization in online episodic linear Markov Decision Processes,
  and propose a policy optimization algorithm that is computationally efficient, and
  obtains rate optimal $\widetilde O (\sqrt K)$ regret where $K$ denotes the number
  of episodes. Our work is the first to establish the optimal rate (in terms of $K$)
  of convergence in the stochastic setting with bandit feedback using a policy optimization
  based approach, and the first to establish the optimal rate in the adversarial setup
  with full information feedback, for which no algorithm with an optimal rate guarantee
  was previously known.
