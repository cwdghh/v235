title: Randomized Confidence Bounds for Stochastic Partial Monitoring
openreview: x0vLj1S6Wg
abstract: The partial monitoring (PM) framework provides a theoretical formulation
  of sequential learning problems with incomplete feedback. At each round, a learning
  agent plays an action while the environment simultaneously chooses an outcome. The
  agent then observes a feedback signal that is only partially informative about the
  (unobserved) outcome. The agent leverages the received feedback signals to select
  actions that minimize the (unobserved) cumulative loss. In contextual PM, the outcomes
  depend on some side information that is observable by the agent before selecting
  the action. In this paper, we consider the contextual and non-contextual PM settings
  with stochastic outcomes. We introduce a new class of PM strategies based on the
  randomization of deterministic confidence bounds. We also extend regret guarantees
  to settings where existing stochastic strategies are not applicable. Our experiments
  show that the proposed RandCBP and RandCBPside* strategies have competitive performance
  against state-of-the-art baselines in multiple PM games. To illustrate how the PM
  framework can benefit real world applications, we design a use case on the real-world
  problem of monitoring the error rate of any deployed classification system.
