title: Collective Certified Robustness against Graph Injection Attacks
openreview: DhxZVq1ZOo
abstract: We investigate certified robustness for GNNs under graph injection attacks.
  Existing research only provides sample-wise certificates by verifying each node
  independently, leading to very limited certifying performance. In this paper, we
  present the first collective certificate, which certifies a set of target nodes
  simultaneously. To achieve it, we formulate the problem as a binary integer quadratic
  constrained linear programming (BQCLP). We further develop a customized linearization
  technique that allows us to relax the BQCLP into linear programming (LP) that can
  be efficiently solved. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our
  collective certification scheme significantly improves certification performance
  with minimal computational overhead. For instance, by solving the LP within 1 minute
  on the Citeseer dataset, we achieve a significant increase in the certified ratio
  from 0.0% to 81.2% when the injected node number is 5% of the graph size. Our paper
  marks a crucial step towards making provable defense more practical. Our source
  code is available at https://github.com/Yuni-Lai/CollectiveLPCert.
