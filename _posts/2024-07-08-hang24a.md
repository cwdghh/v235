title: 'Binary Decomposition: A Problem Transformation Perspective for Open-Set Semi-Supervised
  Learning'
openreview: Irkcamqg4d
abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a classical machine learning paradigm
  dealing with labeled and unlabeled data. However, it often suffers performance degradation
  in real-world open-set scenarios, where unlabeled data contains outliers from novel
  categories that do not appear in labeled data. Existing studies commonly tackle
  this challenging open-set SSL problem with detect-and-filter strategy, which attempts
  to purify unlabeled data by detecting and filtering outliers. In this paper, we
  propose a novel binary decomposition strategy, which refrains from error-prone procedure
  of outlier detection by directly transforming the original open-set SSL problem
  into a number of standard binary SSL problems. Accordingly, a concise yet effective
  approach named BDMatch is presented. BDMatch confronts two attendant issues brought
  by binary decomposition, i.e. class-imbalance and representation-compromise, with
  adaptive logit adjustment and label-specific feature learning respectively. Comprehensive
  experiments on diversified benchmarks clearly validate the superiority of BDMatch
  as well as the effectiveness of our binary decomposition strategy.
