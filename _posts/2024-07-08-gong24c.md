title: 'AST-T5: Structure-Aware Pretraining for Code Generation and Understanding'
openreview: cBWVJh5Fvf
abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in code-related
  tasks, yet many LLMs treat code as simple sequences, neglecting its structured nature.
  We introduce AST-T5, a novel pretraining paradigm that leverages the Abstract Syntax
  Tree (AST) for enhanced code generation, transpilation, and understanding. Using
  dynamic programming, our AST-Aware Segmentation retains code structure, while our
  AST-Aware Span Corruption objective equips the model to reconstruct various code
  structures. Unlike other models, AST-T5 avoids complex program analyses or architectural
  changes, so it integrates seamlessly with any encoder-decoder Transformer. Evaluations
  show that AST-T5 consistently outperforms similar-sized LMs across various code-related
  tasks including HumanEval and MBPP. Structure-awareness makes AST-T5 particularly
  powerful in code-to-code tasks, surpassing CodeT5 by 2 points in exact match score
  for the Bugs2Fix task and by 3 points in exact match score for Java-C# Transpilation
  in CodeXGLUE. Our code and model are publicly available at https://github.com/gonglinyuan/ast_t5.
