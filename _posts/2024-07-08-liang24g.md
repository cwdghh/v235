title: 'Scalable Multiple Kernel Clustering: Learning Clustering Structure from Expectation'
openreview: l5lgbVR6BP
abstract: In this paper, we derive an upper bound of the difference between a kernel
  matrix and its expectation under a mild assumption. Specifically, we assume that
  the true distribution of the training data is an unknown isotropic Gaussian distribution.
  When the kernel function is a Gaussian kernel, and the mean of each cluster is sufficiently
  separated, we find that the expectation of a kernel matrix can be close to a rank-$k$
  matrix, where $k$ is the cluster number. Moreover, we prove that the normalized
  kernel matrix of the training set deviates (w.r.t. Frobenius norm) from its expectation
  in the order of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{d})$, where $d$ is the dimension
  of samples. Based on the above theoretical results, we propose a novel multiple
  kernel clustering framework which attempts to learn the information of the expectation
  kernel matrices. First, we aim to minimize the distance between each base kernel
  and a rank-$k$ matrix, which is a proxy of the expectation kernel. Then, we fuse
  these rank-$k$ matrices into a consensus rank-$k$ matrix to find the clustering
  structure. Using an anchor-based method, the proposed framework is flexible with
  the sizes of input kernel matrices and able to handle large-scale datasets. We also
  provide the approximation guarantee by deriving two non-asymptotic bounds for the
  consensus kernel and clustering indicator matrices. Finally, we conduct extensive
  experiments to verify the clustering performance of the proposed method and the
  correctness of the proposed theoretical results.
