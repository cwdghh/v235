title: 'Reservoir Computing for Short High-Dimensional Time Series: an Application
  to SARS-CoV-2 Hospitalization Forecast'
openreview: CY0lFwD4qx
abstract: 'In this work, we aimed at forecasting the number of SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized
  patients at 14 days to help anticipate the bed requirements of a large scale hospital
  using public data and electronic health records data. Previous attempts led to mitigated
  performance in this high-dimension setting; we introduce a novel approach to time
  series forecasting by providing an alternative to conventional methods to deal with
  high number of potential features of interest (409 predictors). We integrate Reservoir
  Computing (RC) with feature selection using a genetic algorithm (GA) to gather optimal
  non-linear combinations of inputs to improve prediction in sample-efficient context.
  We illustrate that the RC-GA combination exhibits excellent performance in forecasting
  SARS-CoV-2 hospitalizations. This approach outperformed the use of RC alone and
  other conventional methods: LSTM, Transformers, Elastic-Net, XGBoost. Notably, this
  work marks the pioneering use of RC (along with GA) in the realm of short and high-dimensional
  time series, positioning it as a competitive and innovative approach in comparison
  to standard methods.'
