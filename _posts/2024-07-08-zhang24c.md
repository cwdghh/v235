title: 'SAM-E: Leveraging Visual Foundation Model with Sequence Imitation for Embodied
  Manipulation'
openreview: ryDa4mS18V
abstract: Acquiring a multi-task imitation policy in 3D manipulation poses challenges
  in terms of scene understanding and action prediction. Current methods employ both
  3D representation and multi-view 2D representation to predict the poses of the robotâ€™s
  end-effector. However, they still require a considerable amount of high-quality
  robot trajectories, and suffer from limited generalization in unseen tasks and inefficient
  execution in long-horizon reasoning. In this paper, we propose <b>SAM-E</b>, a novel
  architecture for robot manipulation by leveraging a vision-foundation model for
  generalizable scene understanding and sequence imitation for long-term action reasoning.
  Specifically, we adopt Segment Anything (SAM) pre-trained on a huge number of images
  and promptable masks as the foundation model for extracting task-relevant features,
  and employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning on robot data for a better understanding
  of embodied scenarios. To address long-horizon reasoning, we develop a novel multi-channel
  heatmap that enables the prediction of the action sequence in a single pass, notably
  enhancing execution efficiency. Experimental results from various instruction-following
  tasks demonstrate that SAM-E achieves superior performance with higher execution
  efficiency compared to the baselines, and also significantly improves generalization
  in few-shot adaptation to new tasks.
