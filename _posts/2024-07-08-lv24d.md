title: Efficient and Effective Time-Series Forecasting with Spiking Neural Networks
openreview: SkI6u81AkI
abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), inspired by the spiking behavior of biological
  neurons, provide a unique pathway for capturing the intricacies of temporal data.
  However, applying SNNs to time-series forecasting is challenging due to difficulties
  in effective temporal alignment, complexities in encoding processes, and the absence
  of standardized guidelines for model selection. In this paper, we propose a framework
  for SNNs in time-series forecasting tasks, leveraging the efficiency of spiking
  neurons in processing temporal information. Through a series of experiments, we
  demonstrate that our proposed SNN-based approaches achieve comparable or superior
  results to traditional time-series forecasting methods on diverse benchmarks with
  much less energy consumption. Furthermore, we conduct detailed analysis experiments
  to assess the SNNâ€™s capacity to capture temporal dependencies within time-series
  data, offering valuable insights into its nuanced strengths and effectiveness in
  modeling the intricate dynamics of temporal data. Our study contributes to the expanding
  field of SNNs and offers a promising alternative for time-series forecasting tasks,
  presenting a pathway for the development of more biologically inspired and temporally
  aware forecasting models. Our code is available at https://github.com/microsoft/SeqSNN.
