title: 'EvoRainbow: Combining Improvements in Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning
  for Policy Search'
openreview: 75Hes6Zse4
abstract: 'Both Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) have
  demonstrated powerful capabilities in policy search with different principles. A
  promising direction is to combine the respective strengths of both for efficient
  policy optimization. To this end, many works have proposed various mechanisms to
  integrate EAs and RL. However, it is still unclear which of these mechanisms are
  complementary and can be fully combined. In this paper, we revisit different mechanisms
  from five perspectives: 1) Interaction Mode, 2) Individual Architecture, 3) EAs
  and operators, 4) Impact of EA on RL, and 5) Fitness Surrogate and Usage. We evaluate
  the effectiveness of each mechanism and experimentally analyze the reasons for the
  more effective mechanisms. Using the most effective mechanisms, we develop EvoRainbow
  and EvoRainbow-Exp, which outperform strong baselines and provide state-of-the-art
  performance across various tasks with distinct characteristics. To promote community
  development, we release the code on https://github.com/yeshenpy/EvoRainbow.'
