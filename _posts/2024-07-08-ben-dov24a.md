title: The Role of Learning Algorithms in Collective Action
openreview: Ez3Lckpe4l
abstract: Collective action in machine learning is the study of the control that a
  coordinated group can have over machine learning algorithms. While previous research
  has concentrated on assessing the impact of collectives against Bayes (sub-)optimal
  classifiers, this perspective is limited in that it does not account for the choice
  of learning algorithm. Since classifiers seldom behave like Bayes classifiers and
  are influenced by the choice of learning algorithms along with their inherent biases,
  in this work we initiate the study of how the choice of the learning algorithm plays
  a role in the success of a collective in practical settings. Specifically, we focus
  on distributionally robust optimization (DRO), popular for improving a worst group
  error, and on the ubiquitous stochastic gradient descent (SGD), due to its inductive
  bias for "simpler" functions. Our empirical results, supported by a theoretical
  foundation, show that the effective size and success of the collective are highly
  dependent on properties of the learning algorithm. This highlights the necessity
  of taking the learning algorithm into account when studying the impact of collective
  action in machine learning.
