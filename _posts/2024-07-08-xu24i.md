title: Practical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo on Riemannian Manifolds via Relativity Theory
openreview: Et8Pk97u4u
abstract: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) samples from an unnormalized density by numerically
  integrating Hamiltonian dynamics. Girolami & Calderhead (2011) extend HMC to Riemannian
  manifolds, but the resulting method faces integration instability issues for practical
  usage. While previous works have tackled this challenge by using more robust metric
  tensors than Fisherâ€™s information metric, our work focuses on designing numerically
  stable Hamiltonian dynamics. To do so, we start with the idea from Lu et al. (2017),
  which designs momentum distributions to upper-bound the particle speed. Then, we
  generalize this Lu et al. (2017) method to Riemannian manifolds. In our generalization,
  the upper bounds of velocity norm become position-dependent, which intrinsically
  limits step sizes used in high curvature regions and, therefore, significantly reduces
  numerical errors. We also derive a more tractable algorithm to sample from relativistic
  momentum distributions without relying on the mean-field assumption.
