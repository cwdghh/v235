title: 'FAFE: Immune Complex Modeling with Geodesic Distance Loss on Noisy Group Frames'
openreview: Lhb39btw16
abstract: Despite the striking success of general protein folding models such as AlphaFold2
  (AF2), the accurate computational modeling of antibody-antigen complexes remains
  a challenging task. In this paper, we first analyze AF2â€™s primary loss function,
  known as the Frame Aligned Point Error (FAPE), and raise a previously overlooked
  issue that FAPE tends to face gradient vanishing problem on high-rotational-error
  targets. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose a novel geodesic loss
  called Frame Aligned Frame Error (FAFE, denoted as F2E to distinguish from FAPE),
  which enables the model to better optimize both the rotational and translational
  errors between two frames. We then prove that F2E can be reformulated as a group-aware
  geodesic loss, which translates the optimization of the residue-to-residue error
  to optimizing group-to-group geodesic frame distance. By fine-tuning AF2 with our
  proposed new loss function, we attain a correct rate of 52.3% (DockQ $>$ 0.23) on
  an evaluation set and 43.8% correct rate on a subset with low homology, with improvement
  over AF2 by 182% and 100% respectively.
