title: Rapid Learning without Catastrophic Forgetting in the Morris Water Maze
openreview: i9C4Kwm56G
abstract: Animals can swiftly adapt to novel tasks, while maintaining proficiency
  on previously trained tasks. This contrasts starkly with machine learning models,
  which struggle on these capabilities. We first propose a new task, the sequential
  Morris Water Maze (sWM), which extends a widely used task in the psychology and
  neuroscience fields and requires both rapid and continual learning. It has frequently
  been hypothesized that inductive biases from brains could help build better ML systems,
  but the addition of constraints typically hurts rather than helping ML performance.
  We draw inspiration from biology to show that combining 1) a content-addressable
  heteroassociative memory based on the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit with grid cells
  that retain shared across-environment structural representations and hippocampal
  cells that acquire environment-specific information; 2) a spatially invariant convolutional
  network architecture for rapid adaptation across unfamiliar environments; and 3)
  the ability to perform remapping, which orthogonalizes internal representations;
  leads to good generalization, rapid learning, and continual learning without forgetting,
  respectively. Our model outperforms ANN baselines from continual learning contexts
  applied to the task. It retains knowledge of past environments while rapidly acquiring
  the skills to navigate new ones, thereby addressing the seemingly opposing challenges
  of quick knowledge transfer and sustaining proficiency in previously learned tasks.
  These biologically motivated results may point the way toward ML algorithms with
  similar properties.
