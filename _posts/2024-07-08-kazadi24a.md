title: Pluvial Flood Emulation with Hydraulics-informed Message Passing
openreview: kIHIA6Lr0B
abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a promising alternative to numerical
  methods for physics-based simulation due to its flexibility and efficiency. Flood
  modeling is a key case study for ML-based simulation due to its relevance as a tool
  for supporting preventive and emergency measures to mitigate flood risks. However,
  the complexity of the topography or domain (ground elevation) and the sparsity of
  the time-evolving precipitations (external forcing) can be challenging for most
  existing ML approaches for simulating flooding processes in space and time. Another
  critical challenge is incorporating physics domain knowledge (hydraulics) into these
  data-driven models. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a hydraulics-informed
  graph neural network for flood simulation. Given a (geographical) region and precipitation
  data, our model predicts water depths in an auto-regressive fashion. We propose
  a message-passing framework inspired by the conservation of momentum and mass expressed
  in the shallow-water equations, which describe the physical process of a flooding
  event. Empirical results on a dataset covering 9 regions and 7 historical precipitation
  events demonstrate that our model outperforms the best baseline, and can capture
  the propagation of water flow more effectively, especially at the very early stage
  of the flooding event when the amount of water in the domain is scarce. Differently
  from some of the most recent methods for ML-based simulation, which tend to work
  well only when the domain is a smooth surface (e.g., flat terrain), we show that
  our solution achieves accurate results for real ground elevation data.
