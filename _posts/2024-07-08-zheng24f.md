title: 'Characteristic Guidance: Non-linear Correction for Diffusion Model at Large
  Guidance Scale'
openreview: eOtjMYdGLt
abstract: Popular guidance for denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) linearly
  combines distinct conditional models together to provide enhanced control over samples.
  However, this approach overlooks nonlinear effects that become significant when
  guidance scale is large. To address this issue, we propose characteristic guidance,
  a guidance method that provides first-principle non-linear correction for classifier-free
  guidance. Such correction forces the guided DDPMs to respect the Fokker-Planck (FP)
  equation of diffusion process, in a way that is training-free and compatible with
  existing sampling methods. Experiments show that characteristic guidance enhances
  semantic characteristics of prompts and mitigate irregularities in image generation,
  proving effective in diverse applications ranging from simulating magnet phase transitions
  to latent space sampling.
