title: A Distributional Analogue to the Successor Representation
openreview: zajsXCxMgW
abstract: This paper contributes a new approach for distributional reinforcement learning
  which elucidates a clean separation of transition structure and reward in the learning
  process. Analogous to how the successor representation (SR) describes the expected
  consequences of behaving according to a given policy, our distributional successor
  measure (SM) describes the distributional consequences of this behaviour. We formulate
  the distributional SM as a distribution over distributions and provide theory connecting
  it with distributional and model-based reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose
  an algorithm that learns the distributional SM from data by minimizing a two-level
  maximum mean discrepancy. Key to our method are a number of algorithmic techniques
  that are independently valuable for learning generative models of state. As an illustration
  of the usefulness of the distributional SM, we show that it enables zero-shot risk-sensitive
  policy evaluation in a way that was not previously possible.
