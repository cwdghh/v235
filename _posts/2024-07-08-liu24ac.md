title: Weakly-Supervised Residual Evidential Learning for Multi-Instance Uncertainty
  Estimation
openreview: cxiqxDnrCx
abstract: Uncertainty estimation (UE), as an effective means of quantifying predictive
  uncertainty, is crucial for safe and reliable decision-making, especially in high-risk
  scenarios. Existing UE schemes usually assume that there are completely-labeled
  samples to support fully-supervised learning. In practice, however, many UE tasks
  often have no sufficiently-labeled data to use, such as the Multiple Instance Learning
  (MIL) with only weak instance annotations. To bridge this gap, this paper, for the
  first time, addresses the weakly-supervised issue of <em>Multi-Instance UE</em>
  (MIUE) and proposes a new baseline scheme, <em>Multi-Instance Residual Evidential
  Learning</em> (MIREL). Particularly, at the fine-grained instance UE with only weak
  supervision, we derive a multi-instance residual operator through the Fundamental
  Theorem of Symmetric Functions. On this operator derivation, we further propose
  MIREL to jointly model the high-order predictive distribution at bag and instance
  levels for MIUE. Extensive experiments empirically demonstrate that our MIREL not
  only could often make existing MIL networks perform better in MIUE, but also could
  surpass representative UE methods by large margins, especially in instance-level
  UE tasks. Our source code is available at https://github.com/liupei101/MIREL.
