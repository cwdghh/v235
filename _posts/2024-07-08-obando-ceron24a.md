title: In value-based deep reinforcement learning, a pruned network is a good network
openreview: seo9V9QRZp
abstract: Recent work has shown that deep reinforcement learning agents have difficulty
  in effectively using their network parameters. We leverage prior insights into the
  advantages of sparse training techniques and demonstrate that gradual magnitude
  pruning enables value-based agents to maximize parameter effectiveness. This results
  in networks that yield dramatic performance improvements over traditional networks,
  using only a small fraction of the full network parameters. Our code is publicly
  available, see Appendix A for details.
