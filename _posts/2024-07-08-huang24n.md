title: 'CLIF: Complementary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron for Spiking Neural Networks'
openreview: yY6N89IlHa
abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are promising brain-inspired energy-efficient
  models. Compared to conventional deep Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), SNNs exhibit
  superior efficiency and capability to process temporal information. However, it
  remains a challenge to train SNNs due to their undifferentiable spiking mechanism.
  The surrogate gradients method is commonly used to train SNNs, but often comes with
  an accuracy disadvantage over ANNs counterpart. We link the degraded accuracy to
  the vanishing of gradient on the temporal dimension through the analytical and experimental
  study of the training process of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Neuron-based SNNs.
  Moreover, we propose the Complementary Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (CLIF) Neuron. CLIF
  creates extra paths to facilitate the backpropagation in computing temporal gradient
  while keeping binary output. CLIF is hyperparameter-free and features broad applicability.
  Extensive experiments on a variety of datasets demonstrate CLIF’s clear performance
  advantage over other neuron models. Furthermore, the CLIF’s performance even slightly
  surpasses superior ANNs with identical network structure and training conditions.
