title: Let Go of Your Labels with Unsupervised Transfer
openreview: RZHRnnGcEx
abstract: Foundation vision-language models have enabled remarkable zero-shot transferability
  of the pre-trained representations to a wide range of downstream tasks. However,
  to solve a new task, zero-shot transfer still necessitates human guidance to define
  visual categories that appear in the data. Here, we show that fully unsupervised
  transfer emerges when searching for the labeling of a dataset that induces maximal
  margin classifiers in representation spaces of different foundation models. We present
  TURTLE, a fully unsupervised method that effectively employs this guiding principle
  to uncover the underlying labeling of a downstream dataset without any supervision
  and task-specific representation learning. We evaluate TURTLE on a diverse benchmark
  suite of 26 datasets and show that it achieves new state-of-the-art unsupervised
  performance. Furthermore, TURTLE, although being fully unsupervised, outperforms
  zero-shot transfer baselines on a wide range of datasets. In particular, TURTLE
  matches the average performance of CLIP zero-shot on 26 datasets by employing the
  same representation space, spanning a wide range of architectures and model sizes.
  By guiding the search for the underlying labeling using the representation spaces
  of two foundation models, TURTLE surpasses zero-shot transfer and unsupervised prompt
  tuning baselines, demonstrating the surprising power and effectiveness of unsupervised
  transfer.
