title: Scalable AI Safety via Doubly-Efficient Debate
openreview: 6jmdOTRMIO
abstract: The emergence of pre-trained AI systems with powerful capabilities across
  a diverse and ever-increasing set of complex domains has raised a critical challenge
  for AI safety as tasks can become too complicated for humans to judge directly.
  Irving et al (2018). proposed a debate method in this direction with the goal of
  pitting the power of such AI models against each other until the problem of identifying
  (mis)-alignment is broken down into a manageable subtask. While the promise of this
  approach is clear, the original framework was based on the assumption that the honest
  strategy is able to simulate <em>deterministic</em> AI systems for an <em>exponential</em>
  number of steps, limiting its applicability. In this paper, we show how to address
  these challenges by designing a new set of debate protocols where the honest strategy
  can always succeed using a simulation of a <em>polynomial</em> number of steps,
  whilst being able to verify the alignment of <em>stochastic</em> AI systems, even
  when the dishonest strategy is allowed to use exponentially many simulation steps.
