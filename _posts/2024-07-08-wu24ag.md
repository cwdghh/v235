title: 'HGCN2SP: Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Network for Two-Stage Stochastic
  Programming'
openreview: 8onaVSFTEj
abstract: Two-stage Stochastic Programming (2SP) is a standard framework for modeling
  decision-making problems under uncertainty. While numerous methods exist, solving
  such problems with many scenarios remains challenging. Selecting representative
  scenarios is a practical method for accelerating solutions. However, current approaches
  typically rely on clustering or Monte Carlo sampling, failing to integrate scenario
  information deeply and overlooking the significant impact of the scenario order
  on solving time. To address these issues, we develop HGCN2SP, a novel model with
  a hierarchical graph designed for 2SP problems, encoding each scenario and modeling
  their relationships hierarchically. The model is trained in a reinforcement learning
  paradigm to utilize the feedback of the solver. The policy network is equipped with
  a hierarchical graph convolutional network for feature encoding and an attention-based
  decoder for scenario selection in proper order. Evaluation of two classic 2SP problems
  demonstrates that HGCN2SP provides high-quality decisions in a short computational
  time. Furthermore, HGCN2SP exhibits remarkable generalization capabilities in handling
  large-scale instances, even with a substantial number of variables or scenarios
  that were unseen during the training phase.
