title: 'Causal Inference out of Control: Estimating Performativity without Treatment
  Randomization'
openreview: Bb8pOvWIe4
abstract: Regulators and academics are increasingly interested in the causal effect
  that algorithmic actions of a digital platform have on user consumption. In pursuit
  of estimating this effect from observational data, we identify a set of assumptions
  that permit causal identifiability without assuming randomized platform actions.
  Our results are applicable to platforms that rely on machine-learning-powered predictions
  and leverage knowledge from historical data. The key novelty of our approach is
  to explicitly model the dynamics of consumption over time, exploiting the repeated
  interaction of digital platforms with their participants to prove our identifiability
  results. By viewing the platform as a controller acting on a dynamical system, we
  can show that exogenous variation in consumption and appropriately responsive algorithmic
  control actions are sufficient for identifying the causal effect of interest. We
  complement our claims with an analysis of ready-to-use finite sample estimators
  and empirical investigations. More broadly, our results deriving identifiability
  conditions tailored to digital platform settings illustrate a fruitful interplay
  of control theory and causal inference.
