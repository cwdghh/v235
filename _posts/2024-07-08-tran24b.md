title: Inferring the Long-Term Causal Effects of Long-Term Treatments from Short-Term
  Experiments
openreview: lQ2o7JteMO
abstract: We study inference on the long-term causal effect of a continual exposure
  to a novel intervention, which we term a long-term treatment, based on an experiment
  involving only short-term observations. Key examples include the long-term health
  effects of regularly-taken medicine or of environmental hazards and the long-term
  effects on users of changes to an online platform. This stands in contrast to short-term
  treatments or "shocks," whose long-term effect can reasonably be mediated by short-term
  observations, enabling the use of surrogate methods. Long-term treatments by definition
  have direct effects on long-term outcomes via continual exposure, so surrogacy conditions
  cannot reasonably hold. We connect the problem with offline reinforcement learning,
  leveraging doubly-robust estimators to estimate long-term causal effects for long-term
  treatments and construct confidence intervals.
