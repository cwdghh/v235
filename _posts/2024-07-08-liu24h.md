title: Graph Adversarial Diffusion Convolution
openreview: ICvWruTEDH
abstract: This paper introduces a min-max optimization formulation for the Graph Signal
  Denoising (GSD) problem. In this formulation, we first maximize the second term
  of GSD by introducing perturbations to the graph structure based on Laplacian distance
  and then minimize the overall loss of the GSD. By solving the min-max optimization
  problem, we derive a new variant of the Graph Diffusion Convolution (GDC) architecture,
  called Graph Adversarial Diffusion Convolution (GADC). GADC differs from GDC by
  incorporating an additional term that enhances robustness against adversarial attacks
  on the graph structure and noise in node features. Moreover, GADC improves the performance
  of GDC on heterophilic graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
  of GADC across various datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/SongtaoLiu0823/GADC.
