title: 'SLEB: Streamlining LLMs through Redundancy Verification and Elimination of
  Transformer Blocks'
openreview: fuX4hyLPmO
abstract: 'Large language models (LLMs) have proven to be highly effective across
  various natural language processing tasks. However, their large number of parameters
  poses significant challenges for practical deployment. Pruning, a technique aimed
  at reducing the size and complexity of LLMs, offers a potential solution by removing
  redundant components from the network. Despite the promise of pruning, existing
  methods often struggle to achieve substantial end-to-end LLM inference speedup.
  In this paper, we introduce SLEB, a novel approach designed to stream- line LLMs
  by eliminating redundant transformer blocks. We choose the transformer block as
  the fundamental unit for pruning, because LLMs exhibit block-level redundancy with
  high similarity between the outputs of neighboring blocks. This choice allows us
  to effectively enhance the processing speed of LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate
  that SLEB outperforms previous LLM pruning methods in accelerating LLM inference
  while also maintaining superior perplexity and accuracy, making SLEB as a promising
  technique for enhancing the efficiency of LLMs. The code is available at: https://github.com/jiwonsong-dev/SLEB.'
