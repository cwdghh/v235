title: A Persuasive Approach to Combating Misinformation
openreview: UIxOkdBmxh
abstract: Bayesian Persuasion is proposed as a tool for social media platforms to
  combat the spread of misinformation. Since platforms can use machine learning to
  predict the popularity and misinformation features of to-be-shared posts, and users
  are largely motivated to share popular content, platforms can strategically signal
  this informational advantage to change user beliefs and persuade them not to share
  misinformation. We characterize the optimal signaling scheme with imperfect predictions
  as a linear program and give sufficient and necessary conditions on the classifier
  to ensure optimal platform utility is non-decreasing and continuous. Next, this
  interaction is considered under a performative model, wherein platform intervention
  affects the userâ€™s future behaviour. The convergence and stability of optimal signaling
  under this performative process are fully characterized. Lastly, we experimentally
  validate that our approach significantly reduces misinformation in both the single
  round and performative setting.
