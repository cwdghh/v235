title: Assessing the Brittleness of Safety Alignment via Pruning and Low-Rank Modifications
openreview: K6xxnKN2gm
abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show inherent brittleness in their safety mechanisms,
  as evidenced by their susceptibility to jailbreaking and even non-malicious fine-tuning.
  This study explores this brittleness of safety alignment by leveraging pruning and
  low-rank modifications. We develop methods to identify critical regions that are
  vital for safety guardrails, and that are disentangled from utility-relevant regions
  at both the neuron and rank levels. Surprisingly, the isolated regions we find are
  sparse, comprising about $3$ % at the parameter level and $2.5$ % at the rank level.
  Removing these regions compromises safety without significantly impacting utility,
  corroborating the inherent brittleness of the modelâ€™s safety mechanisms. Moreover,
  we show that LLMs remain vulnerable to low-cost fine-tuning attacks even when modifications
  to the safety-critical regions are restricted. These findings underscore the urgent
  need for more robust safety strategies in LLMs.
