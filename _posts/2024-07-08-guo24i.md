title: 'COLD-Attack: Jailbreaking LLMs with Stealthiness and Controllability'
openreview: yUxdk32TU6
abstract: Jailbreaks on large language models (LLMs) have recently received increasing
  attention. For a comprehensive assessment of LLM safety, it is essential to consider
  jailbreaks with diverse attributes, such as contextual coherence and sentiment/stylistic
  variations, and hence it is beneficial to study controllable jailbreaking, i.e.
  how to enforce control on LLM attacks. In this paper, we formally formulate the
  controllable attack generation problem, and build a novel connection between this
  problem and controllable text generation, a well-explored topic of natural language
  processing. Based on this connection, we adapt the Energy-based Constrained Decoding
  with Langevin Dynamics (COLD), a state-of-the-art, highly efficient algorithm in
  controllable text generation, and introduce the COLD-Attack framework which unifies
  and automates the search of adversarial LLM attacks under a variety of control requirements
  such as fluency, stealthiness, sentiment, and left-right-coherence. The controllability
  enabled by COLD-Attack leads to diverse new jailbreak scenarios which not only cover
  the standard setting of generating fluent (suffix) attack with continuation constraint,
  but also allow us to address new controllable attack settings such as revising a
  user query adversarially with paraphrasing constraint, and inserting stealthy attacks
  in context with position constraint. Our extensive experiments on various LLMs (Llama-2,
  Mistral, Vicuna, Guanaco, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4) show COLD-Attackâ€™s broad applicability,
  strong controllability, high success rate, and attack transferability. Our code
  is available at https://github.com/Yu-Fangxu/COLD-Attack.
