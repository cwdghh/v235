title: 'Split-Ensemble: Efficient OOD-aware Ensemble via Task and Model Splitting'
openreview: pQyoBWA146
abstract: Uncertainty estimation is crucial for deep learning models to detect out-of-distribution
  (OOD) inputs. However, the naive deep learning classifiers produce uncalibrated
  uncertainty for OOD data. Improving the uncertainty estimation typically requires
  external data for OOD-aware training or considerable costs to build an ensemble.
  In this work, we improve on uncertainty estimation without extra OOD data or additional
  inference costs using an alternative <em>Split-Ensemble</em> method. Specifically,
  we propose a novel <em>subtask-splitting</em> ensemble training objective where
  a task is split into several complementary subtasks based on feature similarity.
  Each subtask considers part of the data as in distribution while all the rest as
  OOD data. Diverse submodels can therefore be trained on each subtask with OOD-aware
  objectives, learning generalizable uncertainty estimation. To avoid overheads, we
  enable low-level feature sharing among submodels, building a tree-like Split-Ensemble
  architecture via iterative splitting and pruning. Empirical study shows Split-Ensemble,
  without additional computational cost, improves accuracy over a single model by
  0.8%, 1.8%, and 25.5% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet, respectively. OOD
  detection for the same backbone and in-distribution datasets surpasses a single
  model baseline by 2.2%, 8.1%, and 29.6% in mean AUROC, respectively.
