title: Reflected Flow Matching
openreview: Sf5KYznS2G
abstract: Continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) learn an ordinary differential equation
  to transform prior samples into data. Flow matching (FM) has recently emerged as
  a simulation-free approach for training CNFs by regressing a velocity model towards
  the conditional velocity field. However, on constrained domains, the learned velocity
  model may lead to undesirable flows that result in highly unnatural samples, e.g.,
  oversaturated images, due to both flow matching error and simulation error. To address
  this, we add a boundary constraint term to CNFs, which leads to reflected CNFs that
  keep trajectories within the constrained domains. We propose reflected flow matching
  (RFM) to train the velocity model in reflected CNFs by matching the conditional
  velocity fields in a simulation-free manner, similar to the vanilla FM. Moreover,
  the analytical form of conditional velocity fields in RFM avoids potentially biased
  approximations, making it superior to existing score-based generative models on
  constrained domains. We demonstrate that RFM achieves comparable or better results
  on standard image benchmarks and produces high-quality class-conditioned samples
  under high guidance weight.
