title: 'Beyond Regular Grids: Fourier-Based Neural Operators on Arbitrary Domains'
openreview: aVqqoFAavs
abstract: The computational efficiency of many neural operators, widely used for learning
  solutions of PDEs, relies on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) for performing spectral
  computations. As the FFT is limited to equispaced (rectangular) grids, this limits
  the efficiency of such neural operators when applied to problems where the input
  and output functions need to be processed on general non-equispaced point distributions.
  Leveraging the observation that a limited set of Fourier (Spectral) modes suffice
  to provide the required expressivity of a neural operator, we propose a simple method,
  based on the efficient direct evaluation of the underlying spectral transformation,
  to extend neural operators to arbitrary domains. An efficient implementation of
  such <em>direct spectral evaluations</em> is coupled with existing neural operator
  models to allow the processing of data on arbitrary non-equispaced distributions
  of points. With extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed
  method allows us to extend neural operators to arbitrary point distributions with
  significant gains in training speed over baselines, while retaining or improving
  the accuracy of Fourier neural operators (FNOs) and related neural operators.
