title: 'RoboGen: Towards Unleashing Infinite Data for Automated Robot Learning via
  Generative Simulation'
openreview: SQIDlJd3hN
abstract: 'We present RoboGen, a generative robotic agent that automatically learns
  diverse robotic skills at scale via generative simulation. RoboGen leverages the
  latest advancements in foundation and generative models. Instead of directly adapting
  these models to produce policies or low-level actions, we advocate for a generative
  scheme, which uses these models to automatically generate diversified tasks, scenes,
  and training supervisions, thereby scaling up robotic skill learning with minimal
  human supervision. Our approach equips a robotic agent with a self-guided propose-generate-learn
  cycle: the agent first proposes interesting tasks and skills to develop, and then
  generates simulation environments by populating pertinent assets with proper spatial
  configurations. Afterwards, the agent decomposes the proposed task into sub-tasks,
  selects the optimal learning approach (reinforcement learning, motion planning,
  or trajectory optimization), generates required training supervision, and then learns
  policies to acquire the proposed skill. Our fully generative pipeline can be queried
  repeatedly, producing an endless stream of skill demonstrations associated with
  diverse tasks and environments.'
