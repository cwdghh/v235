title: Predicting Lagrangian Multipliers for Mixed Integer Linear Programs
openreview: aZnZOqUOHq
abstract: 'Lagrangian Relaxation stands among the most efficient approaches for solving
  Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) with difficult constraints. Given any duals
  for these constraints, called Lagrangian Multipliers (LMs), it returns a bound on
  the optimal value of the MILP, and Lagrangian methods seek the LMs giving the best
  such bound. But these methods generally rely on iterative algorithms resembling
  gradient descent to maximize the concave piecewise linear dual function: the computational
  burden grows quickly with the number of relaxed constraints. We introduce a deep
  learning approach that bypasses the descent, effectively amortizing per instance
  optimization. A probabilistic encoder based on a graph neural network computes,
  given a MILP instance and its Continuous Relaxation (CR) solution, high-dimensional
  representations of relaxed constraints, which are turned into LMs by a decoder.
  We train the encoder and the decoder jointly by directly optimizing the bound obtained
  from the predicted multipliers. Our method is applicable to any problem with a compact
  MILP formulation, and to any Lagrangian Relaxation providing a tighter bound than
  CR. Experiments on two widely known problems, Multi-Commodity Network Design and
  Generalized Assignment, show that our approach closes up to 85% of the gap between
  the continuous relaxation and the best Lagrangian bound, and provides a high-quality
  warm-start for descent-based Lagrangian methods.'
