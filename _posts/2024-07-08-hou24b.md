title: Decomposing Uncertainty for Large Language Models through Input Clarification
  Ensembling
openreview: byxXa99PtF
abstract: Uncertainty decomposition refers to the task of decomposing the total uncertainty
  of a predictive model into aleatoric (data) uncertainty, resulting from inherent
  randomness in the data-generating process, and epistemic (model) uncertainty, resulting
  from missing information in the model’s training data. In large language models
  (LLMs) specifically, identifying sources of uncertainty is an important step toward
  improving reliability, trustworthiness, and interpretability, but remains an important
  open research question. In this paper, we introduce an uncertainty decomposition
  framework for LLMs, called input clarification ensembling, which can be applied
  to any pre-trained LLM. Our approach generates a set of clarifications for the input,
  feeds them into an LLM, and ensembles the corresponding predictions. We show that,
  when aleatoric uncertainty arises from ambiguity or under-specification in LLM inputs,
  this approach makes it possible to factor an (un-clarified) LLM’s predictions into
  separate aleatoric and epistemic terms, using a decomposition similar to the one
  employed by Bayesian neural networks. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that input
  clarification ensembling provides accurate and reliable uncertainty quantification
  on several language processing tasks. Code and data are available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/llm_uncertainty.
