title: Differentiable Mapper for Topological Optimization of Data Representation
openreview: QZ1DVzr6N9
abstract: 'Unsupervised data representation and visualization using tools from topology
  is an active and growing field of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and data science.
  Its most prominent line of work is based on the so-called Mapper graph, which is
  a combinatorial graph whose topological structures (connected components, branches,
  loops) are in correspondence with those of the data itself. While highly generic
  and applicable, its use has been hampered so far by the manual tuning of its many
  parameters—among these, a crucial one is the so-called filter: it is a continuous
  function whose variations on the data set are the main ingredient for both building
  the Mapper representation and assessing the presence and sizes of its topological
  structures. However, while a few parameter tuning methods have already been investigated
  for the other Mapper parameters (i.e., resolution, gain, clustering), there is currently
  no method for tuning the filter itself. In this work, we build on a recently proposed
  optimization framework incorporating topology to provide the first filter optimization
  scheme for Mapper graphs. In order to achieve this, we propose a relaxed and more
  general version of the Mapper graph, whose convergence properties are investigated.
  Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by optimizing Mapper graph
  representations on several datasets, and showcasing the superiority of the optimized
  representation over arbitrary ones.'
