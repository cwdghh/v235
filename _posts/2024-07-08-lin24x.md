title: Graph Neural Stochastic Diffusion for Estimating Uncertainty in Node Classification
openreview: xJUhgvM2u8
abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced the state of the art in various
  domains. Despite their remarkable success, the uncertainty estimation of GNN predictions
  remains under-explored, which limits their practical applications especially in
  risk-sensitive areas. Current works suffer from either intractable posteriors or
  inflexible prior specifications, leading to sub-optimal empirical results. In this
  paper, we present graph neural stochastic diffusion (GNSD), a novel framework for
  estimating predictive uncertainty on graphs by establishing theoretical connections
  between GNNs and stochastic partial differential equation. GNSD represents a GNN-based
  parameterization of the proposed graph stochastic diffusion equation which includes
  a $Q$-Wiener process to model the stochastic evolution of node representations.
  GNSD introduces a drift network to guarantee accurate prediction and a stochastic
  forcing network to model the propagation of epistemic uncertainty among nodes. Extensive
  experiments are conducted on multiple detection tasks, demonstrating that GNSD yields
  the superior performance over existing strong approaches.
