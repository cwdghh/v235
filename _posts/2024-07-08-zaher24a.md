title: 'Manifold Integrated Gradients: Riemannian Geometry for Feature Attribution'
openreview: qoOt02l2WC
abstract: 'In this paper, we dive into the reliability concerns of Integrated Gradients
  (IG), a prevalent feature attribution method for black-box deep learning models.
  We particularly address two predominant challenges associated with IG: the generation
  of noisy feature visualizations for vision models and the vulnerability to adversarial
  attributional attacks. Our approach involves an adaptation of path-based feature
  attribution, aligning the path of attribution more closely to the intrinsic geometry
  of the data manifold. Our experiments utilise deep generative models applied to
  several real-world image datasets. They demonstrate that IG along the geodesics
  conforms to the curved geometry of the Riemannian data manifold, generating more
  perceptually intuitive explanations and, subsequently, substantially increasing
  robustness to targeted attributional attacks.'
