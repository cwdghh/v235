title: Online bipartite matching with imperfect advice
openreview: 61WtHsVKWF
abstract: We study the problem of online unweighted bipartite matching with $n$ offline
  vertices and $n$ online vertices where one wishes to be competitive against the
  optimal offline algorithm. While the classic RANKING algorithm of (Karp et al.,
  1990) provably attains competitive ratio of $1-1/e > 1/2$, we show that no learning-augmented
  method can be both 1-consistent and strictly better than 1/2-robust under the adversarial
  arrival model. Meanwhile, under the random arrival model, we show how one can utilize
  methods from distribution testing to design an algorithm that takes in external
  advice about the online vertices and provably achieves competitive ratio interpolating
  between any ratio attainable by advice-free methods and the optimal ratio of 1,
  depending on the advice quality.
