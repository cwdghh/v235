title: Deep Regression Representation Learning with Topology
openreview: HbdeEGVfEN
abstract: 'Most works studying representation learning focus only on classification
  and neglect regression. Yet, the learning objectives and, therefore, the representation
  topologies of the two tasks are fundamentally different: classification targets
  class separation, leading to disconnected representations, whereas regression requires
  ordinality with respect to the target, leading to continuous representations. We
  thus wonder how the effectiveness of a regression representation is influenced by
  its topology, with evaluation based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle.
  The IB principle is an important framework that provides principles for learning
  effective representations. We establish two connections between it and the topology
  of regression representations. The first connection reveals that a lower intrinsic
  dimension of the feature space implies a reduced complexity of the representation
  $Z$. This complexity can be quantified as the conditional entropy of $Z$ on the
  target $Y$, and serves as an upper bound on the generalization error. The second
  connection suggests a feature space that is topologically similar to the target
  space will better align with the IB principle. Based on these two connections, we
  introduce PH-Reg, a regularizer specific to regression that matches the intrinsic
  dimension and topology of the feature space with the target space. Experiments on
  synthetic and real-world regression tasks demonstrate the benefits of PH-Reg. Code:
