title: Cross-Domain Policy Adaptation by Capturing Representation Mismatch
openreview: 3uPSQmjXzd
abstract: It is vital to learn effective policies that can be transferred to different
  domains with dynamics discrepancies in reinforcement learning (RL). In this paper,
  we consider dynamics adaptation settings where there exists dynamics mismatch between
  the source domain and the target domain, and one can get access to sufficient source
  domain data, while can only have limited interactions with the target domain. Existing
  methods address this problem by learning domain classifiers, performing data filtering
  from a value discrepancy perspective, etc. Instead, we tackle this challenge from
  a decoupled representation learning perspective. We perform representation learning
  only in the target domain and measure the representation deviations on the transitions
  from the source domain, which we show can be a signal of dynamics mismatch. We also
  show that representation deviation upper bounds performance difference of a given
  policy in the source domain and target domain, which motivates us to adopt representation
  deviation as a reward penalty. The produced representations are not involved in
  either policy or value function, but only serve as a reward penalizer. We conduct
  extensive experiments on environments with kinematic and morphology mismatch, and
  the results show that our method exhibits strong performance on many tasks. Our
  code is publicly available at https://github.com/dmksjfl/PAR.
