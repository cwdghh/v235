title: On the Calibration of Human Pose Estimation
openreview: 0THUA66D8Z
abstract: 2D human pose estimation predicts keypoint locations and the corresponding
  confidence. Calibration-wise, the confidence should be aligned with the pose accuracy.
  Yet existing pose estimation methods tend to estimate confidence with heuristics
  such as the maximum value of heatmaps. This work shows, through theoretical analysis
  and empirical verification, a calibration gap in current pose estimation frameworks.
  Our derivations directly lead to closed-form adjustments in the confidence based
  on additionally inferred instance size and visibility. Given the black-box nature
  of deep neural networks, however, it is not possible to close the gap with only
  closed-form adjustments. We go one step further and propose a Calibrated ConfidenceNet
  (CCNet) to explicitly learn network-specific adjustments with a confidence prediction
  branch. The proposed CCNet, as a lightweight post-hoc addition, improves the calibration
  of standard off-the-shelf pose estimation frameworks.
