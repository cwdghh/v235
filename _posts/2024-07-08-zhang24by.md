title: Generalization Analysis for Multi-Label Learning
openreview: W4mLp5KuKl
abstract: Despite great advances in algorithms for multi-label learning, research
  on the theoretical analysis of generalization is still in the early stage. Some
  recent theoretical results has investigated the generalization performance of multi-label
  learning under several evaluation metrics, however, how to reduce the dependency
  on the number of labels, explicitly introduce label correlations, and quantitatively
  analyze the impact of various inductive biases in the generalization analysis of
  multi-label learning is still a crucial and open problem. In an attempt to make
  up for the gap in the generalization theory of multi-label learning, we develop
  several novel vector-contraction inequalities, which exploit the Lipschitz continuity
  of loss functions, and derive generalization bounds with a weaker dependency on
  the number of labels than the state of the art in the case of decoupling the relationship
  among different components, which serves as theoretical guarantees for the generalization
  of multi-label learning. In addition, we derive the generalization bound for Macro-Averaged
  AUC and analyze its relationship with class-imbalance. The mild bounds without strong
  assumptions explain the good generalization ability of multi-label learning with
  first-order label correlations and high-order label correlations induced by norm
  regularizers.
