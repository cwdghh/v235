title: Factored-Reward Bandits with Intermediate Observations
openreview: C7Z8EhZ6bl
abstract: In several real-world sequential decision problems, at every step, the learner
  is required to select different actions. Every action affects a specific part of
  the system and generates an observable intermediate effect. In this paper, we introduce
  the Factored-Reward Bandits (FRBs), a novel setting able to effectively capture
  and exploit the structure of this class of scenarios, where the reward is computed
  as the product of the action intermediate observations. We characterize the statistical
  complexity of the learning problem in the FRBs, by deriving worst-case and asymptotic
  instance-dependent regret lower bounds. Then, we devise and analyze two regret minimization
  algorithms. The former, F-UCB, is an anytime optimistic approach matching the worst-case
  lower bound (up to logarithmic factors) but fails to perform optimally from the
  instance-dependent perspective. The latter, F-Track, is a bound-tracking approach,
  that enjoys optimal asymptotic instance-dependent regret guarantees.
