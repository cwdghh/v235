title: 'Offline-Boosted Actor-Critic: Adaptively Blending Optimal Historical Behaviors
  in Deep Off-Policy RL'
openreview: 7joG3i2pUR
abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved notable success in tackling
  many complex real-world tasks, by leveraging previously collected data for policy
  learning. However, most existing off-policy RL algorithms fail to maximally exploit
  the information in the replay buffer, limiting sample efficiency and policy performance.
  In this work, we discover that concurrently training an offline RL policy based
  on the shared online replay buffer can sometimes outperform the original online
  learning policy, though the occurrence of such performance gains remains uncertain.
  This motivates a new possibility of harnessing the emergent outperforming offline
  optimal policy to improve online policy learning. Based on this insight, we present
  Offline-Boosted Actor-Critic (OBAC), a model-free online RL framework that elegantly
  identifies the outperforming offline policy through value comparison, and uses it
  as an adaptive constraint to guarantee stronger policy learning performance. Our
  experiments demonstrate that OBAC outperforms other popular model-free RL baselines
  and rivals advanced model-based RL methods in terms of sample efficiency and asymptotic
  performance across <b>53</b> tasks spanning <b>6</b> task suites.
