title: 'More Benefits of Being Distributional: Second-Order Bounds for Reinforcement
  Learning'
openreview: kZBCFQe1Ej
abstract: In this paper, we prove that Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DistRL),
  which learns the return distribution, can obtain second-order bounds in both online
  and offline RL in general settings with function approximation. Second-order bounds
  are instance-dependent bounds that scale with the variance of return, which we prove
  are tighter than the previously known small-loss bounds of distributional RL. To
  the best of our knowledge, our results are the first second-order bounds for low-rank
  MDPs and for offline RL. When specializing to contextual bandits (one-step RL problem),
  we show that a distributional learning based optimism algorithm achieves a second-order
  worst-case regret bound, and a second-order gap dependent bound, simultaneously.
  We also empirically demonstrate the benefit of DistRL in contextual bandits on real-world
  datasets. We highlight that our analysis with DistRL is relatively simple, follows
  the general framework of optimism in the face of uncertainty and does not require
  weighted regression. Our results suggest that DistRL is a promising framework for
  obtaining second-order bounds in general RL settings, thus further reinforcing the
  benefits of DistRL.
