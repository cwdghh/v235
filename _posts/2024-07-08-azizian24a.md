title: What is the Long-Run Distribution of Stochastic Gradient Descent? A Large Deviations
  Analysis
openreview: vsOF7qDNhl
abstract: In this paper, we examine the long-run distribution of stochastic gradient
  descent (SGD) in general, non-convex problems. Specifically, we seek to understand
  which regions of the problem’s state space are more likely to be visited by SGD,
  and by how much. Using an approach based on the theory of large deviations and randomly
  perturbed dynamical systems, we show that the long-run distribution of SGD resembles
  the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution of equilibrium thermodynamics with temperature
  equal to the method’s step-size and energy levels determined by the problem’s objective
  and the statistics of the noise. In particular, we show that, in the long run, (<em>a</em>)
  the problem’s critical region is visited exponentially more often than any non-critical
  region; (<em>b</em>) the iterates of SGD are exponentially concentrated around the
  problem’s minimum energy state (which does not always coincide with the global minimum
  of the objective); (<em>c</em>) all other connected components of critical points
  are visited with frequency that is exponentially proportional to their energy level;
  and, finally, (<em>d</em>) any component of local maximizers or saddle points is
  "dominated" by a component of local minimizers which is visited exponentially more
  often.
