title: 'In-Context Unlearning: Language Models as Few-Shot Unlearners'
openreview: GKcwle8XC9
abstract: Machine unlearning, the study of efficiently removing the impact of specific
  training instances on a model, has garnered increased attention in recent years
  due to regulatory guidelines such as the Right to be Forgotten. Achieving precise
  unlearning typically involves fully retraining the model and is computationally
  infeasible in case of very large models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). To
  this end, recent work has proposed several algorithms which approximate the removal
  of training data without retraining the model. These algorithms crucially rely on
  access to the model parameters in order to update them, an assumption that may not
  hold in practice due to computational constraints or having only query access to
  the LLMs. In this work, we propose a new class of unlearning methods for LLMs called
  “In-Context Unlearning.” This method unlearns instances from the model by simply
  providing specific kinds of inputs in context, without the need to update model
  parameters. To unlearn specific training instances, we present these instances to
  the LLMs at inference time along with labels that differ from their ground truth.
  Our experimental results demonstrate that in-context unlearning performs on par
  with, or in some cases outperforms other state-of-the-art methods that require access
  to model parameters, effectively removing the influence of specific instances on
  the model while preserving test accuracy.
