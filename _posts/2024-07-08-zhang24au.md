title: 'Sequential Asynchronous Action Coordination in Multi-Agent Systems: A Stackelberg
  Decision Transformer Approach'
openreview: M3qRRkOuTN
abstract: Asynchronous action coordination presents a pervasive challenge in Multi-Agent
  Systems (MAS), which can be represented as a Stackelberg game (SG). However, the
  scalability of existing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods based
  on SG is severely restricted by network architectures or environmental settings.
  To address this issue, we propose the Stackelberg Decision Transformer (STEER).
  It efficiently manages decision-making processes by incorporating the hierarchical
  decision structure of SG, the modeling capability of autoregressive sequence models,
  and the exploratory learning methodology of MARL. Our approach exhibits broad applicability
  across diverse task types and environmental configurations in MAS. Experimental
  results demonstrate both the convergence of our method towards Stackelberg equilibrium
  strategies and its superiority over strong baselines in complex scenarios.
