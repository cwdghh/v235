title: 'Adaptive-Gradient Policy Optimization: Enhancing Policy Learning in Non-Smooth
  Differentiable Simulations'
openreview: S9DV6ZP4eE
abstract: Recent advancements in differentiable simulators highlight the potential
  of policy optimization using simulation gradients. Yet, these approaches are largely
  contingent on the continuity and smoothness of the simulation, which precludes the
  use of certain simulation engines, such as Mujoco. To tackle this challenge, we
  introduce the adaptive analytic gradient. This method views the Q function as a
  surrogate for future returns, consistent with the Bellman equation. By analyzing
  the variance of batched gradients, our method can autonomously opt for a more resilient
  Q function to compute the gradient when encountering rough simulation transitions.
  We also put forth the Adaptive-Gradient Policy Optimization (AGPO) algorithm, which
  leverages our proposed method for policy learning. On the theoretical side, we demonstrate
  AGPOâ€™s convergence, emphasizing its stable performance under non-smooth dynamics
  due to low variance. On the empirical side, our results show that AGPO effectively
  mitigates the challenges posed by non-smoothness in policy learning through differentiable
  simulation.
