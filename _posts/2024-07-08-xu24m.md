title: Conformal prediction for multi-dimensional time series by ellipsoidal sets
openreview: uN39Tt9P8b
abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) has been a popular method for uncertainty quantification
  because it is distribution-free, model-agnostic, and theoretically sound. For forecasting
  problems in supervised learning, most CP methods focus on building prediction intervals
  for univariate responses. In this work, we develop a sequential CP method called
  $\texttt{MultiDimSPCI}$ that builds prediction $\textit{regions}$ for a multivariate
  response, especially in the context of multivariate time series, which are not exchangeable.
  Theoretically, we estimate $\textit{finite-sample}$ high-probability bounds on the
  conditional coverage gap. Empirically, we demonstrate that $\texttt{MultiDimSPCI}$
  maintains valid coverage on a wide range of multivariate time series while producing
  smaller prediction regions than CP and non-CP baselines.
