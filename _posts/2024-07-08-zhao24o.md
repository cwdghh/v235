title: 'Two Fists, One Heart: Multi-Objective Optimization Based Strategy Fusion for
  Long-tailed Learning'
openreview: MEZydkOr3l
abstract: Real-world data generally follows a long-tailed distribution, which makes
  traditional high-performance training strategies unable to show their usual effects.
  Various insights have been proposed to alleviate this challenging distribution.
  However, some observations indicate that models trained on long-tailed distributions
  always show a trade-off between the performance of head and tail classes. For a
  profound understanding of the trade-off, we first theoretically analyze the trade-off
  problem in long-tailed learning and creatively transform the trade-off problem in
  long-tailed learning into a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. Motivated
  by these analyses, we propose the idea of strategy fusion for MOO long-tailed learning
  and point out the potential conflict problem. We further design a Multi-Objective
  Optimization based Strategy Fusion (MOOSF), which effectively resolves conflicts,
  and achieves an efficient fusion of heterogeneous strategies. Comprehensive experiments
  on mainstream datasets show that even the simplest strategy fusion can outperform
  complex long-tailed strategies. More importantly, it provides a new perspective
  for generalized long-tailed learning. The code is available in the accompanying
  supplementary materials.
