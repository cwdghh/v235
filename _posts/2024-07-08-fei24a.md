title: 'Video-of-Thought: Step-by-Step Video Reasoning from Perception to Cognition'
openreview: fO31YAyNbI
abstract: 'Existing research of video understanding still struggles to achieve in-depth
  comprehension and reasoning in complex videos, primarily due to the under-exploration
  of two key bottlenecks: fine-grained spatial-temporal perceptive understanding and
  cognitive-level video scene comprehension. This paper bridges the gap by presenting
  a novel solution. We first introduce a novel video Multimodal Large Language Model
  (MLLM), MotionEpic, which achieves fine-grained pixel-level spatial-temporal video
  grounding by integrating video spatial-temporal scene graph (STSG) representation.
  Building upon MotionEpic, we then develop a Video-of-Thought (VoT) reasoning framework.
  VoT inherits the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) core, breaking down a complex task into
  simpler and manageable sub-problems, and addressing them step-by-step from a low-level
  pixel perception to high-level cognitive interpretation. Extensive experiments across
  various complex video QA benchmarks demonstrate that our overall framework strikingly
  boosts existing state-of-the-art. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at
  successfully implementing the CoT technique for achieving human-level video reasoning,
  where we show great potential in extending it to a wider range of video understanding
  scenarios. Systems and codes will be open later.'
