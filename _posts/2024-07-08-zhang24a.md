title: Tight Partial Identification of Causal Effects with Marginal Distribution of
  Unmeasured Confounders
openreview: jEWpcEyuUl
abstract: Partial identification (PI) presents a significant challenge in causal inference
  due to the incomplete measurement of confounders. Given that obtaining auxiliary
  variables of confounders is not always feasible and relies on untestable assumptions,
  researchers are encouraged to explore the internal information of latent confounders
  without external assistance. However, these prevailing PI results often lack precise
  mathematical measurement from observational data or assume that the information
  pertaining to confounders falls within extreme scenarios. In our paper, we reassess
  the significance of the marginal confounder distribution in PI. We refrain from
  imposing additional restrictions on the marginal confounder distribution, such as
  entropy or mutual information. Instead, we establish the closed-form tight PI for
  any possible P(U) in the discrete case. Furthermore, we establish the if and only
  if criterion for discerning whether the marginal confounder information leads to
  non-vanilla PI regions. This reveals a fundamental negative result wherein the marginal
  confounder information minimally contributes to PI as the confounderâ€™s cardinality
  increases. Our theoretical findings are supported by experiments.
