title: Improving Token-Based World Models with Parallel Observation Prediction
openreview: Lfp5Dk1xb6
abstract: Motivated by the success of Transformers when applied to sequences of discrete
  symbols, token-based world models (TBWMs) were recently proposed as sample-efficient
  methods. In TBWMs, the world model consumes agent experience as a language-like
  sequence of tokens, where each observation constitutes a sub-sequence. However,
  during imagination, the sequential token-by-token generation of next observations
  results in a severe bottleneck, leading to long training times, poor GPU utilization,
  and limited representations. To resolve this bottleneck, we devise a novel Parallel
  Observation Prediction (POP) mechanism. POP augments a Retentive Network (RetNet)
  with a novel forward mode tailored to our reinforcement learning setting. We incorporate
  POP in a novel TBWM agent named REM (Retentive Environment Model), showcasing a
  15.4x faster imagination compared to prior TBWMs. REM attains superhuman performance
  on 12 out of 26 games of the Atari 100K benchmark, while training in less than 12
  hours. Our code is available at https://github.com/leor-c/REM
