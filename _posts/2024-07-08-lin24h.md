title: 'Robustness of Deep Learning for Accelerated MRI: Benefits of Diverse Training
  Data'
openreview: nvfZgdHtHc
abstract: Deep learning based methods for image reconstruction are state-of-the-art
  for a variety of imaging tasks. However, neural networks often perform worse if
  the training data differs significantly from the data they are applied to. For example,
  a model trained for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on one scanner
  performs worse on another scanner. In this work, we investigate the impact of the
  training data on a modelâ€™s performance and robustness for accelerated MRI. We find
  that models trained on the combination of various data distributions, such as those
  obtained from different MRI scanners and anatomies, exhibit robustness equal or
  superior to models trained on the best single distribution for a specific target
  distribution. Thus training on such diverse data tends to improve robustness. Furthermore,
  training on such a diverse dataset does not compromise in-distribution performance,
  i.e., a model trained on diverse data yields in-distribution performance at least
  as good as models trained on the more narrow individual distributions. Our results
  suggest that training a model for imaging on a variety of distributions tends to
  yield a more effective and robust model than maintaining separate models for individual
  distributions.
