title: Prompt-based Visual Alignment for Zero-shot Policy Transfer
openreview: PPoQz8K4GZ
abstract: Overfitting in RL has become one of the main obstacles to applications in
  reinforcement learning(RL). Existing methods do not provide explicit semantic constrain
  for the feature extractor, hindering the agent from learning a unified cross-domain
  representation and resulting in performance degradation on unseen domains. Besides,
  abundant data from multiple domains are needed. To address these issues, in this
  work, we propose prompt-based visual alignment (PVA), a robust framework to mitigate
  the detrimental domain bias in the image for zero-shot policy transfer. Inspired
  that Visual-Language Model (VLM) can serve as a bridge to connect both text space
  and image space, we leverage the semantic information contained in a text sequence
  as an explicit constraint to train a visual aligner. Thus, the visual aligner can
  map images from multiple domains to a unified domain and achieve good generalization
  performance. To better depict semantic information, prompt tuning is applied to
  learn a sequence of learnable tokens. With explicit constraints of semantic information,
  PVA can learn unified cross-domain representation under limited access to cross-domain
  data and achieves great zero-shot generalization ability in unseen domains. We verify
  PVA on a vision-based autonomous driving task with CARLA simulator. Experiments
  show that the agent generalizes well on unseen domains under limited access to multi-domain
  data.
