title: Generalization Bound and New Algorithm for Clean-Label Backdoor Attack
openreview: ZdqiT0McON
abstract: The generalization bound is a crucial theoretical tool for assessing the
  generalizability of learning methods and there exist vast literatures on generalizability
  of normal learning, adversarial learning, and data poisoning. Unlike other data
  poison attacks, the backdoor attack has the special property that the poisoned triggers
  are contained in both the training set and the test set and the purpose of the attack
  is two-fold. To our knowledge, the generalization bound for the backdoor attack
  has not been established. In this paper, we fill this gap by deriving algorithm-independent
  generalization bounds in the clean-label backdoor attack scenario. Precisely, based
  on the goals of backdoor attack, we give upper bounds for the clean sample population
  errors and the poison population errors in terms of the empirical error on the poisoned
  training dataset. Furthermore, based on the theoretical result, a new clean-label
  backdoor attack is proposed that computes the poisoning trigger by combining adversarial
  noise and indiscriminate poison. We show its effectiveness in a variety of settings.
