title: 'Genie: Generative Interactive Environments'
openreview: bJbSbJskOS
abstract: We introduce Genie, the first <em>generative interactive environment</em>
  trained in an unsupervised manner from unlabelled Internet videos. The model can
  be prompted to generate an endless variety of action-controllable virtual worlds
  described through text, synthetic images, photographs, and even sketches. At 11B
  parameters, Genie can be considered a <em>foundation world model</em>. It is comprised
  of a spatiotemporal video tokenizer, an autoregressive dynamics model, and a simple
  and scalable latent action model. Genie enables users to act in the generated environments
  on a frame-by-frame basis <em>despite training without any ground-truth action labels</em>
  or other domain specific requirements typically found in the world model literature.
  Further the resulting learned latent action space facilitates training agents to
  imitate behaviors from unseen videos, opening the path for training generalist agents
  of the future.
