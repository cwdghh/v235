title: 'Representation Surgery: Theory and Practice of Affine Steering'
openreview: GwA4go0Mw4
abstract: Language models often exhibit undesirable behavior, e.g., generating toxic
  or gender-biased text. In the case of neural language models, an encoding of the
  undesirable behavior is often present in the model’s representations. Thus, one
  natural (and common) approach to prevent the model from exhibiting undesirable behavior
  is to steer the model’s representations in a manner that reduces the probability
  of it generating undesirable text. This paper investigates the formal and empirical
  properties of steering functions, i.e., transformation of the neural language model’s
  representations that alter its behavior. First, we derive two optimal, in the least-squares
  sense, affine steering functions under different constraints. Our theory provides
  justification for existing approaches and offers a novel, improved steering approach.
  Second, we offer a series of experiments that demonstrate the empirical effectiveness
  of the methods in mitigating bias and reducing toxic generation.
