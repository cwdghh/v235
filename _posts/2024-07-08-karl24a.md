title: 'Position: Embracing Negative Results in Machine Learning'
openreview: 3RXAiU7sss
abstract: Publications proposing novel machine learning methods are often primarily
  rated by exhibited predictive performance on selected problems. In this position
  paper we argue that predictive performance alone is not a good indicator for the
  worth of a publication. Using it as such even fosters problems like inefficiencies
  of the machine learning research community as a whole and setting wrong incentives
  for researchers. We therefore put out a call for the publication of “negative” results,
  which can help alleviate some of these problems and improve the scientific output
  of the machine learning research community. To substantiate our position, we present
  the advantages of publishing negative results and provide concrete measures for
  the community to move towards a paradigm where their publication is normalized.
