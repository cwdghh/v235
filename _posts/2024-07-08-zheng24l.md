title: 'ContPhy: Continuum Physical Concept Learning and Reasoning from Videos'
openreview: tVwzR1myUp
abstract: We introduce the Continuum Physical Dataset (ContPhy), a novel benchmark
  for assessing machine physical commonsense. ContPhy complements existing physical
  reasoning benchmarks by encompassing the inference of diverse physical properties,
  such as mass and density, across various scenarios and predicting corresponding
  dynamics. We evaluated a range of AI models and found that they still struggle to
  achieve satisfactory performance on ContPhy, which shows that current AI models
  still lack physical commonsense for the continuum, especially soft-bodies, and illustrates
  the value of the proposed dataset. We also introduce an oracle model (ContPRO) that
  marries the particle-based physical dynamic models with the recent large language
  models, which enjoy the advantages of both models, precise dynamic predictions,
  and interpretable reasoning. ContPhy aims to spur progress in perception and reasoning
  within diverse physical settings, narrowing the divide between human and machine
  intelligence in understanding the physical world.
