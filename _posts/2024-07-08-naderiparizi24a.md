title: Don’t be so Negative! Score-based Generative Modeling with Oracle-assisted
  Guidance
openreview: H8pMSJwRD5
abstract: Score-based diffusion models are a powerful class of generative models,
  widely utilized across diverse domains. Despite significant advancements in large-scale
  tasks such as text-to-image generation, their application to constrained domains
  has received considerably less attention. This work addresses model learning in
  a setting where, in addition to the training dataset, there further exists side-information
  in the form of an oracle that can label samples as being outside the support of
  the true data generating distribution. Specifically we develop a new denoising diffusion
  probabilistic modeling methodology, Gen-neG, that leverages this additional side-information.
  Gen-neG builds on classifier guidance in diffusion models to guide the generation
  process towards the positive support region indicated by the oracle. We empirically
  establish the utility of Gen-neG in applications including collision avoidance in
  self-driving simulators and safety-guarded human motion generation.
