title: 'Feature Distribution on Graph Topology Mediates the Effect of Graph Convolution:
  Homophily Perspective'
openreview: buW1Bi6XFw
abstract: How would randomly shuffling feature vectors among nodes from the same class
  affect graph neural networks (GNNs)? The feature shuffle, intuitively, perturbs
  the dependence between graph topology and features (A-X dependence) for GNNs to
  learn from. Surprisingly, we observe a consistent and significant improvement in
  GNN performance following the feature shuffle. Having overlooked the impact of A-X
  dependence on GNNs, the prior literature does not provide a satisfactory understanding
  of the phenomenon. Thus, we raise two research questions. First, how should A-X
  dependence be measured, while controlling for potential confounds? Second, how does
  A-X dependence affect GNNs? In response, we (i) propose a principled measure for
  A-X dependence, (ii) design a random graph model that controls A-X dependence, (iii)
  establish a theory on how A-X dependence relates to graph convolution, and (iv)
  present empirical analysis on real-world graphs that align with the theory. We conclude
  that A-X dependence mediates the effect of graph convolution, such that smaller
  dependence improves GNN-based node classification.
