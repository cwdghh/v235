title: 'EvTexture: Event-driven Texture Enhancement for Video Super-Resolution'
openreview: Ry4RAzdOWl
abstract: 'Event-based vision has drawn increasing attention due to its unique characteristics,
  such as high temporal resolution and high dynamic range. It has been used in video
  super-resolution (VSR) recently to enhance the flow estimation and temporal alignment.
  Rather than for motion learning, we propose in this paper the first VSR method that
  utilizes event signals for texture enhancement. Our method, called EvTexture, leverages
  high-frequency details of events to better recover texture regions in VSR. In our
  EvTexture, a new texture enhancement branch is presented. We further introduce an
  iterative texture enhancement module to progressively explore the high-temporal-resolution
  event information for texture restoration. This allows for gradual refinement of
  texture regions across multiple iterations, leading to more accurate and rich high-resolution
  details. Experimental results show that our EvTexture achieves state-of-the-art
  performance on four datasets. For the Vid4 dataset with rich textures, our method
  can get up to 4.67dB gain compared with recent event-based methods. Code: https://github.com/DachunKai/EvTexture.'
