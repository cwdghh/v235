title: 'Whispering Experts: Neural Interventions for Toxicity Mitigation in Language
  Models'
openreview: 2P6GVfSrfZ
abstract: An important issue with Large Language Models (LLMs) is their undesired
  ability to generate toxic language. In this work, we show that the neurons responsible
  for toxicity can be determined by their power to discriminate toxic sentences, and
  that toxic language can be mitigated by reducing their activation levels proportionally
  to this power. We propose AUROC adaptation (AurA), an intervention that can be applied
  to any pre-trained LLM to mitigate toxicity. As the intervention is proportional
  to the ability of each neuron to discriminate toxic content, it is free of any model-dependent
  hyperparameters. We show that AurA can achieve up to $2.2\times$ reduction in toxicity
  with only a $0.72$ perplexity increase. We also show that AurA is effective with
  models of different scale (from 1.5B to 40B parameters), and its effectiveness in
  mitigating toxic language, while preserving common-sense zero-shot abilities, holds
  across all scales. AurA can be combined with pre-prompting strategies, boosting
  its average mitigation potential from $1.28\times$ to $2.35\times$. Moreover, AurA
  can counteract adversarial pre-prompts that maliciously elicit toxic content, making
  it an effective method for deploying safer and less toxic models.
