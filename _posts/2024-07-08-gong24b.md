title: Does Label Smoothing Help Deep Partial Label Learning?
openreview: drjjxmi2Ha
abstract: Although deep partial label learning (deep PLL) classifiers have shown their
  competitive performance, they are heavily influenced by the noisy false-positive
  labels leading to poorer performance as the training progresses. Meanwhile, existing
  deep PLL research lacks theoretical guarantee on the analysis of correlation between
  label noise (or ambiguity degree) and classification performance. This paper addresses
  the above limitations with label smoothing (LS) from both theoretical and empirical
  aspects. In theory, we prove lower and upper bounds of the expected risk to show
  that label smoothing can help deep PLL. We further derive the optimal smoothing
  rate to investigate the conditions, i.e., when label smoothing benefits deep PLL.
  In practice, we design a benchmark solution and a novel optimization algorithm called
  Label Smoothing-based Partial Label Learning (LS-PLL). Extensive experimental results
  on benchmark PLL datasets and various deep architectures validate that label smoothing
  does help deep PLL in improving classification performance and learning distinguishable
  representations, and the best results can be achieved when the empirical smoothing
  rate approximately approaches the optimal smoothing rate in theoretical findings.
