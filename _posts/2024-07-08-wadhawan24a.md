title: 'ConTextual: Evaluating Context-Sensitive Text-Rich Visual Reasoning in Large
  Multimodal Models'
openreview: PjiRSyUt7e
abstract: Many real-world tasks require an agent to reason jointly over text and visual
  objects, (e.g., navigating in public spaces), which we refer to as context-sensitive
  text-rich visual reasoning. Specifically, these tasks require an understanding of
  the context in which the text interacts with visual elements within an image. However,
  there is a lack of existing datasets to benchmark the state-of-the-art multimodal
  modelsâ€™ capability on context-sensitive text-rich visual reasoning. In this paper,
  we introduce ConTextual, a novel dataset featuring human-crafted instructions that
  require context-sensitive reasoning for text-rich images. We conduct experiments
  to assess the performance of 14 foundation models (GPT-4V, Gemini-Pro-Vision, LLaVA-Next)
  and establish a human performance baseline. Further, we perform human evaluations
  of the model responses and observe a significant performance gap of 30.8% between
  GPT-4V (the current best-performing Large Multimodal Model) and human performance.
  Our fine-grained analysis reveals that GPT-4V encounters difficulties interpreting
  time-related data and infographics. However, it demonstrates proficiency in comprehending
  abstract visual contexts such as memes and quotes. Finally, our qualitative analysis
  uncovers various factors contributing to poor performance including lack of precise
  visual perception and hallucinations. Our dataset, code, and leaderboard can be
  found on the project page https://con-textual.github.io/.
