title: A Unified Adaptive Testing System Enabled by Hierarchical Structure Search
openreview: ZFRrOiZruJ
abstract: Adaptive Testing System (ATS) is a promising testing mode, extensively utilized
  in standardized tests like the GRE. It offers personalized ability assessment by
  dynamically adjusting questions based on individual ability levels. Compared to
  traditional exams, ATS can improve the accuracy of ability estimates while simultaneously
  reducing the number of questions required. Despite the diverse testing formats of
  ATS, tailored to different adaptability requirements in various testing scenarios,
  there is a notable absence of a unified framework for modeling them. In this paper,
  we introduce a unified data-driven ATS framework that conceptualizes the various
  testing formats as a hierarchical test structure search problem. It can learn directly
  from data to solve for the optimal questions for each student, eliminating the need
  for manual test design. The proposed solution algorithm comes with theoretical guarantees
  for estimation error and convergence. Empirical results show that our framework
  maintains assessment accuracy while reducing question count by 20% on average and
  improving training stability.
