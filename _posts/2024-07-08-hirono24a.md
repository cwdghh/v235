title: Understanding Diffusion Models by Feynman’s Path Integral
openreview: AEqim4X0NV
abstract: Score-based diffusion models have proven effective in image generation and
  have gained widespread usage; however, the underlying factors contributing to the
  performance disparity between stochastic and deterministic (i.e., the probability
  flow ODEs) sampling schemes remain unclear. We introduce a novel formulation of
  diffusion models using Feynman’s path integral, which is a formulation originally
  developed for quantum physics. We find this formulation providing comprehensive
  descriptions of score-based generative models, and demonstrate the derivation of
  backward stochastic differential equations and loss functions. The formulation accommodates
  an interpolating parameter connecting stochastic and deterministic sampling schemes,
  and we identify this parameter as a counterpart of Planck’s constant in quantum
  physics. This analogy enables us to apply the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (WKB) expansion,
  a well-established technique in quantum physics, for evaluating the negative log-likelihood
  to assess the performance disparity between stochastic and deterministic sampling
  schemes.
