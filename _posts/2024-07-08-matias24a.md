title: Amortized Variational Deep Kernel Learning
openreview: MSMKQuZhD5
abstract: Deep kernel learning (DKL) marries the uncertainty quantification of Gaussian
  processes (GPs) and the representational power of deep neural networks. However,
  training DKL is challenging and often leads to overfitting. Most notably, DKL often
  learns “non-local” kernels — incurring spurious correlations. To remedy this issue,
  we propose using amortized inducing points and a parameter-sharing scheme, which
  ties together the amortization and DKL networks. This design imposes an explicit
  dependency between the ELBO’s model fit and capacity terms. In turn, this prevents
  the former from dominating the optimization procedure and incurring the aforementioned
  spurious correlations. Extensive experiments show that our resulting method, <em>amortized
  varitional</em> DKL (AVDKL), i) consistently outperforms DKL and standard GPs for
  tabular data; ii) achieves significantly higher accuracy than DKL in node classification
  tasks; and iii) leads to substantially better accuracy and negative log-likelihood
  than DKL on CIFAR100.
