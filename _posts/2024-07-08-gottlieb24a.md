title: Weighted distance nearest neighbor condensing
openreview: BoPj12CnAn
abstract: The problem of nearest neighbor condensing has enjoyed a long history of
  study, both in its theoretical and practical aspects. In this paper, we introduce
  the problem of weighted distance nearest neighbor condensing, where one assigns
  weights to each point of the condensed set, and then new points are labeled based
  on their weighted distance nearest neighbor in the condensed set. We study the theoretical
  properties of this new model, and show that it can produce dramatically better condensing
  than the standard nearest neighbor rule, yet is characterized by generalization
  bounds almost identical to the latter. We then suggest a condensing heuristic for
  our new problem. We demonstrate Bayes consistency for this heuristic, and also show
  promising empirical results.
