title: 'Conformalized Survival Distributions: A Generic Post-Process to Increase Calibration'
openreview: jr0W36wOBx
abstract: Discrimination and calibration represent two important properties of survival
  analysis, with the former assessing the model’s ability to accurately rank subjects
  and the latter evaluating the alignment of predicted outcomes with actual events.
  With their distinct nature, it is hard for survival models to simultaneously optimize
  both of them especially as many previous results found improving calibration tends
  to diminish discrimination performance. This paper introduces a novel approach utilizing
  <em>conformal regression</em> that can improve a model’s calibration without degrading
  discrimination. We provide theoretical guarantees for the above claim, and rigorously
  validate the efficiency of our approach across 11 real-world datasets, showcasing
  its practical applicability and robustness in diverse scenarios.
