title: Dynamic Survival Analysis with Controlled Latent States
openreview: xGlVkBSDdt
abstract: We consider the task of learning individual-specific intensities of counting
  processes from a set of static variables and irregularly sampled time series. We
  introduce a novel modelization approach in which the intensity is the solution to
  a controlled differential equation. We first design a neural estimator by building
  on neural controlled differential equations. In a second time, we show that our
  model can be linearized in the signature space under sufficient regularity conditions,
  yielding a signature-based estimator which we call CoxSig. We provide theoretical
  learning guarantees for both estimators, before showcasing the performance of our
  models on a vast array of simulated and real-world datasets from finance, predictive
  maintenance and food supply chain management.
