title: 'CasCast: Skillful High-resolution Precipitation Nowcasting via Cascaded Modelling'
openreview: YuNFJSEkTi
abstract: 'Precipitation nowcasting based on radar data plays a crucial role in extreme
  weather prediction and has broad implications for disaster management. Despite progresses
  have been made based on deep learning, two key challenges of precipitation nowcasting
  are not well-solved: (i) the modeling of complex precipitation system evolutions
  with different scales, and (ii) accurate forecasts for extreme precipitation. In
  this work, we propose CasCast, a cascaded framework composed of a deterministic
  and a probabilistic part to decouple the predictions for mesoscale precipitation
  distributions and small-scale patterns. Then, we explore training the cascaded framework
  at the high resolution and conducting the probabilistic modeling in a low dimensional
  latent space with a frame-wise-guided diffusion transformer for enhancing the optimization
  of extreme events while reducing computational costs. Extensive experiments on three
  benchmark radar precipitation datasets show that CasCast achieves competitive performance.
  Especially, CasCast significantly surpasses the baseline (up to +91.8%) for regional
  extreme-precipitation nowcasting.'
