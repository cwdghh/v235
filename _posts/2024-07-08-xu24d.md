title: Intersectional Unfairness Discovery
openreview: FhWH9TQSMh
abstract: 'AI systems have been shown to produce unfair results for certain subgroups
  of population, highlighting the need to understand bias on certain sensitive attributes.
  Current research often falls short, primarily focusing on the subgroups characterized
  by a single sensitive attribute, while neglecting the nature of intersectional fairness
  of multiple sensitive attributes. This paper focuses on its one fundamental aspect
  by discovering diverse high-bias intersectional sensitive attributes. Specifically,
  we propose a Bias-Guided Generative Network (BGGN). By treating each bias value
  as a reward, BGGN efficiently generates high-bias intersectional sensitive attributes.
  Experiments on real-world text and image datasets demonstrate a diverse and efficient
  discovery of BGGN. To further evaluate the generated unseen but possible unfair
  intersectional sensitive attributes, we formulate them as prompts and use modern
  generative AI to produce new text and images. The results of frequently generating
  biased data provides new insights of discovering potential unfairness in popular
  modern generative AI systems. <b>Warning: This paper contains examples that are
  offensive in nature.</b>'
