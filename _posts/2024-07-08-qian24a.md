title: 'Momentor: Advancing Video Large Language Model with Fine-Grained Temporal
  Reasoning'
openreview: e3geukCBw6
abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable proficiency in comprehending
  and handling text-based tasks. Many efforts are being made to transfer these attributes
  to video modality, which are termed Video-LLMs. However, existing Video-LLMs can
  only capture the coarse-grained semantics and are unable to effectively handle tasks
  related to comprehension or localization of specific video segments. In light of
  these challenges, we propose Momentor, a Video-LLM capable of accomplishing fine-grained
  temporal understanding tasks. To support the training of Momentor, we design an
  automatic data generation engine to construct Moment-10M, a large-scale video instruction
  dataset with segment-level instruction data. We train Momentor on Moment-10M, enabling
  it to perform segment-level reasoning and localization. Zero-shot evaluations on
  several tasks demonstrate that Momentor excels in fine-grained temporally grounded
  comprehension and localization.
