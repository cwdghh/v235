title: 'Complexity Matters: Feature Learning in the Presence of Spurious Correlations'
openreview: 0tuwdgBiSN
abstract: 'Existing research often posits spurious features as <b>easier</b> to learn
  than core features in neural network optimization, but the impact of their relative
  simplicity remains under-explored. Moreover, studies mainly focus on end performance
  rather than the learning dynamics of feature learning. In this paper, we propose
  a theoretical framework and an associated synthetic dataset grounded in boolean
  function analysis. This setup allows for fine-grained control over the relative
  complexity (compared to core features) and correlation strength (with respect to
  the label) of spurious features to study the dynamics of feature learning under
  spurious correlations. Our findings uncover several interesting phenomena: (1) stronger
  spurious correlations or simpler spurious features slow down the learning rate of
  the core features, (2) two distinct subnetworks are formed to learn core and spurious
  features separately, (3) learning phases of spurious and core features are not always
  separable, (4) spurious features are not forgotten even after core features are
  fully learned. We demonstrate that our findings justify the success of retraining
  the last layer to remove spurious correlation and also identifies limitations of
  popular debiasing algorithms that exploit early learning of spurious features. We
  support our empirical findings with theoretical analyses for the case of learning
  XOR features with a one-hidden-layer ReLU network.'
