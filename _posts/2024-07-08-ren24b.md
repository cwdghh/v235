title: 'TabLog: Test-Time Adaptation for Tabular Data Using Logic Rules'
openreview: LZeixIvQcB
abstract: We consider the problem of test-time adaptation of predictive models trained
  on tabular data. Effective solution of this problem requires adaptation of predictive
  models trained on the source domain to a target domain, using only unlabeled target
  domain data, without access to source domain data. Existing test-time adaptation
  methods for tabular data have difficulty coping with the heterogeneous features
  and their complex dependencies inherent in tabular data. To overcome these limitations,
  we consider test-time adaptation in the setting wherein the logical structure of
  the rules is assumed to remain invariant despite distribution shift between source
  and target domains whereas the numerical parameters associated with the rules and
  the weights assigned to them can vary to accommodate distribution shift. TabLog
  discretizes numerical features, models dependencies between heterogeneous features,
  introduces a novel contrastive loss for coping with distribution shift, and presents
  an end-to-end framework for efficient training and test-time adaptation by taking
  advantage of a logical neural network representation of a rule ensemble. We present
  results of experiments using several benchmark data sets that demonstrate TabLog
  is competitive with or improves upon the state-of-the-art methods for test-time
  adaptation of predictive models trained on tabular data. Our code is available at
