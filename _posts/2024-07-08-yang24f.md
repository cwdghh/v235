title: 'Lyapunov-stable Neural Control for State and Output Feedback: A Novel Formulation'
openreview: 3xPMW9JURD
abstract: Learning-based neural-network (NN) control policies have shown impressive
  empirical performance in a wide range of tasks in robotics and control. However,
  formal (Lyapunov) stability guarantees over the region-of-attraction (ROA) for NN
  controllers with nonlinear dynamical systems are challenging to obtain, and most
  existing approaches rely on expensive solvers for sums-of-squares (SOS), mixed-integer
  programming (MIP), or satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). In this paper, we demonstrate
  a new framework for learning NN controllers together with Lyapunov certificates
  using fast empirical falsification and strategic regularizations. We propose a novel
  formulation that defines a larger verifiable region-of-attraction (ROA) than shown
  in the literature, and refines the conventional restrictive constraints on Lyapunov
  derivatives to focus only on certifiable ROAs. The Lyapunov condition is rigorously
  verified post-hoc using branch-and-bound with scalable linear bound propagation-based
  NN verification techniques. The approach is efficient and flexible, and the full
  training and verification procedure is accelerated on GPUs without relying on expensive
  solvers for SOS, MIP, nor SMT. The flexibility and efficiency of our framework allow
  us to demonstrate Lyapunov-stable output feedback control with synthesized NN-based
  controllers and NN-based observers with formal stability guarantees, for the first
  time in literature.
