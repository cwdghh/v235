title: Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning via Function Encoders
openreview: tHBLwSYnLf
abstract: Although reinforcement learning (RL) can solve many challenging sequential
  decision making problems, achieving <em>zero-shot</em> transfer across related tasks
  remains a challenge. The difficulty lies in finding a good representation for the
  current task so that the agent understands how it relates to previously seen tasks.
  To achieve zero-shot transfer, we introduce the <em>function encoder</em>, a representation
  learning algorithm which represents a function as a weighted combination of learned,
  non-linear basis functions. By using a function encoder to represent the reward
  function or the transition function, the agent has information on how the current
  task relates to previously seen tasks via a coherent vector representation. Thus,
  the agent is able to achieve transfer between related tasks at run time with no
  additional training. We demonstrate state-of-the-art data efficiency, asymptotic
  performance, and training stability in three RL fields by augmenting basic RL algorithms
  with a function encoder task representation.
