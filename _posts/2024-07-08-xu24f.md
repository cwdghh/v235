title: 'DisCo-Diff: Enhancing Continuous Diffusion Models with Discrete Latents'
openreview: psup68MBvt
abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized generative learning. They utilize
  a diffusion process to encode data into a simple Gaussian distribution. However,
  encoding a complex, potentially multimodal data distribution into a single <em>continuous</em>
  Gaussian distribution arguably represents an unnecessarily challenging learning
  problem. We propose <b><em>Dis</em>*crete-</b>Co<b>ntinuous Latent Variable </b>Diff<em><em>usion
  Models (DisCo-Diff)</em> to simplify this task by introducing complementary </em>discrete*
  latent variables. We augment DMs with learnable discrete latents, inferred with
  an encoder, and train DM and encoder end-to-end. DisCo-Diff does not rely on pre-trained
  networks, making the framework universally applicable. The discrete latents significantly
  simplify learning the DM’s complex noise-to-data mapping by reducing the curvature
  of the DM’s generative ODE. An additional autoregressive transformer models the
  distribution of the discrete latents, a simple step because DisCo-Diff requires
  only few discrete variables with small codebooks. We validate DisCo-Diff on toy
  data, several image synthesis tasks as well as molecular docking, and find that
  introducing discrete latents consistently improves model performance. For example,
  DisCo-Diff achieves state-of-the-art FID scores on class-conditioned ImageNet-64/128
  datasets with ODE sampler.
