title: Exploring Correlations of Self-Supervised Tasks for Graphs
openreview: O3CFN1VIwt
abstract: Graph self-supervised learning has sparked a research surge in training
  informative representations without accessing any labeled data. However, our understanding
  of graph self-supervised learning remains limited, and the inherent relationships
  between various self-supervised tasks are still unexplored. Our paper aims to provide
  a fresh understanding of graph self-supervised learning based on task correlations.
  Specifically, we evaluate the performance of the representations trained by one
  specific task on other tasks and define correlation values to quantify task correlations.
  Through this process, we unveil the task correlations between various self-supervised
  tasks and can measure their expressive capabilities, which are closely related to
  downstream performance. By analyzing the correlation values between tasks across
  various datasets, we reveal the complexity of task correlations and the limitations
  of existing multi-task learning methods. To obtain more capable representations,
  we propose Graph Task Correlation Modeling (GraphTCM) to illustrate the task correlations
  and utilize it to enhance graph self-supervised training. The experimental results
  indicate that our method significantly outperforms existing methods across various
  downstream tasks.
