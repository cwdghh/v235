title: Few-Shot Unsupervised Implicit Neural Shape Representation Learning with Spatial
  Adversaries
openreview: SLqdDWwibH
abstract: Implicit Neural Representations have gained prominence as a powerful framework
  for capturing complex data modalities, encompassing a wide range from 3D shapes
  to images and audio. Within the realm of 3D shape representation, Neural Signed
  Distance Functions (SDF) have demonstrated remarkable potential in faithfully encoding
  intricate shape geometry. However, learning SDFs from sparse 3D point clouds in
  the absence of ground truth supervision remains a very challenging task. While recent
  methods rely on smoothness priors to regularize the learning, our method introduces
  a regularization term that leverages adversarial samples around the shape to improve
  the learned SDFs. Through extensive experiments and evaluations, we illustrate the
  efficacy of our proposed method, highlighting its capacity to improve SDF learning
  with respect to baselines and the state-of-the-art using synthetic and real data.
