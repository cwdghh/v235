title: 'ELTA: An Enhancer against Long-Tail for Aesthetics-oriented Models'
openreview: dhrNfAJAH6
abstract: Real-world datasets often exhibit long-tailed distributions, compromising
  the generalization and fairness of learning-based models. This issue is particularly
  pronounced in Image Aesthetics Assessment (IAA) tasks, where such imbalance is difficult
  to mitigate due to a severe distribution mismatch between features and labels, as
  well as the great sensitivity of aesthetics to image variations. To address these
  issues, we propose an Enhancer against Long-Tail for Aesthetics-oriented models
  (ELTA). ELTA first utilizes a dedicated mixup technique to enhance minority feature
  representation in high-level space while preserving their intrinsic aesthetic qualities.
  Next, it aligns features and labels through a similarity consistency approach, effectively
  alleviating the distribution mismatch. Finally, ELTA adopts a specific strategy
  to refine the output distribution, thereby enhancing the quality of pseudo-labels.
  Experiments on four representative datasets (AVA, AADB, TAD66K, and PARA) show that
  our proposed ELTA achieves state-of-the-art performance by effectively mitigating
  the long-tailed issue in IAA datasets. Moreover, ELTA is designed with plug-and-play
  capabilities for seamless integration with existing methods. To our knowledge, this
  is the first contribution in the IAA community addressing long-tail. All resources
  are available in here.
