title: Task-aware Orthogonal Sparse Network for Exploring Shared Knowledge in Continual
  Learning
openreview: tABvuya05B
abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to learn from sequentially arriving tasks without
  catastrophic forgetting (CF). By partitioning the network into two parts based on
  the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis—one for holding the knowledge of the old tasks while
  the other for learning the knowledge of the new task—the recent progress has achieved
  forget-free CL. Although addressing the CF issue well, such methods would encounter
  serious under-fitting in long-term CL, in which the learning process will continue
  for a long time and the number of new tasks involved will be much higher. To solve
  this problem, this paper partitions the network into three parts—with a new part
  for exploring the knowledge sharing between the old and new tasks. With the shared
  knowledge, this part of network can be learnt to simultaneously consolidate the
  old tasks and fit to the new task. To achieve this goal, we propose a task-aware
  <b>Orthogonal Sparse Network</b> (OSN), which contains shared knowledge induced
  network partition and sharpness-aware orthogonal sparse network learning. The former
  partitions the network to select shared parameters, while the latter guides the
  exploration of shared knowledge through shared parameters. Qualitative and quantitative
  analyses, show that the proposed OSN induces minimum to no interference with past
  tasks, <em>i.e.</em>, approximately no forgetting, while greatly improves the model
  plasticity and capacity, and finally achieves the state-of-the-art performances.
