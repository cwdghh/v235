title: Improving Gradient-Guided Nested Sampling for Posterior Inference
openreview: K5h6VAsJaV
abstract: We present a performant, general-purpose gradient-guided nested sampling
  (GGNS) algorithm, combining the state of the art in differentiable programming,
  Hamiltonian slice sampling, clustering, mode separation, dynamic nested sampling,
  and parallelization. This unique combination allows GGNS to scale well with dimensionality
  and perform competitively on a variety of synthetic and real-world problems. We
  also show the potential of combining nested sampling with generative flow networks
  to obtain large amounts of high-quality samples from the posterior distribution.
  This combination leads to faster mode discovery and more accurate estimates of the
  partition function.
