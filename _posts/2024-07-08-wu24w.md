title: Profile Reconstruction from Private Sketches
openreview: AqGCEHK9dZ
abstract: Given a multiset of $n$ items from $\mathcal{D}$, the <em>profile reconstruction</em>
  problem is to estimate, for $t = 0, 1, …, n$, the fraction $\vec{f}[t]$ of items
  in $\mathcal{D}$ that appear exactly $t$ times. We consider differentially private
  profile estimation in a distributed, space-constrained setting where we wish to
  maintain an updatable, private sketch of the multiset that allows us to compute
  an approximation of $\vec{f} = (\vec{f}[0], …, \vec{f}[n])$. Using a histogram privatized
  using discrete Laplace noise, we show how to “reverse” the noise using an approach
  of Dwork et al. (ITCS ’10). We show how to speed up the algorithm from polynomial
  time to $O(d + n \log n)$, and analyze the achievable error in the $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$
  and $\ell_\infty$ norms. In all cases the dependency of the error on $d = |\mathcal{D}|$
  is $O( 1 / \sqrt{d})$ — we give an information-theoretic lower bound showing that
  this dependence on $d$ is asymptotically optimal among all private, updatable sketches
  for the profile reconstruction problem with a high-probability error guarantee.
