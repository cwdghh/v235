title: 'Fault Tolerant ML: Efficient Meta-Aggregation and Synchronous Training'
openreview: Ht20wtgaty
abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenging framework of Byzantine-robust
  training in distributed machine learning (ML) systems, focusing on enhancing both
  efficiency and practicality. As distributed ML systems become integral for complex
  ML tasks, ensuring resilience against Byzantine failures—where workers may contribute
  incorrect updates due to malice or error—gains paramount importance. Our first contribution
  is the introduction of the Centered Trimmed Meta Aggregator (CTMA), an efficient
  meta-aggregator that upgrades baseline aggregators to optimal performance levels,
  while requiring low computational demands. Additionally, we propose harnessing a
  recently developed gradient estimation technique based on a double-momentum strategy
  within the Byzantine context. Our paper highlights its theoretical and practical
  advantages for Byzantine-robust training, especially in simplifying the tuning process
  and reducing the reliance on numerous hyperparameters. The effectiveness of this
  technique is supported by theoretical insights within the stochastic convex optimization
  (SCO) framework and corroborated by empirical evidence.
