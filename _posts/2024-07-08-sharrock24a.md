title: 'Sequential Neural Score Estimation: Likelihood-Free Inference with Conditional
  Score Based Diffusion Models'
openreview: 8viuf9PdzU
abstract: We introduce Sequential Neural Posterior Score Estimation (SNPSE), a score-based
  method for Bayesian inference in simulator-based models. Our method, inspired by
  the remarkable success of score-based methods in generative modelling, leverages
  conditional score-based diffusion models to generate samples from the posterior
  distribution of interest. The model is trained using an objective function which
  directly estimates the score of the posterior. We embed the model into a sequential
  training procedure, which guides simulations using the current approximation of
  the posterior at the observation of interest, thereby reducing the simulation cost.
  We also introduce several alternative sequential approaches, and discuss their relative
  merits. We then validate our method, as well as its amortised, non-sequential, variant
  on several numerical examples, demonstrating comparable or superior performance
  to existing state-of-the-art methods such as Sequential Neural Posterior Estimation
  (SNPE).
