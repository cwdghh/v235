title: 'NaturalSpeech 3: Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis with Factorized Codec and Diffusion
  Models'
openreview: dVhrnjZJad
abstract: While recent large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) models have achieved significant
  progress, they still fall shorts in speech quality, similarity, and prosody. Considering
  that speech intricately encompasses various attributes (e.g., content, prosody,
  timbre, and acoustic details) that pose significant challenges for generation, a
  natural idea is to factorize speech into individual subspaces representing different
  attributes and generate them individually. Motivated by it, we propose a TTS system
  with novel factorized diffusion models to generate natural speech in a zero-shot
  way. Specifically, 1) we design a neural codec with factorized vector quantization
  (FVQ) to disentangle speech waveform into subspaces of content, prosody, timbre,
  and acoustic details; 2) we propose a factorized diffusion model, which generates
  attributes in each subspace following its corresponding prompt. With this factorization
  design, our method can effectively and efficiently model the intricate speech with
  disentangled subspaces in a divide-and-conquer way. Experimental results show that
  our method outperforms the state-of-the-art TTS systems on quality, similarity,
  prosody, and intelligibility.
