title: Learning with Adaptive Resource Allocation
openreview: HPLzSCOecY
abstract: 'The study of machine learning under limited resources has gathered increasing
  attention, considering improving the learning efficiency and effectiveness with
  budgeted resources. However, previous efforts mainly focus on <em>single</em> learning
  task, and a common resource-limited scenario is less explored: to handle <em>multiple</em>
  time-constrained learning tasks concurrently with budgeted computational resources.
  In this paper, we point out that this is a very challenging task because it demands
  the learner to be concerned about not only the progress of the learning tasks but
  also the coordinative allocation of computational resources. We present the <em>Learning
  with Adaptive Resource Allocation</em> (LARA) approach, which comprises an efficient
  online estimator for learning progress prediction, an adaptive search method for
  computational resource allocation, and a balancing strategy for alleviating prediction-allocation
  compounding errors. Empirical studies validate the effectiveness of our proposed
  approach.'
