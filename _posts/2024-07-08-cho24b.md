title: Parameterized Physics-informed Neural Networks for Parameterized PDEs
openreview: n3yYrtt9U7
abstract: Complex physical systems are often described by partial differential equations
  (PDEs) that depend on parameters such as the Raynolds number in fluid mechanics.
  In applications such as design optimization or uncertainty quantification, solutions
  of those PDEs need to be evaluated at numerous points in the parameter space. While
  physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a new strong competitor
  as a surrogate, their usage in this scenario remains underexplored due to the inherent
  need for repetitive and time-consuming training. In this paper, we address this
  problem by proposing a novel extension, parameterized physics-informed neural networks
  (P$^2$INNs). P$^2$INNs enable modeling the solutions of parameterized PDEs via explicitly
  encoding a latent representation of PDE parameters. With the extensive empirical
  evaluation, we demonstrate that P$^2$INNs outperform the baselines both in accuracy
  and parameter efficiency on benchmark 1D and 2D parameterized PDEs and are also
  effective in overcoming the known “failure modes”.
