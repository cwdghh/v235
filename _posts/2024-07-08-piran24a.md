title: Contrasting Multiple Representations with the Multi-Marginal Matching Gap
openreview: dV9B9qFeGi
abstract: Learning meaningful representations of complex objects that can be seen
  through multiple ($k\geq 3$) views or modalities is a core task in machine learning.
  Existing methods use losses originally intended for paired views, and extend them
  to $k$ views, either by instantiating $\tfrac12k(k-1)$ loss-pairs, or by using reduced
  embeddings, following a <em>one vs. average-of-rest</em> strategy. We propose the
  multi-marginal matching gap (M3G), a loss that borrows tools from multi-marginal
  optimal transport (MM-OT) theory to simultaneously incorporate all $k$ views. Given
  a batch of $n$ points, each seen as a $k$-tuple of views subsequently transformed
  into $k$ embeddings, our loss contrasts the cost of matching these $n$ ground-truth
  $k$-tuples with the MM-OT polymatching cost, which seeks $n$ optimally arranged
  $k$-tuples chosen within these $n\times k$ vectors. While the exponential complexity
  $O(n^k$) of the MM-OT problem may seem daunting, we show in experiments that a suitable
  generalization of the Sinkhorn algorithm for that problem can scale to, e.g., $k=3\sim
  6$ views using mini-batches of size $64Â \sim128$. Our experiments demonstrate improved
  performance over multiview extensions of pairwise losses, for both self-supervised
  and multimodal tasks.
