title: Differentiable Combinatorial Scheduling at Scale
openreview: 3Pq6uI1MTE
abstract: This paper addresses the complex issue of resource-constrained scheduling,
  an NP-hard problem that spans critical areas including chip design and high-performance
  computing. Traditional scheduling methods often stumble over scalability and applicability
  challenges. We propose a novel approach using a differentiable combinatorial scheduling
  framework, utilizing Gumbel-Softmax differentiable sampling technique. This new
  technical allows for a fully differentiable formulation of linear programming (LP)
  based scheduling, extending its application to a broader range of LP formulations.
  To encode inequality constraints for scheduling tasks, we introduce <em>constrained
  Gumbel Trick</em>, which adeptly encodes arbitrary inequality constraints. Consequently,
  our method facilitates an efficient and scalable scheduling via gradient descent
  without the need for training data. Comparative evaluations on both synthetic and
  real-world benchmarks highlight our capability to significantly improve the optimization
  efficiency of scheduling, surpassing state-of-the-art solutions offered by commercial
  and open-source solvers such as CPLEX, Gurobi, and CP-SAT in the majority of the
  designs.
