title: 'Position: Relational Deep Learning - Graph Representation Learning on Relational
  Databases'
openreview: BIMSHniyCP
abstract: Much of the worldâ€™s most valued data is stored in relational databases and
  data warehouses, where the data is organized into tables connected by primary-foreign
  key relations. However, building machine learning models using this data is both
  challenging and time consuming because no ML algorithm can directly learn from multiple
  connected tables. Current approaches can only learn from a single table, so data
  must first be manually joined and aggregated into this format, the laborious process
  known as feature engineering. Feature engineering is slow, error prone and leads
  to suboptimal models. Here we introduce Relational Deep Learning (RDL), a blueprint
  for end-to-end learning on relational databases. The key is to represent relational
  databases as a temporal, heterogeneous graphs, with a node for each row in each
  table, and edges specified by primary-foreign key links. Graph Neural Networks then
  learn representations that leverage all input data, without any manual feature engineering.
  We also introduce RelBench, and benchmark and testing suite, demonstrating strong
  initial results. Overall, we define a new research area that generalizes graph machine
  learning and broadens its applicability.
