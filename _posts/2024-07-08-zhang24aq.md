title: 'Pessimism Meets Risk: Risk-Sensitive Offline Reinforcement Learning'
openreview: InUUQkExsw
abstract: We study risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL), a crucial field due
  to its ability to enhance decision-making in scenarios where it is essential to
  manage uncertainty and minimize potential adverse outcomes. Particularly, our work
  focuses on applying the entropic risk measure to RL problems. While existing literature
  primarily investigates the online setting, there remains a large gap in understanding
  how to efficiently derive a near-optimal policy based on this risk measure using
  only a pre-collected dataset. We center on the linear Markov Decision Process (MDP)
  setting, a well-regarded theoretical framework that has yet to be examined from
  a risk-sensitive standpoint. In response, we introduce two provably sample-efficient
  algorithms. We begin by presenting a risk-sensitive pessimistic value iteration
  algorithm, offering a tight analysis by leveraging the structure of the risk-sensitive
  performance measure. To further improve the obtained bounds, we propose another
  pessimistic algorithm that utilizes variance information and reference-advantage
  decomposition, effectively improving both the dependence on the space dimension
  $d$ and the risk-sensitivity factor. To the best of our knowledge, we obtain the
  first provably efficient risk-sensitive offline RL algorithms.
