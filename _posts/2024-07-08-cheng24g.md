title: Characterizing Overfitting in Kernel Ridgeless Regression Through the Eigenspectrum
openreview: DRBgNQ2N7U
abstract: 'We derive new bounds for the condition number of kernel matrices, which
  we then use to enhance existing non-asymptotic test error bounds for kernel ridgeless
  regression in the over-parameterized regime for a fixed input dimension. For kernels
  with polynomial spectral decay, we recover the bound from previous work; for exponential
  decay, our bound is non-trivial and novel. Our conclusion is two-fold: (i) kernel
  regressors whose eigenspectrum decays polynomially must generalize well, even in
  the presence of noisy labeled training data; these models exhibit so-called tempered
  overfitting; (ii) if the eigenspectrum of any kernel ridge regressor decays exponentially,
  then it generalizes poorly, i.e., it exhibits catastrophic overfitting. This adds
  to the available characterization of kernel ridge regressors exhibiting benign overfitting
  as the extremal case where the eigenspectrum of the kernel decays sub-polynomially.
  Our analysis combines new random matrix theory (RMT) techniques with recent tools
  in the kernel ridge regression (KRR) literature.'
