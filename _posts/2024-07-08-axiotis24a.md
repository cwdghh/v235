title: 'Data-Efficient Learning via Clustering-Based Sensitivity Sampling: Foundation
  Models and Beyond'
openreview: WUQ4YzIQt2
abstract: We study the data selection problem, whose aim is to select a small representative
  subset of data that can be used to efficiently train a machine learning model. We
  present a new data selection approach based on $k$-means clustering and sensitivity
  sampling. Assuming access to an embedding representation of the data with respect
  to which the model loss is Holder continuous, our approach provably allows selecting
  a set of “typical” $k + 1/\varepsilon^2$ elements whose average loss corresponds
  to the average loss of the whole dataset, up to a multiplicative $(1\pm\varepsilon)$
  factor and an additive $\varepsilon \lambda \Phi_k$, where $\Phi_k$ represents the
  $k$-means cost for the input embeddings and $\lambda$ is the Holder constant. We
  furthermore demonstrate the performance and scalability of our approach on fine-tuning
  foundation models and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We also
  show how it can be applied on linear regression, leading to a new sampling strategy
  that surprisingly matches the performance of leverage score sampling, while being
  conceptually simpler and more scalable.
