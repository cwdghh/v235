title: 'FuRL: Visual-Language Models as Fuzzy Rewards for Reinforcement Learning'
openreview: BmPWtzL7Eq
abstract: 'In this work, we investigate how to leverage pre-trained visual-language
  models (VLM) for online Reinforcement Learning (RL). In particular, we focus on
  sparse reward tasks with pre-defined textual task descriptions. We first identify
  the problem of reward misalignment when applying VLM as a reward in RL tasks. To
  address this issue, we introduce a lightweight fine-tuning method, named Fuzzy VLM
  reward-aided RL (FuRL), based on reward alignment and relay RL. Specifically, we
  enhance the performance of SAC/DrQ baseline agents on sparse reward tasks by fine-tuning
  VLM representations and using relay RL to avoid local minima. Extensive experiments
  on the Meta-world benchmark tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.
