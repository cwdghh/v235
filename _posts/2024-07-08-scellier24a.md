title: A fast algorithm to simulate nonlinear resistive networks
openreview: nAbfF37H6t
abstract: Analog electrical networks have long been investigated as energy-efficient
  computing platforms for machine learning, leveraging analog physics during inference.
  More recently, resistor networks have sparked particular interest due to their ability
  to learn using local rules (such as equilibrium propagation), enabling potentially
  important energy efficiency gains for training as well. Despite their potential
  advantage, the simulations of these resistor networks has been a significant bottleneck
  to assess their scalability, with current methods either being limited to linear
  networks or relying on realistic, yet slow circuit simulators like SPICE. Assuming
  ideal circuit elements, we introduce a novel approach for the simulation of nonlinear
  resistive networks, which we frame as a quadratic programming problem with linear
  inequality constraints, and which we solve using a fast, exact coordinate descent
  algorithm. Our simulation methodology significantly outperforms existing SPICE-based
  simulations, enabling the training of networks up to 327 times larger at speeds
  160 times faster, resulting in a 50,000-fold improvement in the ratio of network
  size to epoch duration. Our approach can foster more rapid progress in the simulations
  of nonlinear analog electrical networks.
