title: 'Learning with Partial-Label and Unlabeled Data: A Uniform Treatment for Supervision
  Redundancy and Insufficiency'
openreview: LmzsgSDkWs
abstract: One major challenge in weakly supervised learning is learning from inexact
  supervision, ranging from partial labels (PLs) with <em>redundant</em> information
  to the extreme of unlabeled data with <em>insufficient</em> information. While recent
  work has made significant strides in specific inexact supervision contexts, supervision
  forms typically <em>coexist</em> in complex combinations. This is exemplified in
  <em>semi-supervised partial label learning</em>, where PLs act as the exclusive
  supervision in a semi-supervised setting. Current strategies addressing combined
  inexact scenarios are usually composite, which can lead to incremental solutions
  that essentially replicate existing methods. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
  to <em>uniformly</em> tackle both label redundancy and insufficiency, derived from
  a mutual information-based perspective. We design a label channel that facilitates
  dynamic label exchange within the candidate label sets, which identifies potential
  true labels and filters out likely incorrect ones, thereby minimizing error accumulation.
  Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art
  PL and semi-supervised learning approaches by directly integrating them. Furthermore,
  our extended experiments on partial-complementary label learning underscore the
  flexibility of our uniform treatment in managing diverse supervision scenarios.
