title: Encodings for Prediction-based Neural Architecture Search
openreview: fqPH6ejwGi
abstract: 'Predictor-based methods have substantially enhanced Neural Architecture
  Search (NAS) optimization. The efficacy of these predictors is largely influenced
  by the method of encoding neural network architectures. While traditional encodings
  used an adjacency matrix describing the graph structure of a neural network, novel
  encodings embrace a variety of approaches from unsupervised pretraining of latent
  representations to vectors of zero-cost proxies. In this paper, we categorize and
  investigate neural encodings from three main types: structural, learned, and score-based.
  Furthermore, we extend these encodings and introduce <em>unified encodings</em>,
  that extend NAS predictors to multiple search spaces. Our analysis draws from experiments
  conducted on over 1.5 million neural network architectures on NAS spaces such as
  NASBench-101 (NB101), NB201, NB301, Network Design Spaces (NDS), and TransNASBench-101.
  Building on our study, we present our predictor <b>FLAN</b>: <b>Fl</b>ow <b>A</b>ttention
  for <b>N</b>AS. FLAN integrates critical insights on predictor design, transfer
  learning, and <em>unified encodings</em> to enable more than an order of magnitude
  cost reduction for training NAS accuracy predictors. Our implementation and encodings
  for all neural networks are open-sourced at https://github.com/abdelfattah-lab/flan_nas.'
