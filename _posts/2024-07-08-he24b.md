title: Deep Neural Room Acoustics Primitive
openreview: c2CKmP9l5X
abstract: The primary objective of room acoustics is to model the intricate sound
  propagation dynamics from any source to receiver position within enclosed 3D spaces.
  These dynamics are encapsulated in the form of a 1D room impulse response (RIR).
  Precisely measuring RIR is difficult due to the complexity of sound propagation
  encompassing reflection, diffraction, and absorption. In this work, we propose to
  learn a continuous neural room acoustics field that implicitly encodes all essential
  sound propagation primitives for each enclosed 3D space, so that we can infer the
  RIR corresponding to arbitrary source-receiver positions unseen in the training
  dataset. Our framework, dubbed DeepNeRAP, is trained in a self-supervised manner
  without requiring direct access to RIR ground truth that is often needed in prior
  methods. The key idea is to design two cooperative acoustic agents to actively probe
  a 3D space, one emitting and the other receiving sound at various locations. Analyzing
  this sound helps to inversely characterize the acoustic primitives. Our framework
  is well-grounded in the fundamental physical principles of sound propagation, including
  reciprocity and globality, and thus is acoustically interpretable and meaningful.
  We present experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating
  superior quality in RIR estimation against closely related methods.
