title: 'Multi-Track Message Passing: Tackling Oversmoothing and Oversquashing in Graph
  Learning via Preventing Heterophily Mixing'
openreview: 1sRuv4cnuZ
abstract: 'The advancement toward deeper graph neural networks is currently obscured
  by two inherent issues in message passing, <em>oversmoothing</em> and <em>oversquashing</em>.
  We identify the root cause of these issues as information loss due to <em>heterophily
  mixing</em> in aggregation, where messages of diverse category semantics are mixed.
  We propose a novel multi-track graph convolutional network to address oversmoothing
  and oversquashing effectively. Our basic idea is intuitive: if messages are separated
  and independently propagated according to their category semantics, heterophilic
  mixing can be prevented. Consequently, we present a novel multi-track message passing
  scheme capable of preventing heterophilic mixing, enhancing long-distance information
  flow, and improving separation condition. Empirical validations show that our model
  achieved state-of-the-art performance on several graph datasets and effectively
  tackled oversmoothing and oversquashing, setting a new benchmark of $86.4$% accuracy
  on Cora.'
