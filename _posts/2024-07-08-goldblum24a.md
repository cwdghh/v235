title: 'Position: The No Free Lunch Theorem, Kolmogorov Complexity, and the Role of
  Inductive Biases in Machine Learning'
openreview: EaJ7nqJ2Fa
abstract: No free lunch theorems for supervised learning state that no learner can
  solve all problems or that all learners achieve exactly the same accuracy on average
  over a uniform distribution on learning problems. Accordingly, these theorems are
  often referenced in support of the notion that individual problems require specially
  tailored inductive biases. While virtually all uniformly sampled datasets have high
  complexity, real-world problems disproportionately generate low-complexity data,
  and we argue that neural network models share this same preference, formalized using
  Kolmogorov complexity. Notably, we show that architectures designed for a particular
  domain, such as computer vision, can compress datasets on a variety of seemingly
  unrelated domains. Our experiments show that pre-trained and even randomly initialized
  language models prefer to generate low-complexity sequences. Whereas no free lunch
  theorems seemingly indicate that individual problems require specialized learners,
  we explain how tasks that often require human intervention such as picking an appropriately
  sized model when labeled data is scarce or plentiful can be automated into a single
  learning algorithm. These observations justify the trend in deep learning of unifying
  seemingly disparate problems with an increasingly small set of machine learning
  models.
