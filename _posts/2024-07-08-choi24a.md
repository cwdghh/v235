title: Scalable Wasserstein Gradient Flow for Generative Modeling through Unbalanced
  Optimal Transport
openreview: dMhF96PfQi
abstract: Wasserstein gradient flow (WGF) describes the gradient dynamics of probability
  density within the Wasserstein space. WGF provides a promising approach for conducting
  optimization over the probability distributions. Numerically approximating the continuous
  WGF requires the time discretization method. The most well-known method for this
  is the JKO scheme. In this regard, previous WGF models employ the JKO scheme and
  parametrized transport map for each JKO step. However, this approach results in
  quadratic training complexity $O(K^2)$ with the number of JKO step $K$. This severely
  limits the scalability of WGF models. In this paper, we introduce a scalable WGF-based
  generative model, called Semi-dual JKO (S-JKO). Our model is based on the semi-dual
  form of the JKO step, derived from the equivalence between the JKO step and the
  Unbalanced Optimal Transport. Our approach reduces the training complexity to $O(K)$.
  We demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing WGF-based generative
  models, achieving FID scores of 2.62 on CIFAR-10 and 6.42 on CelebA-HQ-256, which
  are comparable to state-of-the-art image generative models.
