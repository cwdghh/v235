title: Conformal Prediction for Deep Classifier via Label Ranking
openreview: b3pYoZfcoo
abstract: Conformal prediction is a statistical framework that generates prediction
  sets containing ground-truth labels with a desired coverage guarantee. The predicted
  probabilities produced by machine learning models are generally miscalibrated, leading
  to large prediction sets in conformal prediction. To address this issue, we propose
  a novel algorithm named $\textit{Sorted Adaptive Prediction Sets}$ (SAPS), which
  discards all the probability values except for the maximum softmax probability.
  The key idea behind SAPS is to minimize the dependence of the non-conformity score
  on the probability values while retaining the uncertainty information. In this manner,
  SAPS can produce compact prediction sets and communicate instance-wise uncertainty.
  Extensive experiments validate that SAPS not only lessens the prediction sets but
  also broadly enhances the conditional coverage rate of prediction sets.
