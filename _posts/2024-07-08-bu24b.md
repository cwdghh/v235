title: 'Tackling Prevalent Conditions in Unsupervised Combinatorial Optimization:
  Cardinality, Minimum, Covering, and More'
openreview: 6n99bIxb3r
abstract: 'Combinatorial optimization (CO) is naturally discrete, making machine-learning
  techniques based on differentiable optimization inapplicable. Karalias & Loukas
  (2020) adapted the probabilistic method by Erd≈ës & Spencer (1974), to incorporate
  CO into differentiable optimization. Their work ignited the research on unsupervised
  learning for CO, composed of two main components: probabilistic objectives and derandomization.
  However, each component confronts unique challenges. First, deriving objectives
  under complex conditions and constraints is nontrivial. Second, the derandomization
  process is underexplored, and the existing derandomization methods are either random
  sampling or naive rounding. In this work, we aim to tackle complex conditions in
  unsupervised CO. First, we concretize the targets for probabilistic objective construction
  and derandomization with theoretical justification. Then, for various complex conditions
  commonly involved in different CO problems, we derive nontrivial objectives and
  derandomization to meet the targets. Finally, we apply the derivations to various
  CO problems. Via extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world graphs, we validate
  the correctness of our derivations and show our empirical superiority w.r.t. both
  optimization quality and speed.'
