title: Best Arm Identification for Stochastic Rising Bandits
openreview: WwLtwPHmSM
abstract: Stochastic Rising Bandits (SRBs) model sequential decision-making problems
  in which the expected reward of the available options increases every time they
  are selected. This setting captures a wide range of scenarios in which the available
  options are learning entities whose performance improves (in expectation) over time
  (e.g., online best model selection). While previous works addressed the regret minimization
  problem, this paper focuses on the fixed-budget Best Arm Identification (BAI) problem
  for SRBs. In this scenario, given a fixed budget of rounds, we are asked to provide
  a recommendation about the best option at the end of the identification process.
  We propose two algorithms to tackle the above-mentioned setting, namely R-UCBE,
  which resorts to a UCB-like approach, and R-SR, which employs a successive reject
  procedure. Then, we prove that, with a sufficiently large budget, they provide guarantees
  on the probability of properly identifying the optimal option at the end of the
  learning process and on the simple regret. Furthermore, we derive a lower bound
  on the error probability, matched by our R-SR (up to constants), and illustrate
  how the need for a sufficiently large budget is unavoidable in the SRB setting.
  Finally, we numerically validate the proposed algorithms in both synthetic and realistic
  environments.
