title: Provable Risk-Sensitive Distributional Reinforcement Learning with General
  Function Approximation
openreview: 0xmfExPqFf
abstract: 'In the realm of reinforcement learning (RL), accounting for risk is crucial
  for making decisions under uncertainty, particularly in applications where safety
  and reliability are paramount. In this paper, we introduce a general framework on
  Risk-Sensitive Distributional Reinforcement Learning (RS-DisRL), with static Lipschitz
  Risk Measures (LRM) and general function approximation. Our framework covers a broad
  class of risk-sensitive RL, and facilitates analysis of the impact of estimation
  functions on the effectiveness of RSRL strategies and evaluation of their sample
  complexity. We design two innovative meta-algorithms: RS-DisRL-M, a model-based
  strategy for model-based function approximation, and RS-DisRL-V, a model-free approach
  for general value function approximation. With our novel estimation techniques via
  Least Squares Regression (LSR) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) in distributional
  RL with augmented Markov Decision Process (MDP), we derive the first $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{K})$
  dependency of the regret upper bound for RSRL with static LRM, marking a pioneering
  contribution towards statistically efficient algorithms in this domain.'
