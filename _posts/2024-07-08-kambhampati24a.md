title: 'Position: LLMs Can’t Plan, But Can Help Planning in LLM-Modulo Frameworks'
openreview: Th8JPEmH4z
abstract: We argue that auto-regressive LLMs cannot, by themselves, do planning or
  self-verification (which is after all a form of reasoning), and shed some light
  on the reasons for misunderstandings in the literature. We will also argue that
  LLMs should be viewed as universal approximate knowledge sources that have much
  more meaningful roles to play in planning/reasoning tasks beyond simple front-end/back-end
  format translators. We present a vision of LLM-Modulo Frameworks that combine the
  strengths of LLMs with external model-based verifiers in a tighter bi-directional
  interaction regime. We will show how the models driving the external verifiers themselves
  can be acquired with the help of LLMs. We will also argue that rather than simply
  pipelining LLMs and symbolic components, this LLM-Modulo Framework provides a better
  neuro-symbolic approach that offers tighter integration between LLMs and symbolic
  components, and allows extending the scope of model-based planning/reasoning regimes
  towards more flexible knowledge, problem and preference specifications.
