title: 'Position: Insights from Survey Methodology can Improve Training Data'
openreview: c3ls5AVOw7
abstract: Whether future AI models are fair, trustworthy, and aligned with the publicâ€™s
  interests rests in part on our ability to collect accurate data about what we want
  the models to do. However, collecting high-quality data is difficult, and few AI/ML
  researchers are trained in data collection methods. Recent research in data-centric
  AI has show that higher quality training data leads to better performing models,
  making this the right moment to introduce AI/ML researchers to the field of survey
  methodology, the science of data collection. We summarize insights from the survey
  methodology literature and discuss how they can improve the quality of training
  and feedback data. We also suggest collaborative research ideas into how biases
  in data collection can be mitigated, making models more accurate and human-centric.
