title: Latent Logic Tree Extraction for Event Sequence Explanation from LLMs
openreview: pwfcwEqdUz
abstract: Modern high-stakes systems, such as healthcare or robotics, often generate
  vast streaming event sequences. Our goal is to design an efficient, plug-and-play
  tool to elicit logic tree-based explanations from Large Language Models (LLMs) to
  provide customized insights into each observed event sequence. Built on the temporal
  point process model for events, our method employs the likelihood function as a
  score to evaluate generated logic trees. We propose an amortized Expectation-Maximization
  (EM) learning framework and treat the logic tree as latent variables. In the E-step,
  we evaluate the posterior distribution over the latent logic trees using an LLM
  prior and the likelihood of the observed event sequences. LLM provides a high-quality
  prior for the latent logic trees, however, since the posterior is built over a discrete
  combinatorial space, we cannot get the closed-form solution. We propose to generate
  logic tree samples from the posterior using a learnable GFlowNet, which is a diversity-seeking
  generator for structured discrete variables. The M-step employs the generated logic
  rules to approximate marginalization over the posterior, facilitating the learning
  of model parameters and refining the tunable LLM prior parameters. In the online
  setting, our locally built, lightweight model will iteratively extract the most
  relevant rules from LLMs for each sequence using only a few iterations. Empirical
  demonstrations showcase the promising performance and adaptability of our framework.
