title: Scalable Online Exploration via Coverability
openreview: C64clssMVU
abstract: 'Exploration is a major challenge in reinforcement learning, especially
  for high-dimensional domains that require function approximation. We propose exploration
  objectives—policy optimization objectives that enable downstream maximization of
  any reward function—as a conceptual framework to systematize the study of exploration.
  We introduce a new objective, L1-Coverage, which generalizes previous exploration
  schemes and supports three fundamental desiderata: 1. <em>Intrinsic complexity control.</em>
  L1-Coverage is associated with a structural parameter, L1-Coverability, which reflects
  the intrinsic statistical difficulty of the underlying MDP, subsuming Block and
  Low-Rank MDPs. 2. <em>Efficient planning.</em> For a known MDP, L1-Coverage efficiently
  reduces to standard policy optimization, allowing flexible integration with off-the-shelf
  methods such as policy gradient and Q-learning approaches. 3. <em>Efficient exploration.</em>
  L1-Coverage enables the first computationally efficient model-based and model-free
  algorithms for online (reward-free or reward-driven) reinforcement learning in MDPs
  with low coverability. Empirically, we find that L1-Coverage effectively drives
  off-the-shelf policy optimization algorithms to explore the state space.'
