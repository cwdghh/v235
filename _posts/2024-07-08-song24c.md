title: 'SurfPro: Functional Protein Design Based on Continuous Surface'
openreview: a8QpoEJCRI
abstract: 'How can we design proteins with desired functions? We are motivated by
  a chemical intuition that both geometric structure and biochemical properties are
  critical to a proteinâ€™s function. In this paper, we propose SurfPro, a new method
  to generate functional proteins given a desired surface and its associated biochemical
  properties. SurfPro comprises a hierarchical encoder that progressively models the
  geometric shape and biochemical features of a protein surface, and an autoregressive
  decoder to produce an amino acid sequence. We evaluate SurfPro on a standard inverse
  folding benchmark CATH 4.2 and two functional protein design tasks: protein binder
  design and enzyme design. Our SurfPro consistently surpasses previous state-of-the-art
  inverse folding methods, achieving a recovery rate of 57.78% on CATH 4.2 and higher
  success rates in terms of protein-protein binding and enzyme-substrate interaction
  scores'
