title: 'SHINE: Shielding Backdoors in Deep Reinforcement Learning'
openreview: nMWxLnSBGW
abstract: Recent studies have discovered that a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
  policy is vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing defenses against backdoor attacks
  either do not consider RL’s unique mechanism or make unrealistic assumptions, resulting
  in limited defense efficacy, practicability, and generalizability. We propose SHINE,
  a backdoor shielding method specific for DRL. SHINE designs novel policy explanation
  techniques to identify the backdoor triggers and a policy retraining algorithm to
  eliminate the impact of the triggers on backdoored agents. We theoretically justify
  that SHINE guarantees to improve a backdoored agent’s performance in a poisoned
  environment while ensuring its performance difference in the clean environment before
  and after shielding is bounded. We further conduct extensive experiments that evaluate
  SHINE against three mainstream DRL backdoor attacks in various benchmark RL environments.
  Our results show that SHINE significantly outperforms existing defenses in mitigating
  these backdoor attacks.
