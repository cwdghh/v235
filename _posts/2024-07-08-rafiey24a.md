title: Decomposable Submodular Maximization in Federated Setting
openreview: SAbZExIIgG
abstract: Submodular functions, as well as the sub-class of decomposable submodular
  functions, and their optimization appear in a wide range of applications in machine
  learning, recommendation systems, and welfare maximization. However, optimization
  of decomposable submodular functions with millions of component functions is computationally
  prohibitive. Furthermore, the component functions may be private (they might represent
  user preference function, for example) and cannot be widely shared. To address these
  issues, we propose a <em>federated optimization</em> setting for decomposable submodular
  optimization. In this setting, clients have their own preference functions, and
  a weighted sum of these preferences needs to be maximized. We implement the popular
  <em>continuous greedy</em> algorithm in this setting where clients take parallel
  small local steps towards the local solution and then the local changes are aggregated
  at a central server. To address the large number of clients, the aggregation is
  performed only on a subsampled set. Further, the aggregation is performed only intermittently
  between stretches of parallel local steps, which reduces communication cost significantly.
  We show that our federated algorithm is guaranteed to provide a good approximate
  solution, even in the presence of above cost-cutting measures. Finally, we show
  how the federated setting can be incorporated in solving fundamental discrete submodular
  optimization problems such as Maximum Coverage and Facility Location.
