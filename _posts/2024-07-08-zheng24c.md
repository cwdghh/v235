title: 'Exploiting Negative Samples: A Catalyst for Cohort Discovery in Healthcare
  Analytics'
openreview: k1J2GbamLi
abstract: In healthcare analytics, addressing binary diagnosis or prognosis tasks
  presents unique challenges due to the inherent asymmetry between positive and negative
  samples. While positive samples, indicating patients with a disease, are defined
  based on stringent medical criteria, negative samples are defined in an open-ended
  manner and remain underexplored in prior research. To bridge this gap, we propose
  an innovative approach to facilitate cohort discovery within negative samples, leveraging
  a Shapley-based exploration of interrelationships between these samples, which holds
  promise for uncovering valuable insights concerning the studied disease, and related
  comorbidity and complications. We quantify each sampleâ€™s contribution using data
  Shapley values, subsequently constructing the Negative Sample Shapley Field to model
  the distribution of all negative samples. Next, we transform this field through
  manifold learning, preserving the essential data structure information while imposing
  an isotropy constraint in data Shapley values. Within this transformed space, we
  pinpoint cohorts of medical interest via density-based clustering. We empirically
  evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on the real-world electronic medical
  records from National University Hospital in Singapore, yielding clinically valuable
  insights aligned with existing knowledge, and benefiting medical research and clinical
  decision-making.
