title: Improving Instruction Following in Language Models through Proxy-Based Uncertainty
  Estimation
openreview: eCCaHZKdl4
abstract: Assessing response quality to instructions in language models is vital but
  challenging due to the complexity of human language across different contexts. This
  complexity often results in ambiguous or inconsistent interpretations, making accurate
  assessment difficult. To address this issue, we propose a novel Uncertainty-aware
  Reward Model (URM) that introduces a robust uncertainty estimation for the quality
  of paired responses based on Bayesian approximation. Trained with preference datasets,
  our uncertainty-enabled proxy not only scores rewards for responses but also evaluates
  their inherent uncertainty. Empirical results demonstrate significant benefits of
  incorporating the proposed proxy into language model training. Our method boosts
  the instruction following capability of language models by refining data curation
  for training and improving policy optimization objectives, thereby surpassing existing
  methods by a large margin on benchmarks such as Vicuna and MT-bench. These findings
  highlight that our proposed approach substantially advances language model training
  and paves a new way of harnessing uncertainty within language models.
