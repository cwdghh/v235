title: Learning Decision Policies with Instrumental Variables through Double Machine
  Learning
openreview: iRcmqXZjeK
abstract: A common issue in learning decision-making policies in data-rich settings
  is spurious correlations in the offline dataset, which can be caused by hidden confounders.
  Instrumental variable (IV) regression, which utilises a key uncounfounded variable
  called the instrument, is a standard technique for learning causal relationships
  between confounded action, outcome and context variables. Most recent IV regression
  algorithms use a two-stage approach, where a deep neural network (DNN) estimator
  learnt in the first stage is directly plugged into the second stage, in which another
  DNN is used to estimate the causal effect. Naively plugging the estimator can cause
  heavy bias in the second stage, especially when regularisation bias is present in
  the first stage estimator. We propose DML-IV, a non-linear IV regression method
  that reduces the bias in two-stage IV regressions and effectively learns high-performing
  policies. We derive a novel learning objective to reduce bias and design the DML-IV
  algorithm following the double/debiased machine learning (DML) framework. The learnt
  DML-IV estimator has strong convergence rate and $O(N^{-1/2})$ suboptimality guarantees
  that match those when the dataset is unconfounded. DML-IV outperforms state-of-the-art
  IV regression methods on IV regression benchmarks and learns high-performing policies
  in the presence of instruments.
