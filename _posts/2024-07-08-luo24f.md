title: 'Position: Reinforcement Learning in Dynamic Treatment Regimes Needs Critical
  Reexamination'
openreview: xtKWwB6lzT
abstract: In the rapidly changing healthcare landscape, the implementation of offline
  reinforcement learning (RL) in dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) presents a mix of
  unprecedented opportunities and challenges. This position paper offers a critical
  examination of the current status of offline RL in the context of DTRs. We argue
  for a reassessment of applying RL in DTRs, citing concerns such as inconsistent
  and potentially inconclusive evaluation metrics, the absence of naive and supervised
  learning baselines, and the diverse choice of RL formulation in existing research.
  Through a case study with more than 17,000 evaluation experiments using a publicly
  available Sepsis dataset, we demonstrate that the performance of RL algorithms can
  significantly vary with changes in evaluation metrics and Markov Decision Process
  (MDP) formulations. Surprisingly, it is observed that in some instances, RL algorithms
  can be surpassed by random baselines subjected to policy evaluation methods and
  reward design. This calls for more careful policy evaluation and algorithm development
  in future DTR works. Additionally, we discussed potential enhancements toward more
  reliable development of RL-based dynamic treatment regimes and invited further discussion
  within the community. Code is available at https://github.com/GilesLuo/ReassessDTR.
