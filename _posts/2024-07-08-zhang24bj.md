title: 'Switchable Decision: Dynamic Neural Generation Networks'
openreview: LGhtl9ktop
abstract: Auto-regressive generation models achieve competitive performance across
  many different NLP tasks such as summarization, question answering, and classifications.
  However, they are also known for being slow in inference, which makes them challenging
  to deploy in real-time applications. We propose a switchable decision to accelerate
  inference by dynamically assigning computation resources for each data instance.
  Automatically making decisions on where to skip and how to balance quality and computation
  cost with constrained optimization, our dynamic neural generation networks enforce
  the efficient inference path and determine the optimized trade-off. Experiments
  across question answering, summarization, and classification benchmarks show that
  our method benefits from less computation cost during inference while keeping the
  same accuracy. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our method
  can be general, effective, and beneficial for many NLP tasks.
