  Learning'
openreview: NbOlmrB59Z
abstract: 'Recent advancements in semi-supervised learning have focused on a more
  realistic yet challenging task: addressing imbalances in labeled data while the
  class distribution of unlabeled data remains both unknown and potentially mismatched.
  Current approaches in this sphere often presuppose rigid assumptions regarding the
  class distribution of unlabeled data, thereby limiting the adaptability of models
  to only certain distribution ranges. In this study, we propose a novel approach,
  introducing a highly adaptable framework, designated as <b>SimPro</b>, which does
  not rely on any predefined assumptions about the distribution of unlabeled data.
  Our framework, grounded in a probabilistic model, innovatively refines the expectation-maximization
  (EM) method by separating the modeling of conditional and marginal class distributions.
  This separation facilitates a closed-form solution for class distribution estimation
  during the maximization phase, leading to the formulation of a Bayes classifier.
  The Bayes classifier, in turn, enhances the quality of pseudo-labels in the expectation
  phase. Remarkably, the SimPro framework is not only straightforward to implement
  but also comes with theoretical guarantees. Moreover, we introduce two novel class
  distributions broadening the scope of the evaluation. Our method showcases consistent
  state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks and data distribution scenarios.
