title: 'In-Context Decision Transformer: Reinforcement Learning via Hierarchical Chain-of-Thought'
openreview: jmmji1EU3g
abstract: In-context learning is a promising approach for offline reinforcement learning
  (RL) to handle online tasks, which can be achieved by providing task prompts. Recent
  works demonstrated that in-context RL could emerge with self-improvement in a trial-and-error
  manner when treating RL tasks as an across-episodic sequential prediction problem.
  Despite the self-improvement not requiring gradient updates, current works still
  suffer from high computational costs when the across-episodic sequence increases
  with task horizons. To this end, we propose an In-context Decision Transformer (IDT)
  to achieve self-improvement in a high-level trial-and-error manner. Specifically,
  IDT is inspired by the efficient hierarchical structure of human decision-making
  and thus reconstructs the sequence to consist of high-level decisions instead of
  low-level actions that interact with environments. As one high-level decision can
  guide multi-step low-level actions, IDT naturally avoids excessively long sequences
  and solves online tasks more efficiently. Experimental results show that IDT achieves
  state-of-the-art in long-horizon tasks over current in-context RL methods. In particular,
  the online evaluation time of our IDT is 36$\times$ times faster than baselines
  in the D4RL benchmark and 27$\times$ times faster in the Grid World benchmark.
