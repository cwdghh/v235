title: Expert Proximity as Surrogate Rewards for Single Demonstration Imitation Learning
openreview: gzis9n5r7e
abstract: In this paper, we focus on single-demonstration imitation learning (IL),
  a practical approach for real-world applications where acquiring multiple expert
  demonstrations is costly or infeasible and the ground truth reward function is not
  available. In contrast to typical IL settings with multiple demonstrations, single-demonstration
  IL involves an agent having access to only one expert trajectory. We highlight the
  issue of sparse reward signals in this setting and propose to mitigate this issue
  through our proposed Transition Discriminator-based IL (TDIL) method. TDIL is an
  IRL method designed to address reward sparsity by introducing a denser surrogate
  reward function that considers environmental dynamics. This surrogate reward function
  encourages the agent to navigate towards states that are proximal to expert states.
  In practice, TDIL trains a transition discriminator to differentiate between valid
  and non-valid transitions in a given environment to compute the surrogate rewards.
  The experiments demonstrate that TDIL outperforms existing IL approaches and achieves
  expert-level performance in the single-demonstration IL setting across five widely
  adopted MuJoCo benchmarks as well as the "Adroit Door" robotic environment.
