title: 'See More Details: Efficient Image Super-Resolution by Experts Mining'
openreview: 0JXGusc7E2
abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) inputs
  poses a significant challenge in image super-resolution (SR). While recent approaches
  have demonstrated the efficacy of intricate operations customized for various objectives,
  the straightforward stacking of these disparate operations can result in a substantial
  computational burden, hampering their practical utility. In response, we introduce
  SeemoRe, an efficient SR model employing expert mining. Our approach strategically
  incorporates experts at different levels, adopting a collaborative methodology.
  At the macro scale, our experts address rank-wise and spatial-wise informative features,
  providing a holistic understanding. Subsequently, the model delves into the subtleties
  of rank choice by leveraging a mixture of low-rank experts. By tapping into experts
  specialized in distinct key factors crucial for accurate SR, our model excels in
  uncovering intricate intra-feature details. This collaborative approach is reminiscent
  of the concept of â€œsee more", allowing our model to achieve an optimal performance
  with minimal computational costs in efficient settings.
