title: An Unsupervised Approach for Periodic Source Detection in Time Series
openreview: bwZlD7mYoa
abstract: Detection of periodic patterns of interest within noisy time series data
  plays a critical role in various tasks, spanning from health monitoring to behavior
  analysis. Existing learning techniques often rely on labels or clean versions of
  signals for detecting the periodicity, and those employing self-supervised methods
  are required to apply proper augmentations, which is already challenging for time
  series and can result in collapse—all representations collapse to a single point
  due to strong augmentation. In this work, we propose a novel method to detect the
  periodicity in time series without the need for any labels or requiring tailored
  positive or negative data generation mechanisms. We mitigate the collapse issue
  by ensuring the learned representations retain information from the original samples
  without imposing any variance constraints on the batch. Our experiments in three
  time-series tasks against state-of-the-art learning methods show that the proposed
  approach consistently outperforms prior works, achieving performance improvements
  of more than 45–50%, showing its effectiveness.
