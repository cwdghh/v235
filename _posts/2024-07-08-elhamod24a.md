title: 'Neuro-Visualizer: A Novel Auto-Encoder-Based Loss Landscape Visualization
  Method With an Application in Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning'
openreview: XiemSZpvh0
abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in visualizing the loss
  landscape of neural networks. Linear landscape visualization methods, such as principal
  component analysis, have become widely used as they intuitively help researchers
  study neural networks and their training process. However, these linear methods
  suffer from limitations and drawbacks due to their lack of flexibility and low fidelity
  at representing the high dimensional landscape. In this paper, we present a novel
  auto-encoder-based non-linear landscape visualization method called Neuro-Visualizer
  that addresses these shortcoming and provides useful insights about neural network
  loss landscapes. To demonstrate its potential, we run experiments on a variety of
  problems in two separate applications of knowledge-guided machine learning (KGML).
  Our findings show that Neuro-Visualizer outperforms other linear and non-linear
  baselines and helps corroborate, and sometime challenge, claims proposed by machine
  learning community. All code and data used in the experiments of this paper can
  be found at the link below.
