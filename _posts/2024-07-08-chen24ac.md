title: 'GeoMFormer: A General Architecture for Geometric Molecular Representation
  Learning'
openreview: Y5Zi59N265
abstract: Molecular modeling, a central topic in quantum mechanics, aims to accurately
  calculate the properties and simulate the behaviors of molecular systems. The molecular
  model is governed by physical laws, which impose geometric constraints such as invariance
  and equivariance to coordinate rotation and translation. While numerous deep learning
  approaches have been developed to learn molecular representations under these constraints,
  most of them are built upon heuristic and costly modules. We argue that there is
  a strong need for a general and flexible framework for learning both invariant and
  equivariant features. In this work, we introduce a novel Transformer-based molecular
  model called GeoMFormer to achieve this goal. Using the standard Transformer modules,
  two separate streams are developed to maintain and learn invariant and equivariant
  representations. Carefully designed <em>cross-attention</em> modules bridge the
  two streams, allowing information fusion and enhancing geometric modeling in each
  stream. As a general and flexible architecture, we show that many previous architectures
  can be viewed as special instantiations of GeoMFormer. Extensive experiments are
  conducted to demonstrate the power of GeoMFormer. All empirical results show that
  GeoMFormer achieves strong performance on both invariant and equivariant tasks of
  different types and scales. Code and models will be made publicly available at https://github.com/c-tl/GeoMFormer.
