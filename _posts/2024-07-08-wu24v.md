title: Learning Divergence Fields for Shift-Robust Graph Representations
openreview: jPaEOH56JB
abstract: Real-world data generation often involves certain geometries (e.g., graphs)
  that induce instance-level interdependence. This characteristic makes the generalization
  of learning models more difficult due to the intricate interdependent patterns that
  impact data-generative distributions and can vary from training to testing. In this
  work, we propose a geometric diffusion model with learnable divergence fields for
  the challenging generalization problem with interdependent data. We generalize the
  diffusion equation with stochastic diffusivity at each time step, which aims to
  capture the multi-faceted information flows among interdependent data. Furthermore,
  we derive a new learning objective through causal inference, which can guide the
  model to learn generalizable patterns of interdependence that are insensitive across
  domains. Regarding practical implementation, we introduce three model instantiations
  that can be considered as the generalized versions of GCN, GAT, and Transformers,
  respectively, which possess advanced robustness against distribution shifts. We
  demonstrate their promising efficacy for out-of-distribution generalization on diverse
  real-world datasets. Source codes are available at https://github.com/fannie1208/GLIND.
