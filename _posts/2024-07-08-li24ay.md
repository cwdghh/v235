title: 'PID: Prompt-Independent Data Protection Against Latent Diffusion Models'
openreview: 1N7pjXKkx8
abstract: The few-shot fine-tuning of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) has enabled them
  to grasp new concepts from a limited number of images. However, given the vast amount
  of personal images accessible online, this capability raises critical concerns about
  civil privacy. While several previous defense methods have been developed to prevent
  such misuse of LDMs, they typically assume that the textual prompts used by data
  protectors exactly match those employed by data exploiters. In this paper, we first
  empirically demonstrate that breaking this assumption, i.e., in cases where discrepancies
  exist between the textual conditions used by protectors and exploiters, could substantially
  reduces the effectiveness of these defenses. Furthermore, considering the visual
  encoderâ€™s independence from textual prompts, we delve into the visual encoder and
  thoroughly investigate how manipulating the visual encoder affects the few-shot
  fine-tuning process of LDMs. Drawing on these insights, we propose a simple yet
  effective method called Prompt-Independent Defense (PID) to safeguard privacy against
  LDMs. We show that PID can act as a strong privacy shield on its own while requiring
  significantly less computational power. We believe our studies, along with the comprehensive
  understanding and new defense method, provide a notable advance toward reliable
  data protection against LDMs.
