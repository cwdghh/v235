title: 'Critical windows: non-asymptotic theory for feature emergence in diffusion
  models'
openreview: a8ZpjLJuKk
abstract: We develop theory to understand an intriguing property of diffusion models
  for image generation that we term <em>critical windows</em>. Empirically, it has
  been observed that there are narrow time intervals in sampling during which particular
  features of the final image emerge, e.g. the image class or background color (Ho
  et al., 2020b; Meng et al., 2022; Choi et al., 2022; Raya & Ambrogioni, 2023; Georgiev
  et al., 2023; Sclocchi et al., 2024; Biroli et al., 2024). While this is advantageous
  for interpretability as it implies one can localize properties of the generation
  to a small segment of the trajectory, it seems at odds with the continuous nature
  of the diffusion. We propose a formal framework for studying these windows and show
  that for data coming from a mixture of strongly log-concave densities, these windows
  can be provably bounded in terms of certain measures of inter- and intra-group separation.
  We also instantiate these bounds for concrete examples like well-conditioned Gaussian
  mixtures. Finally, we use our bounds to give a rigorous interpretation of diffusion
  models as hierarchical samplers that progressively “decide” output features over
  a discrete sequence of times. We validate our bounds with experiments on synthetic
  data and show that critical windows may serve as a useful tool for diagnosing fairness
  and privacy violations in real-world diffusion models.
