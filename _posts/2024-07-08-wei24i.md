title: Extending Test-Time Augmentation with Metamorphic Relations for Combinatorial
  Problems
openreview: PNsdnl8blk
abstract: The application of machine learning methods to solve combinatorial problems
  has garnered considerable research interest. In this paper, we propose MAgg (<b>M</b>etamorphic
  <b>Agg</b>regation), a method to augment machine learning models for combinatorial
  problems at inference time using metamorphic relations. MAgg models metamorphic
  relations using directed graphs, which are then fed to a Graph Neural Network (GNN)
  model to improve the aggregation of predictions across transformed input instances.
  By incorporating metamorphic relations, MAgg essentially extends standard Test-Time
  Augmentation (TTA), eliminating the necessity of label-preserving transformations
  and expanding its applicability to a broader range of supervised learning tasks
  for combinatorial problems. We evaluate the proposed MAgg method on three mainstream
  machine learning tasks for combinatorial problems, namely Boolean Satisfiability
  Prediction (SAT), Decision Traveling Salesman Problem Satisfiability Prediction
  (Decision TSP), and Graph Edit Distance Estimation (GED). The evaluation result
  shows significant improvements over base models in all three tasks, corroborating
  the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed method.
