title: Unveiling the Potential of AI for Nanomaterial Morphology Prediction
openreview: 5nuW5iBAJS
abstract: Creation of nanomaterials with specific morphology remains a complex experimental
  process, even though there is a growing demand for these materials in various industry
  sectors. This study explores the potential of AI to predict the morphology of nanoparticles
  within the data availability constraints. For that, we first generated a new multi-modal
  dataset that is double the size of analogous studies. Then, we systematically evaluated
  performance of classical machine learning and large language models in prediction
  of nanomaterial shapes and sizes. Finally, we prototyped a text-to-image system,
  discussed the obtained empirical results, as well as the limitations and promises
  of existing approaches.
