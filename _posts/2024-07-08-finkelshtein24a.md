title: Cooperative Graph Neural Networks
openreview: ZQcqXCuoxD
abstract: 'Graph neural networks are popular architectures for graph machine learning,
  based on iterative computation of node representations of an input graph through
  a series of invariant transformations. A large class of graph neural networks follow
  a standard message-passing paradigm: at every layer, each node state is updated
  based on an aggregate of messages from its neighborhood. In this work, we propose
  a novel framework for training graph neural networks, where every node is viewed
  as a player that can choose to either listen, broadcast, listen and broadcast, or
  to isolate. The standard message propagation scheme can then be viewed as a special
  case of this framework where every node listens and broadcasts to all neighbors.
  Our approach offers a more flexible and dynamic message-passing paradigm, where
  each node can determine its own strategy based on their state, effectively exploring
  the graph topology while learning. We provide a theoretical analysis of the new
  message-passing scheme which is further supported by an extensive empirical analysis
  on a synthetic and real-world datasets.'
