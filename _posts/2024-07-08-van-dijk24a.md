title: 'Proactive DP: A Multiple Target Optimization Framework for DP-SGD'
openreview: 1nT6uc3HdY
abstract: We introduce a multiple target optimization framework for DP-SGD referred
  to as pro-active DP. In contrast to traditional DP accountants, which are used to
  track the expenditure of privacy budgets, the pro-active DP scheme allows one to
  <em>a-priori</em> select parameters of DP-SGD based on a fixed privacy budget (in
  terms of $\epsilon$ and $\delta$) in such a way to optimize the anticipated utility
  (test accuracy) the most. To achieve this objective, we first propose significant
  improvements to the moment account method, presenting a closed-form $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP
  guarantee that connects all parameters in the DP-SGD setup. Generally, DP-SGD is
  $(\epsilon\leq 1/2,\delta=1/N)$-DP if $\sigma=\sqrt{2(\epsilon +\ln(1/\delta))/\epsilon}$
  with $T$ at least $\approx 2k^2/\epsilon$ and $(2/e)^2k^2-1/2\geq \ln(N)$, where
  $T$ is the total number of rounds, and $K=kN$ is the total number of gradient computations
  where $k$ measures $K$ in number of epochs of size $N$ of the local data set. We
  prove that our expression is close to tight in that if $T$ is more than a constant
  factor $\approx 4$ smaller than the lower bound $\approx 2k^2/\epsilon$, then the
  $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP guarantee is violated. Our enhanced DP theory allows us to
  create a utility graph and DP calculator. These tools link privacy and utility objectives
  and search for optimal experiment setups, efficiently taking into account both accuracy
  and privacy objectives, as well as implementation goals. We furnish a comprehensive
  implementation flow of our proactive DP, with rigorous experiments to showcase the
  proof-of-concept.
