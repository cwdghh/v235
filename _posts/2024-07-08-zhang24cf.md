title: Efficient Denoising Diffusion via Probabilistic Masking
openreview: pktvuR7b5v
abstract: Diffusion models have exhibited remarkable advancements in generating high-quality
  data. However, a critical drawback is their computationally intensive inference
  process, which requires a large number of timesteps to generate a single sample.
  Existing methods address this challenge by decoupling the forward and reverse processes,
  and they rely on handcrafted rules for sampling acceleration, leading to the risk
  of discarding important steps. In this paper, we propose an Efficient Denoising
  Diffusion method via Probabilistic Masking (EDDPM) that can identify and skip the
  redundant steps during training. To determine whether a timestep should be skipped
  or not, we employ probabilistic reparameterization to continualize the binary determination
  mask. The mask distribution parameters are learned jointly with model weights. By
  incorporating a real-time sparse constraint, our method can effectively identify
  and eliminate unnecessary steps during the training iterations, thereby improving
  inference efficiency. Notably, as the model becomes fully trained, the random masks
  converge to a sparse and deterministic one, retaining only a small number of essential
  steps. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed EDDPM over
  the state-of-the-art sampling acceleration methods across various domains. EDDPM
  can generate high-quality samples with only 20% of the steps for time series imputation
  and achieve 4.89 FID with 5 steps for CIFAR-10. Moreover, when starting from a pretrained
  model, our method efficiently identifies the most informative timesteps within a
  single epoch, which demonstrates the potential of EDDPM to be a practical tool to
  explore large diffusion models with limited resources.
