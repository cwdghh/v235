  Traveling Salesman Problems'
openreview: cEJ9jNJuJP
abstract: 'Recent advancements in solving large-scale traveling salesman problems
  (TSP) utilize the heatmap-guided Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) paradigm, where
  machine learning (ML) models generate heatmaps, indicating the probability distribution
  of each edge being part of the optimal solution, to guide MCTS in solution finding.
  However, our theoretical and experimental analysis raises doubts about the effectiveness
  of ML-based heatmap generation. In support of this, we demonstrate that a simple
  baseline method can outperform complex ML approaches in heatmap generation. Furthermore,
  we question the practical value of the heatmap-guided MCTS paradigm. To substantiate
  this, our findings show its inferiority to the LKH-3 heuristic despite the paradigmâ€™s
  reliance on problem-specific, hand-crafted strategies. For the future, we suggest
  research directions focused on developing more theoretically sound heatmap generation
  methods and exploring autonomous, generalizable ML approaches for combinatorial
  problems. The code is available for review: https://github.com/xyfffff/rethink_mcts_for_tsp.'
