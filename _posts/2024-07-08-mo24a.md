title: 'TERD: A Unified Framework for Safeguarding Diffusion Models Against Backdoors'
openreview: lpHjmPvxW1
abstract: 'Diffusion models have achieved notable success in image generation, but
  they remain highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which compromise their integrity
  by producing specific undesirable outputs when presented with a pre-defined trigger.
  In this paper, we investigate how to protect diffusion models from this dangerous
  threat. Specifically, we propose <b>TERD</b>, a backdoor defense framework that
  builds unified modeling for current attacks, which enables us to derive an accessible
  reversed loss. A trigger reversion strategy is further employed: an initial approximation
  of the trigger through noise sampled from a prior distribution, followed by refinement
  through differential multi-step samplers. Additionally, with the reversed trigger,
  we propose backdoor detection from the noise space, introducing the first backdoor
  input detection approach for diffusion models and a novel model detection algorithm
  that calculates the KL divergence between reversed and benign distributions. Extensive
  evaluations demonstrate that TERD secures a 100% True Positive Rate (TPR) and True
  Negative Rate (TNR) across datasets of varying resolutions. TERD also demonstrates
  nice adaptability to other Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE)-based models.
