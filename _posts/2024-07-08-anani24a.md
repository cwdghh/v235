title: Adaptive Hierarchical Certification for Segmentation using Randomized Smoothing
openreview: iOEReiiTit
abstract: 'Certification for machine learning is proving that no adversarial sample
  can evade a model within a range under certain conditions, a necessity for safety-critical
  domains. Common certification methods for segmentation use a flat set of fine-grained
  classes, leading to high abstain rates due to model uncertainty across many classes.
  We propose a novel, more practical setting, which certifies pixels within a multi-level
  hierarchy, and adaptively relaxes the certification to a coarser level for unstable
  components classic methods would abstain from, effectively lowering the abstain
  rate whilst providing more certified semantically meaningful information. We mathematically
  formulate the problem setup, introduce an adaptive hierarchical certification algorithm
  and prove the correctness of its guarantees. Since certified accuracy does not take
  the loss of information into account for coarser classes, we introduce the Certified
  Information Gain ($\mathrm{CIG}$) metric, which is proportional to the class granularity
  level. Our extensive experiments on the datasets Cityscapes, PASCAL-Context, ACDC
  and COCO-Stuff demonstrate that our adaptive algorithm achieves a higher $\mathrm{CIG}$
  and lower abstain rate compared to the current state-of-the-art certification method.
