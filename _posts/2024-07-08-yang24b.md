title: 'Mind the Boundary: Coreset Selection via Reconstructing the Decision Boundary'
openreview: hWng0GXeE4
abstract: Existing paradigms of pushing the state of the art require exponentially
  more training data in many fields. Coreset selection seeks to mitigate this growing
  demand by identifying the most efficient subset of training data. In this paper,
  we delve into geometry-based coreset methods and preliminarily link the geometry
  of data distribution with modelsâ€™ generalization capability in theoretics. Leveraging
  these theoretical insights, we propose a novel coreset construction method by selecting
  training samples to reconstruct the decision boundary of a deep neural network learned
  on the full dataset. Extensive experiments across various popular benchmarks demonstrate
  the superiority of our method over multiple competitors. For the first time, our
  method achieves a 50% data pruning rate on the ImageNet-1K dataset while sacrificing
  less than 1% in accuracy. Additionally, we showcase and analyze the remarkable cross-architecture
  transferability of the coresets derived from our approach.
