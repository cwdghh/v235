title: "$\\mathttVITS$ : Variational Inference Thompson Sampling for contextual bandits"
openreview: a1GvTbadqA
abstract: In this paper, we introduce and analyze a variant of the Thompson sampling
  (TS) algorithm for contextual bandits. At each round, traditional TS requires samples
  from the current posterior distribution, which is usually intractable. To circumvent
  this issue, approximate inference techniques can be used and provide samples with
  distribution close to the posteriors. However, current approximate techniques yield
  to either poor estimation (Laplace approximation) or can be computationally expensive
  (MCMC methods, Ensemble sampling...). In this paper, we propose a new algorithm,
  Varational Inference TS $\mathtt{VITS}$, based on Gaussian Variational Inference.
  This scheme provides powerful posterior approximations which are easy to sample
  from, and is computationally efficient, making it an ideal choice for TS. In addition,
  we show that $\mathtt{VITS}$ achieves a sub-linear regret bound of the same order
  in the dimension and number of round as traditional TS for linear contextual bandit.
  Finally, we demonstrate experimentally the effectiveness of $\mathtt{VITS}$ on both
  synthetic and real world datasets
