title: Differentially Private Domain Adaptation with Theoretical Guarantees
openreview: kkqIEp2bRa
abstract: In many applications, the labeled data at the learnerâ€™s disposal is subject
  to privacy constraints and is relatively limited. To derive a more accurate predictor
  for the target domain, it is often beneficial to leverage publicly available labeled
  data from an alternative domain, somewhat close to the target domain. This is the
  modern problem of supervised domain adaptation from a public source to a private
  target domain. We present two $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially private adaptation
  algorithms for supervised adaptation, for which we make use of a general optimization
  problem, recently shown to benefit from favorable theoretical learning guarantees.
  Our first algorithm is designed for regression with linear predictors and shown
  to solve a convex optimization problem. Our second algorithm is a more general solution
  for loss functions that may be non-convex but Lipschitz and smooth. While our main
  objective is a theoretical analysis, we also report the results of several experiments.
  We first show that the non-private versions of our algorithms match state-of-the-art
  performance in supervised adaptation and that for larger values of the target sample
  size or $\epsilon$, the performance of our private algorithms remains close to that
  of their non-private counterparts.
