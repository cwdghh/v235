title: 'MOKD: Cross-domain Finetuning for Few-shot Classification via Maximizing Optimized
  Kernel Dependence'
openreview: fz9PaJNViP
abstract: 'In cross-domain few-shot classification, <em>nearest centroid classifier</em>
  (NCC) aims to learn representations to construct a metric space where few-shot classification
  can be performed by measuring the similarities between samples and the prototype
  of each class. An intuition behind NCC is that each sample is pulled closer to the
  class centroid it belongs to while pushed away from those of other classes. However,
  in this paper, we find that there exist high similarities between NCC-learned representations
  of two samples from different classes. In order to address this problem, we propose
  a bi-level optimization framework, <em>maximizing optimized kernel dependence</em>
  (MOKD) to learn a set of class-specific representations that match the cluster structures
  indicated by labeled data of the given task. Specifically, MOKD first optimizes
  the kernel adopted in <em>Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion</em> (HSIC) to
  obtain the optimized kernel HSIC (opt-HSIC) that can capture the dependence more
  precisely. Then, an optimization problem regarding the opt-HSIC is addressed to
  simultaneously maximize the dependence between representations and labels and minimize
  the dependence among all samples. Extensive experiments on Meta-Dataset demonstrate
  that MOKD can not only achieve better generalization performance on unseen domains
  in most cases but also learn better data representation clusters. The project repository
  of MOKD is available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/MOKD.'
