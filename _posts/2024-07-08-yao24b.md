title: 'Human vs. Generative AI in Content Creation Competition: Symbiosis or Conflict?'
openreview: dT6ZbSxh33
abstract: The advent of generative AI (GenAI) technology produces a transformative
  impact on the content creation landscape, offering alternative approaches to produce
  diverse, good-quality content across media, thereby reshaping online ecosystems
  but also raising concerns about market over-saturation and the potential marginalization
  of human creativity. Our work introduces a competition model generalized from the
  Tullock contest to analyze the tension between human creators and GenAI. Our theory
  and simulations suggest that despite challenges, a stable equilibrium between human
  and AI-generated content is possible. Our work contributes to understanding the
  competitive dynamics in the content creation industry, offering insights into the
  future interplay between human creativity and technological advancements in GenAI.
