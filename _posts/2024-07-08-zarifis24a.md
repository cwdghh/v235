title: Robustly Learning Single-Index Models via Alignment Sharpness
openreview: AZ1tWCa9j3
abstract: We study the problem of learning Single-Index Models under the $L_2^2$ loss
  in the agnostic model. We give an efficient learning algorithm, achieving a constant
  factor approximation to the optimal loss, that succeeds under a range of distributions
  (including log-concave distributions) and a broad class of monotone and Lipschitz
  link functions. This is the first efficient constant factor approximate agnostic
  learner, even for Gaussian data and for any nontrivial class of link functions.
  Prior work for the case of unknown link function either works in the realizable
  setting or does not attain constant factor approximation. The main technical ingredient
  enabling our algorithm and analysis is a novel notion of a local error bound in
  optimization that we term <em>alignment sharpness</em> and that may be of broader
  interest.
