title: Bottleneck-Minimal Indexing for Generative Document Retrieval
openreview: MFPYCvWsNR
abstract: We apply an information-theoretic perspective to reconsider generative document
  retrieval (GDR), in which a document $x \in \mathcal{X}$ is indexed by $t \in \mathcal{T}$,
  and a neural autoregressive model is trained to map queries $\mathcal{Q}$ to $\mathcal{T}$.
  GDR can be considered to involve information transmission from documents $\mathcal{X}$
  to queries $\mathcal{Q}$, with the requirement to transmit more bits via the indexes
  $\mathcal{T}$. By applying Shannonâ€™s rate-distortion theory, the optimality of indexing
  can be analyzed in terms of the mutual information, and the design of the indexes
  $\mathcal{T}$ can then be regarded as a <em>bottleneck</em> in GDR. After reformulating
  GDR from this perspective, we empirically quantify the bottleneck underlying GDR.
  Finally, using the NQ320K and MARCO datasets, we evaluate our proposed bottleneck-minimal
  indexing method in comparison with various previous indexing methods, and we show
  that it outperforms those methods.
