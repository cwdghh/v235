title: Byzantine Resilient and Fast Federated Few-Shot Learning
openreview: q5q59s2WJy
abstract: This work introduces a Byzantine resilient solution for learning low-dimensional
  linear representation. Our main contribution is the development of a provably Byzantine-resilient
  AltGDmin algorithm for solving this problem in a federated setting. We argue that
  our solution is sample-efficient, fast, and communicationefficient. In solving this
  problem, we also introduce a novel secure solution to the federated subspace learning
  meta-problem that occurs in many different applications.
