title: Provably Scalable Black-Box Variational Inference with Structured Variational
  Families
openreview: 0miAQ1qHiw
abstract: 'Variational families with full-rank covariance approximations are known
  not to work well in black-box variational inference (BBVI), both empirically and
  theoretically. In fact, recent computational complexity results for BBVI have established
  that full-rank variational families scale poorly with the dimensionality of the
  problem compared to <em>e.g.</em> mean-field families. This is particularly critical
  to hierarchical Bayesian models with local variables; their dimensionality increases
  with the size of the datasets. Consequently, one gets an iteration complexity with
  an explicit $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ dependence on the dataset size $N$. In this paper,
  we explore a theoretical middle ground <em>between</em> mean-field variational families
  and full-rank families: <em>structured</em> variational families. We rigorously
  prove that certain scale matrix structures can achieve a better iteration complexity
  of $\mathcal{O}\left(N\right)$, implying better scaling with respect to $N$. We
  empirically verify our theoretical results on large-scale hierarchical models.'
