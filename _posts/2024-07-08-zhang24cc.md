title: Lightweight Image Super-Resolution via Flexible Meta Pruning
openreview: QFMcXz6e4Y
abstract: Lightweight image super-resolution (SR) methods have obtained promising
  results with moderate model complexity. These approaches primarily focus on a lightweight
  architecture design, but neglect to further reduce network redundancy. While some
  model compression techniques try to achieve more lightweight SR models with neural
  architecture search, knowledge distillation, or channel pruning, they typically
  require considerable extra computational resources or neglect to prune weights.
  To address these issues, we propose a flexible meta pruning (FMP) for lightweight
  image SR, where the network channels and weights are pruned simultaneously. Specifically,
  we control the network sparsity via channel vectors and weight indicators. We feed
  them into a hypernetwork, whose parameters act as meta-data for the parameters of
  the SR backbone. Consequently, for each network layer, we conduct structured pruning
  with channel vectors, which control the output and input channels. Besides, we conduct
  unstructured pruning with weight indicators to influence the sparsity of kernel
  weights, resulting in flexible pruning. During pruning, the sparsity of both channel
  vectors and weight indicators are regularized. We optimize the channel vectors and
  weight indicators with proximal gradient and SGD. We conduct extensive experiments
  to investigate critical factors in the flexible channel and weight pruning for image
  SR, demonstrating the superiority of our FMP when applied to baseline image SR architectures.
