title: Constrained Ensemble Exploration for Unsupervised Skill Discovery
openreview: AOJCCFTlfJ
abstract: Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a promising paradigm for
  learning useful behaviors via reward-free per-training. Existing methods for unsupervised
  RL mainly conduct empowerment-driven skill discovery or entropy-based exploration.
  However, empowerment often leads to static skills, and pure exploration only maximizes
  the state coverage rather than learning useful behaviors. In this paper, we propose
  a novel unsupervised RL framework via an ensemble of skills, where each skill performs
  partition exploration based on the state prototypes. Thus, each skill can explore
  the clustered area locally, and the ensemble skills maximize the overall state coverage.
  We adopt state-distribution constraints for the skill occupancy and the desired
  cluster for learning distinguishable skills. Theoretical analysis is provided for
  the state entropy and the resulting skill distributions. Based on extensive experiments
  on several challenging tasks, we find our method learns well-explored ensemble skills
  and achieves superior performance in various downstream tasks compared to previous
  methods.
