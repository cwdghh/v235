title: Full-Atom Peptide Design based on Multi-modal Flow Matching
openreview: 5tPB5VXo87
abstract: Peptides, short chains of amino acid residues, play a vital role in numerous
  biological processes by interacting with other target molecules, offering substantial
  potential in drug discovery. In this work, we present <em>PepFlow</em>, the first
  multi-modal deep generative model grounded in the flow-matching framework for the
  design of full-atom peptides that target specific protein receptors. Drawing inspiration
  from the crucial roles of residue backbone orientations and side-chain dynamics
  in protein-peptide interactions, we characterize the peptide structure using rigid
  backbone frames within the $\mathrm{SE}(3)$ manifold and side-chain angles on high-dimensional
  tori. Furthermore, we represent discrete residue types in the peptide sequence as
  categorical distributions on the probability simplex. By learning the joint distributions
  of each modality using derived flows and vector fields on corresponding manifolds,
  our method excels in the fine-grained design of full-atom peptides. Harnessing the
  multi-modal paradigm, our approach adeptly tackles various tasks such as fix-backbone
  sequence design and side-chain packing through partial sampling. Through meticulously
  crafted experiments, we demonstrate that <em>PepFlow</em> exhibits superior performance
  in comprehensive benchmarks, highlighting its significant potential in computational
  peptide design and analysis.
