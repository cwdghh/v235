title: 'UGrid: An Efficient-And-Rigorous Neural Multigrid Solver for Linear PDEs'
openreview: vFATIZXlCm
abstract: Numerical solvers of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are of fundamental
  significance to science and engineering. To date, the historical reliance on legacy
  techniques has circumscribed possible integration of big data knowledge and exhibits
  sub-optimal efficiency for certain PDE formulations, while data-driven neural methods
  typically lack mathematical guarantee of convergence and correctness. This paper
  articulates a mathematically rigorous neural solver for linear PDEs. The proposed
  UGrid solver, built upon the principled integration of U-Net and MultiGrid, manifests
  a mathematically rigorous proof of both convergence and correctness, and showcases
  high numerical accuracy, as well as strong generalization power to various input
  geometry/values and multiple PDE formulations. In addition, we devise a new residual
  loss metric, which enables unsupervised training and affords more stability and
  a larger solution space over the legacy losses.
