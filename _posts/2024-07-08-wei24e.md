title: 'Task Groupings Regularization: Data-Free Meta-Learning with Heterogeneous
  Pre-trained Models'
openreview: UcOze9EXEc
abstract: Data-Free Meta-Learning (DFML) aims to derive knowledge from a collection
  of pre-trained models without accessing their original data, enabling the rapid
  adaptation to new unseen tasks. Current methods often overlook the heterogeneity
  among pre-trained models, which leads to performance degradation due to task conflicts.
  In this paper, we empirically and theoretically identify and analyze the model heterogeneity
  in DFML. We find that model heterogeneity introduces a heterogeneity-homogeneity
  trade-off, where homogeneous models reduce task conflicts but also increase the
  overfitting risk. Balancing this trade-off is crucial for learning shared representations
  across tasks. Based on our findings, we propose Task Groupings Regularization, a
  novel approach that benefits from model heterogeneity by grouping and aligning conflicting
  tasks. Specifically, we embed pre-trained models into a task space to compute dissimilarity,
  and group heterogeneous models together based on this measure. Then, we introduce
  implicit gradient regularization within each group to mitigate potential conflicts.
  By encouraging a gradient direction suitable for all tasks, the meta-model captures
  shared representations that generalize across tasks. Comprehensive experiments showcase
  the superiority of our approach in multiple benchmarks, effectively tackling the
  model heterogeneity in challenging multi-domain and multi-architecture scenarios.
