title: 'Using Left and Right Brains Together: Towards Vision and Language Planning'
openreview: o1gS6MNAw8
abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Multi-modality Models (LMMs) have
  demonstrated remarkable decision masking capabilities on a variety of tasks. However,
  they inherently operate planning within the language space, lacking the vision and
  spatial imagination ability. In contrast, humans utilize both left and right hemispheres
  of the brain for language and visual planning during the thinking process. Therefore,
  we introduce a novel vision-language planning framework in this work to perform
  concurrent visual and language planning for tasks with inputs of any form. Our framework
  incorporates visual planning to capture intricate environmental details, while language
  planning enhances the logical coherence of the overall system. We evaluate the effectiveness
  of our framework across vision-language tasks, vision-only tasks, and language-only
  tasks. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our approach, indicating
  that the integration of visual and language planning yields better contextually
  aware task execution.
