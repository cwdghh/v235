title: 'Binning as a Pretext Task: Improving Self-Supervised Learning in Tabular Domains'
openreview: ErkzxOlOLy
abstract: 'The ability of deep networks to learn superior representations hinges on
  leveraging the proper inductive biases, considering the inherent properties of datasets.
  In tabular domains, it is critical to effectively handle heterogeneous features
  (both categorical and numerical) in a unified manner and to grasp irregular functions
  like piecewise constant functions. To address the challenges in the self-supervised
  learning framework, we propose a novel pretext task based on the classical binning
  method. The idea is straightforward: reconstructing the bin indices (either orders
  or classes) rather than the original values. This pretext task provides the encoder
  with an inductive bias to capture the irregular dependencies, mapping from continuous
  inputs to discretized bins, and mitigates the feature heterogeneity by setting all
  features to have category-type targets. Our empirical investigations ascertain several
  advantages of binning: capturing the irregular function, compatibility with encoder
  architecture and additional modifications, standardizing all features into equal
  sets, grouping similar values within a feature, and providing ordering information.
  Comprehensive evaluations across diverse tabular datasets corroborate that our method
  consistently improves tabular representation learning performance for a wide range
  of downstream tasks. The codes are available in https://github.com/kyungeun-lee/tabularbinning.'
