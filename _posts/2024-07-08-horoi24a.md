title: 'Harmony in Diversity: Merging Neural Networks with Canonical Correlation Analysis'
openreview: hLuNVjRnY3
abstract: Combining the predictions of multiple trained models through ensembling
  is generally a good way to improve accuracy by leveraging the different learned
  features of the models, however it comes with high computational and storage costs.
  Model fusion, the act of merging multiple models into one by combining their parameters
  reduces these costs but doesn’t work as well in practice. Indeed, neural network
  loss landscapes are high-dimensional and non-convex and the minima found through
  learning are typically separated by high loss barriers. Numerous recent works have
  been focused on finding permutations matching one network features to the features
  of a second one, lowering the loss barrier on the linear path between them in parameter
  space. However, permutations are restrictive since they assume a one-to-one mapping
  between the different models’ neurons exists. We propose a new model merging algorithm,
  CCA Merge, which is based on Canonical Correlation Analysis and aims to maximize
  the correlations between linear combinations of the model features. We show that
  our alignment method leads to better performances than past methods when averaging
  models trained on the same, or differing data splits. We also extend this analysis
  into the harder setting where more than 2 models are merged, and we find that CCA
  Merge works significantly better than past methods. Our code is publicly available
