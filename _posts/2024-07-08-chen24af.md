title: 'TimeMIL: Advancing Multivariate Time Series Classification via a Time-aware
  Multiple Instance Learning'
openreview: AxmefV2NEf
abstract: Deep neural networks, including transformers and convolutional neural networks
  (CNNs), have significantly improved multivariate time series classification (MTSC).
  However, these methods often rely on supervised learning, which does not fully account
  for the sparsity and locality of patterns in time series data (e.g., quantification
  of diseases-related anomalous points in ECG and abnormal detection in signal). To
  address this challenge, we formally discuss and reformulate MTSC as a weakly supervised
  problem, introducing a novel multiple-instance learning (MIL) framework for better
  localization of patterns of interest and modeling time dependencies within time
  series. Our novel approach, TimeMIL, formulates the temporal correlation and ordering
  within a time-aware MIL pooling, leveraging a tokenized transformer with a specialized
  learnable wavelet positional token. The proposed method surpassed 26 recent state-of-the-art
  MTSC methods, underscoring the effectiveness of the weakly supervised TimeMIL in
  MTSC. The code is available https://github.com/xiwenc1/TimeMIL.
