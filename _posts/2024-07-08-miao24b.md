title: Locality-Sensitive Hashing-Based Efficient Point Transformer with Applications
  in High-Energy Physics
openreview: vJx6fld6l0
abstract: This study introduces a novel transformer model optimized for large-scale
  point cloud processing in scientific domains such as high-energy physics (HEP) and
  astrophysics. Addressing the limitations of graph neural networks and standard transformers,
  our model integrates local inductive bias and achieves near-linear complexity with
  hardware-friendly regular operations. One contribution of this work is the quantitative
  analysis of the error-complexity tradeoff of various sparsification techniques for
  building efficient transformers. Our findings highlight the superiority of using
  locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), especially OR & AND-construction LSH, in kernel
  approximation for large-scale point cloud data with local inductive bias. Based
  on this finding, we propose LSH-based Efficient Point Transformer (<b>HEPT</b>),
  which combines E$^2$LSH with OR & AND constructions and is built upon regular computations.
  HEPT demonstrates remarkable performance on two critical yet time-consuming HEP
  tasks, significantly outperforming existing GNNs and transformers in accuracy and
  computational speed, marking a significant advancement in geometric deep learning
  and large-scale scientific data processing. Our code is available at https://github.com/Graph-COM/HEPT.
