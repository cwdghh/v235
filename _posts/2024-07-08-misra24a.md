title: Provable Interactive Learning with Hindsight Instruction Feedback
openreview: CgO2cuWWLV
abstract: We study interactive learning in a setting where the agent has to generate
  a response (e.g., an action or trajectory) given a context and an instruction. In
  contrast, to typical approaches that train the system using reward or expert supervision
  on response, we study <em>learning with hindsight labeling</em> where a teacher
  provides an instruction that is most suitable for the agent’s generated response.
  This hindsight labeling of instruction is often easier to provide than providing
  expert supervision of the optimal response which may require expert knowledge or
  can be impractical to elicit. We initiate the theoretical analysis of <em>interactive
  learning with hindsight labeling</em>. We first provide a lower bound showing that
  in general, the regret of any algorithm must scale with the size of the agent’s
  response space. Next, we study a specialized setting where the underlying instruction-response
  distribution can be decomposed as a low-rank matrix. We introduce an algorithm called
  LORIL for this setting and show that it is a no-regret algorithm with the regret
  scaling with $\sqrt{T}$ and depends on the <em>intrinsic rank</em> but does not
  depend on the agent’s response space. We provide experiments showing the performance
  of LORIL in practice for 2 domains.
