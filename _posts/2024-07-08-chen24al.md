title: 'Performative Prediction with Bandit Feedback: Learning through Reparameterization'
openreview: yHs3jIPgaF
abstract: 'Performative prediction, as introduced by Perdomo et al., is a framework
  for studying social prediction in which the data distribution itself changes in
  response to the deployment of a model. Existing work in this field usually hinges
  on three assumptions that are easily violated in practice: that the performative
  risk is convex over the deployed model, that the mapping from the model to the data
  distribution is known to the model designer in advance, and the first-order information
  of the performative risk is available. In this paper, we initiate the study of performative
  prediction problems that do not require these assumptions. Specifically, we develop
  a parameterization framework that parametrizes the performative prediction objective
  as a function of the induced data distribution. We also develop a two-level zeroth-order
  optimization procedure, where the first level performs iterative optimization on
  the distribution parameter space, and the second level learns the model that induced
  a particular target distribution parameter at each iteration. Under mild conditions,
  this reparameterization allows us to transform the non-convex objective into a convex
  one and achieve provable regret guarantees. In particular, we provide a regret bound
  that is sublinear in the total number of performative samples taken and is only
  polynomial in the dimension of the model parameter.'
