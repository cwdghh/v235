title: Recurrent Early Exits for Federated Learning with Heterogeneous Clients
openreview: w4B42sxNq3
abstract: Federated learning (FL) has enabled distributed learning of a model across
  multiple clients in a privacy-preserving manner. One of the main challenges of FL
  is to accommodate clients with varying hardware capacities; clients have differing
  compute and memory requirements. To tackle this challenge, recent state-of-the-art
  approaches leverage the use of early exits. Nonetheless, these approaches fall short
  of mitigating the challenges of joint learning multiple exit classifiers, often
  relying on hand-picked heuristic solutions for knowledge distillation among classifiers
  and/or utilizing additional layers for weaker classifiers. In this work, instead
  of utilizing multiple classifiers, we propose a recurrent early exit approach named
  ReeFL that fuses features from different sub-models into a single shared classifier.
  Specifically, we use a transformer-based early-exit module shared among sub-models
  to i) better exploit multi-layer feature representations for task-specific prediction
  and ii) modulate the feature representation of the backbone model for subsequent
  predictions. We additionally present a per-client self-distillation approach where
  the best sub-model is automatically selected as the teacher of the other sub-models
  at each client. Our experiments on standard image and speech classification benchmarks
  across various emerging federated fine-tuning baselines demonstrate ReeFL effectiveness
  over previous works.
