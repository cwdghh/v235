title: Eluder-based Regret for Stochastic Contextual MDPs
openreview: 47jMS97wJX
abstract: We present the E-UC$^3$RL algorithm for regret minimization in Stochastic
  Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs). The algorithm operates under the minimal
  assumptions of realizable function class and access to <em>offline</em> least squares
  and log loss regression oracles. Our algorithm is efficient (assuming efficient
  offline regression oracles) and enjoys a regret guarantee of $ \widetilde{O}(H^3
  \sqrt{T |S| |A|d_{\mathrm{E}}(\mathcal{P}) \log (|\mathcal{F}| |\mathcal{P}|/ \delta)
  )}) $ , with $T$ being the number of episodes, $S$ the state space, $A$ the action
  space, $H$ the horizon, $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{F}$ are finite function classes
  used to approximate the context-dependent dynamics and rewards, respectively, and
  $d_{\mathrm{E}}(\mathcal{P})$ is the Eluder dimension of $\mathcal{P}$ w.r.t the
  Hellinger distance. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first efficient
  and rate-optimal regret minimization algorithm for CMDPs that operates under the
  general offline function approximation setting. In addition, we extend the Eluder
  dimension to general bounded metrics which may be of independent interest.
