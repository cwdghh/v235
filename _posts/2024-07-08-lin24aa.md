title: 'Lie Neurons: Adjoint-Equivariant Neural Networks for Semisimple Lie Algebras'
openreview: 1bJLl4fY6i
abstract: This paper proposes an equivariant neural network that takes data in any
  finite-dimensional semi-simple Lie algebra as input. The corresponding group acts
  on the Lie algebra as adjoint operations, making our proposed network adjoint-equivariant.
  Our framework generalizes the Vector Neurons, a simple $\mathrm{SO}(3)$-equivariant
  network, from 3-D Euclidean space to Lie algebra spaces, building upon the invariance
  property of the Killing form. Furthermore, we propose novel Lie bracket layers and
  geometric channel mixing layers that extend the modeling capacity. Experiments are
  conducted for the $\mathfrak{so}(3)$, $\mathfrak{sl}(3)$, and $\mathfrak{sp}(4)$
  Lie algebras on various tasks, including fitting equivariant and invariant functions,
  learning system dynamics, point cloud registration, and homography-based shape classification.
  Our proposed equivariant network shows wide applicability and competitive performance
  in various domains.
