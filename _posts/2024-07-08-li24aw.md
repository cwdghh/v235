title: Individual Contributions as Intrinsic Exploration Scaffolds for Multi-agent
  Reinforcement Learning
openreview: zCmMkWK4Ly
abstract: In multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), effective exploration is critical,
  especially in sparse reward environments. Although introducing global intrinsic
  rewards can foster exploration in such settings, it often complicates credit assignment
  among agents. To address this difficulty, we propose Individual Contributions as
  intrinsic Exploration Scaffolds (ICES), a novel approach to motivate exploration
  by assessing each agentâ€™s contribution from a global view. In particular, ICES constructs
  exploration scaffolds with Bayesian surprise, leveraging global transition information
  during centralized training. These scaffolds, used only in training, help to guide
  individual agents towards actions that significantly impact the global latent state
  transitions. Additionally, ICES separates exploration policies from exploitation
  policies, enabling the former to utilize privileged global information during training.
  Extensive experiments on cooperative benchmark tasks with sparse rewards, including
  Google Research Football (GRF) and StarCraft Multi-agent Challenge (SMAC), demonstrate
  that ICES exhibits superior exploration capabilities compared with baselines. The
  code is publicly available at https://github.com/LXXXXR/ICES.
