title: Auto-Linear Phenomenon in Subsurface Imaging
openreview: 3ZM8MXGFRA
abstract: 'Subsurface imaging involves solving full waveform inversion (FWI) to predict
  geophysical properties from measurements. This problem can be reframed as an image-to-image
  translation, with the usual approach being to train an encoder-decoder network using
  paired data from two domains: geophysical property and measurement. A recent seminal
  work (InvLINT) demonstrates there is only a linear mapping between the latent spaces
  of the two domains, and the decoder requires paired data for training. This paper
  extends this direction by demonstrating that only linear mapping necessitates paired
  data, while both the encoder and decoder can be learned from their respective domains
  through self-supervised learning. This unveils an intriguing phenomenon (named Auto-Linear)
  where the self-learned features of two separate domains are automatically linearly
  correlated. Compared with existing methods, our Auto-Linear has four advantages:
  (a) solving both forward and inverse modeling simultaneously, (b) reducing model
  size, (c) enhanced performance, especially when the paired data is limited, and
  (d) strong generalization ability of the trained encoder and decoder.'
