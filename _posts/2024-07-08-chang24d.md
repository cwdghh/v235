title: 'MagicPose: Realistic Human Poses and Facial Expressions Retargeting with Identity-aware
  Diffusion'
openreview: jVXJdGQ4eD
abstract: In this work, we propose MagicPose, a diffusion-based model for 2D human
  pose and facial expression retargeting. Specifically, given a reference image, we
  aim to generate a personâ€™s new images by controlling the poses and facial expressions
  while keeping the identity unchanged. To this end, we propose a two-stage training
  strategy to disentangle human motions and appearance (e.g., facial expressions,
  skin tone, and dressing), consisting of (1) the pre-training of an appearance-control
  block and (2) learning appearance-disentangled pose control. Our novel design enables
  robust appearance control over generated human images, including body, facial attributes,
  and even background. By leveraging the prior knowledge of image diffusion models,
  MagicPose generalizes well to unseen human identities and complex poses without
  the need for additional fine-tuning. Moreover, the proposed model is easy to use
  and can be considered as a plug-in module/extension to Stable Diffusion. The project
  website is here. The code is available here.
