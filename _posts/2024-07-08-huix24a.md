title: Theoretical Guarantees for Variational Inference with Fixed-Variance Mixture
  of Gaussians
openreview: hnqlgwcRxb
abstract: Variational inference (VI) is a popular approach in Bayesian inference,
  that looks for the best approximation of the posterior distribution within a parametric
  family, minimizing a loss that is (typically) the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL)
  divergence. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical properties of VI have
  only recently received attention, and is restricted to the Gaussian case. This research
  paper aims to contribute to the theoretical study of VI in the non-Gaussian case
  by investigating the setting of Mixture of Gaussians with fixed covariance. In this
  view, VI over this specific family can be casted as the minimization of a Mollified
  relative entropy, i.e. the KL between the convolution (with respect to a Gaussian
  kernel) of an atomic measure supported on Diracs, where the support of the atomic
  measure correspond to the localization of the Gaussian components, and the target
  distribution. Hence, solving variational inference is equivalent to optimizing the
  positions of the Diracs (the particles), which can be done through gradient descent
  and takes the form of an interacting particle system. We study two sources of error
  in variational inference in this context. The first is an optimization result that
  is a descent lemma establishing that the algorithm decreases the objective at each
  iteration. The second is an approximation error that upper bounds the mollified
  relative entropy between an optimal finite mixture and the target distribution.
