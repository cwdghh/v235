title: 'Differentially Private Synthetic Data via Foundation Model APIs 2: Text'
openreview: LWD7upg1ob
abstract: Text data has become extremely valuable due to the emergence of machine
  learning algorithms that learn from it. A lot of high-quality text data generated
  in the real world is private and therefore cannot be shared or used freely due to
  privacy concerns. Generating synthetic replicas of private text data with a formal
  privacy guarantee, i.e., differential privacy (DP), offers a promising and scalable
  solution. However, existing methods necessitate DP finetuning of large language
  models (LLMs) on private data to generate DP synthetic data. This approach is not
  viable for proprietary LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5) and also demands considerable computational
  resources for open-source LLMs. Lin et al. (2024) recently introduced the Private
  Evolution (PE) algorithm to generate DP synthetic images with only API access to
  diffusion models. In this work, we propose an augmented PE algorithm, named Aug-PE,
  that applies to the complex setting of text. We use API access to an LLM and generate
  DP synthetic text without any model training. We conduct comprehensive experiments
  on three benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate that Aug-PE produces DP synthetic
  text that yields competitive utility with the SOTA DP finetuning baselines. This
  underscores the feasibility of relying solely on API access of LLMs to produce high-quality
  DP synthetic texts, thereby facilitating more accessible routes to privacy-preserving
  LLM applications.
