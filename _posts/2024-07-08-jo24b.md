title: Graph Generation with Diffusion Mixture
openreview: cZTFxktg23
abstract: Generation of graphs is a major challenge for real-world tasks that require
  understanding the complex nature of their non-Euclidean structures. Although diffusion
  models have achieved notable success in graph generation recently, they are ill-suited
  for modeling the topological properties of graphs since learning to denoise the
  noisy samples does not explicitly learn the graph structures to be generated. To
  tackle this limitation, we propose a generative framework that models the topology
  of graphs by explicitly learning the final graph structures of the diffusion process.
  Specifically, we design the generative process as a mixture of endpoint-conditioned
  diffusion processes which is driven toward the predicted graph that results in rapid
  convergence. We further introduce a simple parameterization of the mixture process
  and develop an objective for learning the final graph structure, which enables maximum
  likelihood training. Through extensive experimental validation on general graph
  and 2D/3D molecule generation tasks, we show that our method outperforms previous
  generative models, generating graphs with correct topology with both continuous
  (e.g. 3D coordinates) and discrete (e.g. atom types) features. Our code is available
  at https://github.com/harryjo97/GruM.
