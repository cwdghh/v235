title: 'COALA: A Practical and Vision-Centric Federated Learning Platform'
openreview: ATRnM8PyQX
abstract: We present COALA, a vision-centric Federated Learning (FL) platform, and
  a suite of benchmarks for practical FL scenarios, which we categorize as task, data,
  and model levels. At the task level, COALA extends support from simple classification
  to 15 computer vision tasks, including object detection, segmentation, pose estimation,
  and more. It also facilitates federated multiple-task learning, allowing clients
  to train on multiple tasks simultaneously. At the data level, COALA goes beyond
  supervised FL to benchmark both semi-supervised FL and unsupervised FL. It also
  benchmarks feature distribution shifts other than commonly considered label distribution
  shifts. In addition to dealing with static data, it supports federated continual
  learning for continuously changing data in real-world scenarios. At the model level,
  COALA benchmarks FL with split models and different models in different clients.
  COALA platform offers three degrees of customization for these practical FL scenarios,
  including configuration customization, components customization, and workflow customization.
  We conduct systematic benchmarking experiments for the practical FL scenarios and
  highlight potential opportunities for further advancements in FL.
