title: 'BRAIn: Bayesian Reward-conditioned Amortized Inference for natural language
  generation from feedback'
openreview: nxzXTLByXO
abstract: Distribution matching methods for language model alignment such as Generation
  with Distributional Control (GDC) and Distributional Policy Gradient (DPG) have
  not received the same level of attention in reinforcement learning from human feedback
  (RLHF) as contrastive methods such as Sequence Likelihood Calibration (SLiC), Direct
  Preference Optimization (DPO) and its variants. We identify high variance of the
  gradient estimate as the primary reason for the lack of success of these methods
  and propose a self-normalized baseline to reduce the variance. We further generalize
  the target distribution in DPG, GDC and DPO by using Bayes’ rule to define the reward-conditioned
  posterior. The resulting approach, referred to as BRAIn - Bayesian Reward-conditioned
  Amortized Inference acts as a bridge between distribution matching methods and DPO
  and significantly outperforms prior art in summarization and Antropic HH tasks.
