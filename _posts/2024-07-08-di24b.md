title: 'Double Variance Reduction: A Smoothing Trick for Composite Optimization Problems
  without First-Order Gradient'
openreview: e1jPdRJeo7
abstract: Variance reduction techniques are designed to decrease the sampling variance,
  thereby accelerating convergence rates of first-order (FO) and zeroth-order (ZO)
  optimization methods. However, in composite optimization problems, ZO methods encounter
  an additional variance called the coordinate-wise variance, which stems from the
  random gradient estimation. To reduce this variance, prior works require estimating
  all partial derivatives, essentially approximating FO information. This approach
  demands $\mathcal{O}(d)$ function evaluations ($d$ is the dimension size), which
  incurs substantial computational costs and is prohibitive in high-dimensional scenarios.
  This paper proposes the Zeroth-order Proximal Double Variance Reduction ($\texttt{ZPDVR}$)
  method, which utilizes the averaging trick to reduce both sampling and coordinate-wise
  variances. Compared to prior methods, $\texttt{ZPDVR}$ relies solely on random gradient
  estimates, calls the stochastic zeroth-order oracle (SZO) in expectation $\mathcal{O}(1)$
  times per iteration, and achieves the optimal $\mathcal{O}(d(n + \kappa)\log (\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$
  SZO query complexity in the strongly convex and smooth setting, where $\kappa$ represents
  the condition number and $\epsilon$ is the desired accuracy. Empirical results validate
  $\texttt{ZPDVR}$â€™s linear convergence and demonstrate its superior performance over
  other related methods.
