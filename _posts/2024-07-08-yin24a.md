title: 'StableMask: Refining Causal Masking in Decoder-only Transformer'
openreview: GFfWzAReAc
abstract: 'The decoder-only Transformer architecture with causal masking and relative
  position encoding (RPE) has become the de facto choice in language modeling. Despite
  its exceptional performance across various tasks, we have identified two limitations:
  First, it prevents all attended tokens from having zero weights during the softmax
  stage, even if the current embedding has sufficient self-contained information.
  This compels the model to assign disproportional excessive attention to specific
  tokens. Second, RPE-based Transformers are not universal approximators due to their
  limited capacity at encoding absolute positional information, which limits their
  application in position-critical tasks. In this work, we propose StableMask: a parameter-free
  method to address both limitations by refining the causal mask. It introduces pseudo-attention
  values to balance attention distributions and encodes absolute positional information
  via a progressively decreasing mask ratio. StableMaskâ€™s effectiveness is validated
  both theoretically and empirically, showing significant enhancements in language
  models with parameter sizes ranging from 71M to 1.4B across diverse datasets and
  encoding methods. We further show that it supports integration with existing optimization
  techniques, making it easily usable in practical applications.'
