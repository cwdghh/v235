title: On the Effectiveness of Supervision in Asymmetric Non-Contrastive Learning
openreview: iC8l9DI1ZX
abstract: 'Supervised contrastive representation learning has been shown to be effective
  in various transfer learning scenarios. However, while asymmetric non-contrastive
  learning (ANCL) often outperforms its contrastive learning counterpart in self-supervised
  representation learning, the extension of ANCL to supervised scenarios is less explored.
  To bridge the gap, we study ANCL for supervised representation learning, coined
  SupSiam and SupBYOL, leveraging labels in ANCL to achieve better representations.
  The proposed supervised ANCL framework improves representation learning while avoiding
  collapse. Our analysis reveals that providing supervision to ANCL reduces intra-class
  variance, and the contribution of supervision should be adjusted to achieve the
  best performance. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of supervised ANCL across
  various datasets and tasks. The code is available at: https://github.com/JH-Oh-23/Sup-ANCL.'
