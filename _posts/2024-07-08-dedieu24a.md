title: Learning Cognitive Maps from Transformer Representations for Efficient Planning
  in Partially Observed Environments
openreview: JUa5XNXuoT
abstract: Despite their stellar performance on a wide range of tasks, including in-context
  tasks only revealed during inference, vanilla transformers and variants trained
  for next-token predictions (a) do not learn an explicit world model of their environment
  which can be flexibly queried and (b) cannot be used for planning or navigation.
  In this paper, we consider partially observed environments (POEs), where an agent
  receives perceptually aliased observations as it navigates, which makes path planning
  hard. We introduce a transformer with (multiple) discrete bottleneck(s), TDB, whose
  latent codes learn a compressed representation of the history of observations and
  actions. After training a TDB to predict the future observation(s) given the history,
  we extract interpretable cognitive maps of the environment from its active bottleneck(s)
  indices. These maps are then paired with an external solver to solve (constrained)
  path planning problems. First, we show that a TDB trained on POEs (a) retains the
  near-perfect predictive performance of a vanilla transformer or an LSTM while (b)
  solving shortest path problems exponentially faster. Second, a TDB extracts interpretable
  representations from text datasets, while reaching higher in-context accuracy than
  vanilla sequence models. Finally, in new POEs, a TDB (a) reaches near-perfect in-context
  accuracy, (b) learns accurate in-context cognitive maps (c) solves in-context path
  planning problems.
