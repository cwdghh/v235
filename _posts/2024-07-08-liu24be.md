title: Entropy-Reinforced Planning with Large Language Models for Drug Discovery
openreview: F3Ds71Xgo1
abstract: 'The objective of drug discovery is to identify chemical compounds that
  possess specific pharmaceutical properties toward a binding target. Existing large
  language models (LLMS) can achieve high token matching scores in terms of likelihood
  for molecule generation. However, relying solely on LLM decoding often results in
  the generation of molecules that are either invalid due to a single misused token,
  or suboptimal due to unbalanced exploration and exploitation as a consequence of
  the LLMâ€™s prior experience. Here we propose ERP, Entropy-Reinforced Planning for
  Transformer Decoding, which employs an entropy-reinforced planning algorithm to
  enhance the Transformer decoding process and strike a balance between exploitation
  and exploration. ERP aims to achieve improvements in multiple properties compared
  to direct sampling from the Transformer. We evaluated ERP on the SARS-CoV-2 virus
  (3CLPro) and human cancer cell target protein (RTCB) benchmarks and demonstrated
  that, in both benchmarks, ERP consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art
  algorithm by 1-5 percent, and baselines by 5-10 percent, respectively. Moreover,
  such improvement is robust across Transformer models trained with different objectives.
  Finally, to further illustrate the capabilities of ERP, we tested our algorithm
  on three code generation benchmarks and outperformed the current state-of-the-art
  approach as well. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/xuefeng-cs/ERP.'
