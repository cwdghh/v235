title: Learning High-Frequency Functions Made Easy with Sinusoidal Positional Encoding
openreview: qqPL0DkcrI
abstract: Fourier features based positional encoding (PE) is commonly used in machine
  learning tasks that involve learning high-frequency features from low-dimensional
  inputs, such as 3D view synthesis and time series regression with neural tangent
  kernels. Despite their effectiveness, existing PEs require manual, empirical adjustment
  of crucial hyperparameters, specifically the Fourier features, tailored to each
  unique task. Further, PEs face challenges in efficiently learning high-frequency
  functions, particularly in tasks with limited data. In this paper, we introduce
  sinusoidal PE (SPE), designed to efficiently learn adaptive frequency features closely
  aligned with the true underlying function. Our experiments demonstrate that SPE,
  without hyperparameter tuning, consistently achieves enhanced fidelity and faster
  training across various tasks, including 3D view synthesis, Text-to-Speech generation,
  and 1D regression. SPE is implemented as a direct replacement for existing PEs.
  Its plug-and-play nature lets numerous tasks easily adopt and benefit from SPE.
