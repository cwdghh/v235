title: Diffusion Models Demand Contrastive Guidance for Adversarial Purification to
  Advance
openreview: 2NUGeV64y2
abstract: In adversarial defense, adversarial purification can be viewed as a special
  generation task with the purpose to remove adversarial attacks and diffusion models
  excel in adversarial purification for their strong generative power. With different
  predetermined generation requirements, various types of guidance have been proposed,
  but few of them focuses on adversarial purification. In this work, we propose to
  guide diffusion models for adversarial purification using contrastive guidance.
  We theoretically derive the proper noise level added in the forward process diffusion
  models for adversarial purification from a feature learning perspective. For the
  reverse process, it is implied that the role of contrastive loss guidance is to
  facilitate the evolution towards the signal direction. From the theoretical findings
  and implications, we design the forward process with the proper amount of Gaussian
  noise added and the reverse process with the gradient of contrastive loss as the
  guidance of diffusion models for adversarial purification. Empirically, extensive
  experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark
  and ImageNet datasets with ResNet and WideResNet classifiers show that our method
  outperforms most of current adversarial training and adversarial purification methods
  by a large improvement.
