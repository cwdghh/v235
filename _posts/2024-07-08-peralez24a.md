title: 'Solving Hierarchical Information-Sharing Dec-POMDPs: An Extensive-Form Game
  Approach'
openreview: n3smZl8itR
abstract: A recent theory shows that a multi-player decentralized partially observable
  Markov decision process can be transformed into an equivalent single-player game,
  enabling the application of Bellman’s principle of optimality to solve the single-player
  game by breaking it down into single-stage subgames. However, this approach entangles
  the decision variables of all players at each single-stage subgame, resulting in
  backups with a double-exponential complexity. This paper demonstrates how to disentangle
  these decision variables while maintaining optimality under hierarchical information
  sharing, a prominent management style in our society. To achieve this, we apply
  the principle of optimality to solve any single-stage subgame by breaking it down
  further into smaller subgames, enabling us to make single-player decisions at a
  time. Our approach reveals that extensive-form games always exist with solutions
  to a single-stage subgame, significantly reducing time complexity. Our experimental
  results show that the algorithms leveraging these findings can scale up to much
  larger multi-player games without compromising optimality.
