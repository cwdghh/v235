title: 'Position: Amazing Things Come From Having Many Good Models'
openreview: oFDFGd9Age
abstract: The <em>Rashomon Effect</em>, coined by Leo Breiman, describes the phenomenon
  that there exist many equally good predictive models for the same dataset. This
  phenomenon happens for many real datasets and when it does, it sparks both magic
  and consternation, but mostly magic. In light of the Rashomon Effect, this perspective
  piece proposes reshaping the way we think about machine learning, particularly for
  tabular data problems in the nondeterministic (noisy) setting. We address how the
  Rashomon Effect impacts (1) the existence of simple-yet-accurate models, (2) flexibility
  to address user preferences, such as fairness and monotonicity, without losing performance,
  (3) uncertainty in predictions, fairness, and explanations, (4) reliable variable
  importance, (5) algorithm choice, specifically, providing advanced knowledge of
  which algorithms might be suitable for a given problem, and (6) public policy. We
  also discuss a theory of when the Rashomon Effect occurs and why. Our goal is to
  illustrate how the Rashomon Effect can have a massive impact on the use of machine
  learning for complex problems in society.
