title: On Universally Optimal Algorithms for A/B Testing
openreview: ft5jK9uPgC
abstract: We study the problem of best-arm identification with fixed budget in stochastic
  multi-armed bandits with Bernoulli rewards. For the problem with two arms, also
  known as the A/B testing problem, we prove that there is no algorithm that (i) performs
  as well as the algorithm sampling each arm equally (referred to as the <em>uniform
  sampling</em> algorithm) in all instances, and that (ii) strictly outperforms uniform
  sampling on at least one instance. In short, there is no algorithm better than the
  uniform sampling algorithm. To establish this result, we first introduce the natural
  class of <em>consistent</em> and <em>stable</em> algorithms, and show that any algorithm
  that performs as well as the uniform sampling algorithm in all instances belongs
  to this class. The proof then proceeds by deriving a lower bound on the error rate
  satisfied by any consistent and stable algorithm, and by showing that the uniform
  sampling algorithm matches this lower bound. Our results provide a solution to the
  two open problems presented in (Qin, 2022). For the general problem with more than
  two arms, we provide a first set of results. We characterize the asymptotic error
  rate of the celebrated Successive Rejects (SR) algorithm (Audibert et al., 2010)
  and show that, surprisingly, the uniform sampling algorithm outperforms the SR algorithm
  in some instances.
