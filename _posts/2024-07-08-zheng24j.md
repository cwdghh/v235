title: Conformal Predictions under Markovian Data
openreview: efzkSbpyRw
abstract: We study the split Conformal Prediction method when applied to Markovian
  data. We quantify the gap in terms of coverage induced by the correlations in the
  data (compared to exchangeable data). This gap strongly depends on the mixing properties
  of the underlying Markov chain, and we prove that it typically scales as $\sqrt{t_\mathrm{mix}\ln(n)/n}$
  (where $t_\mathrm{mix}$ is the mixing time of the chain). We also derive upper bounds
  on the impact of the correlations on the size of the prediction set. Finally we
  present $K$-split CP, a method that consists in thinning the calibration dataset
  and that adapts to the mixing properties of the chain. Its coverage gap is reduced
  to $t_\mathrm{mix}/(n\ln(n))$ without really affecting the size of the prediction
  set. We finally test our algorithms on synthetic and real-world datasets.
