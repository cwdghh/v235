title: Learning-Efficient Yet Generalizable Collaborative Filtering for Item Recommendation
openreview: D5IRvFF1lN
abstract: The weighted squared loss is a common component in several Collaborative
  Filtering (CF) algorithms for item recommendation, including the representative
  implicit Alternating Least Squares (iALS). Despite its widespread use, this loss
  function lacks a clear connection to ranking objectives such as Discounted Cumulative
  Gain (DCG), posing a fundamental challenge in explaining the exceptional ranking
  performance observed in these algorithms. In this work, we make a breakthrough by
  establishing a connection between squared loss and ranking metrics through a Taylor
  expansion of the DCG-consistent surrogate lossâ€”softmax loss. We also discover a
  new surrogate squared loss function, namely Ranking-Generalizable Squared (RG$^2$)
  loss, and conduct thorough theoretical analyses on the DCG-consistency of the proposed
  loss function. Later, we present an example of utilizing the RG$^2$ loss with Matrix
  Factorization (MF), coupled with a generalization upper bound and an ALS optimization
  algorithm that leverages closed-form solutions over all items. Experimental results
  over three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the RG$^2$ loss, exhibiting
  ranking performance on par with, or even surpassing, the softmax loss while achieving
  faster convergence.
