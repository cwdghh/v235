title: 'Position: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis'
openreview: BH8TYy0r6u
abstract: 'We argue that representations in AI models, particularly deep networks,
  are converging. First, we survey many examples of convergence in the literature:
  over time and across multiple domains, the ways by which different neural networks
  represent data are becoming more aligned. Next, we demonstrate convergence across
  data modalities: as vision models and language models get larger, they measure distance
  between datapoints in a more and more alike way. We hypothesize that this convergence
  is driving toward a shared statistical model of reality, akin to Platoâ€™s concept
  of an ideal reality. We term such a representation the platonic representation and
  discuss several possible selective pressures toward it. Finally, we discuss the
  implications of these trends, their limitations, and counterexamples to our analysis.'
