title: Equivariant Diffusion for Crystal Structure Prediction
openreview: VRv8KjJNuj
abstract: In addressing the challenge of Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP), symmetry-aware
  deep learning models, particularly diffusion models, have been extensively studied,
  which treat CSP as a conditional generation task. However, ensuring permutation,
  rotation, and periodic translation equivariance during diffusion process remains
  incompletely addressed. In this work, we propose EquiCSP, a novel equivariant diffusion-based
  generative model. We not only address the overlooked issue of lattice permutation
  equivariance in existing models, but also develop a unique noising algorithm that
  rigorously maintains periodic translation equivariance throughout both training
  and inference processes. Our experiments indicate that EquiCSP significantly surpasses
  existing models in terms of generating accurate structures and demonstrates faster
  convergence during the training process.
