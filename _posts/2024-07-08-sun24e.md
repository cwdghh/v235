title: 'DFA-RAG: Conversational Semantic Router for Large Language Model with Definite
  Finite Automaton'
openreview: LpAzlcGzJ6
abstract: This paper introduces the retrieval-augmented large language model with
  Definite Finite Automaton (DFA-RAG), a novel framework designed to enhance the capabilities
  of conversational agents using large language models (LLMs). Traditional LLMs face
  challenges in generating regulated and compliant responses in special scenarios
  with predetermined response guidelines, like emotional support and customer service.
  Our framework addresses these challenges by embedding a Definite Finite Automaton
  (DFA), learned from training dialogues, within the LLM. This structured approach
  acts as a semantic router which enables the LLM to adhere to a deterministic response
  pathway. The routing is achieved by the retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG)
  strategy, which carefully selects dialogue examples aligned with the current conversational
  context. The advantages of DFA-RAG include an interpretable structure through human-readable
  DFA, context-aware retrieval for responses in conversations, and plug-and-play compatibility
  with existing LLMs. Extensive benchmarks validate DFA-RAGâ€™s effectiveness, indicating
  its potential as a valuable contribution to the conversational agent.
