title: 'Promptbreeder: Self-Referential Self-Improvement via Prompt Evolution'
openreview: 9ZxnPZGmPU
abstract: Popular prompt strategies like Chain-of-Thought Prompting can dramatically
  improve the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various domains.
  However, such hand-crafted prompt-strategies are often sub-optimal. In this paper,
  we present Promptbreeder, a general-purpose self-referential self-improvement mechanism
  that evolves and adapts prompts for a given domain. Driven by an LLM, Promptbreeder
  mutates a population of task-prompts, evaluates them for fitness on a training set,
  and repeats this process over multiple generations to evolve task-prompts. Crucially,
  the mutation of these task-prompts is governed by mutation-prompts that the LLM
  generates and improves throughout evolution in a self-referential way. That is,
  Promptbreeder is not just improving task-prompts, but it is also improving the mutation-prompts
  that improve these task-prompts. Promptbreeder outperforms state-of-the-art prompt
  strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and Plan-and-Solve Prompting on commonly used
  arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, Promptbreeder is able
  to evolve intricate task-prompts for the challenging problem of hate speech classification.
