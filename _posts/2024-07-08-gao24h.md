title: 'DMTG: One-Shot Differentiable Multi-Task Grouping'
openreview: lcX5GbDIi8
abstract: We aim to address Multi-Task Learning (MTL) with a large number of tasks
  by Multi-Task Grouping (MTG). Given $N$ tasks, we propose to <b>simultaneously identify
  the best task groups from $2^N$ candidates and train the model weights simultaneously
  in one-shot</b>, with <b>the high-order task-affinity fully exploited</b>. This
  is distinct from the pioneering methods which sequentially identify the groups and
  train the model weights, where the group identification often relies on heuristics.
  As a result, our method not only improves the training efficiency, but also mitigates
  the objective bias introduced by the sequential procedures that potentially leads
  to a suboptimal solution. Specifically, <b>we formulate MTG as a fully differentiable
  pruning problem on an adaptive network architecture determined by an unknown Categorical
  distribution</b>. To categorize $N$ tasks into $K$ groups (represented by $K$ encoder
  branches), we initially set up $KN$ task heads, where each branch connects to all
  $N$ task heads to exploit the high-order task-affinity. Then, we gradually prune
  the $KN$ heads down to $N$ by learning a relaxed differentiable Categorical distribution,
  ensuring that each task is exclusively and uniquely categorized into only one branch.
  Extensive experiments on CelebA and Taskonomy datasets with detailed ablations show
  the promising performance and efficiency of our method. The codes are available
  at https://github.com/ethanygao/DMTG.
