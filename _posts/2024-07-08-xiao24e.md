title: Uniformly Stable Algorithms for Adversarial Training and Beyond
openreview: odCl49tWA6
abstract: In adversarial machine learning, neural networks suffer from a significant
  issue known as robust overfitting, where the robust test accuracy decreases over
  epochs (Rice et al., 2020). Recent research conducted by Xing et al., 2021;Xiao
  et al., 2022 has focused on studying the uniform stability of adversarial training.
  Their investigations revealed that SGD-based adversarial training fails to exhibit
  uniform stability, and the derived stability bounds align with the observed phenomenon
  of robust overfitting in experiments. This finding motivates us to develop uniformly
  stable algorithms specifically tailored for adversarial training. To this aim, we
  introduce Moreau envelope-$\mathcal{A}$ (ME-$\mathcal{A}$), a variant of the Moreau
  Envelope-type algorithm. We employ a Moreau envelope function to reframe the original
  problem as a min-min problem, separating the non-strong convexity and non-smoothness
  of the adversarial loss. Then, this approach alternates between solving the inner
  and outer minimization problems to achieve uniform stability without incurring additional
  computational overhead. In practical scenarios, we demonstrate the efficacy of ME-$\mathcal{A}$
  in mitigating the issue of robust overfitting. Beyond its application in adversarial
  training, this represents a fundamental result in uniform stability analysis, as
  ME-$\mathcal{A}$ is the first algorithm to exhibit uniform stability for weakly-convex,
  non-smooth problems.
