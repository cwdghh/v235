title: Multigroup Robustness
openreview: Nue7KgVZ6e
abstract: To address the shortcomings of real-world datasets, robust learning algorithms
  have been designed to overcome arbitrary and indiscriminate data corruption. However,
  practical processes of gathering data may lead to patterns of data corruption that
  are localized to specific partitions of the training dataset. Motivated by critical
  applications where the learned model is deployed to make predictions about people
  from a rich collection of overlapping subpopulations, we initiate the study of <em>multigroup
  robust</em> algorithms whose robustness guarantees for each subpopulation only degrade
  with the amount of data corruption <em>inside</em> that subpopulation. When the
  data corruption is not distributed uniformly over subpopulations, our algorithms
  provide more meaningful robustness guarantees than standard guarantees that are
  oblivious to how the data corruption and the affected subpopulations are related.
  Our techniques establish a new connection between multigroup fairness and robustness.
