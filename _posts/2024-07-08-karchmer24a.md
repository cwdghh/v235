title: On Stronger Computational Separations Between Multimodal and Unimodal Machine
  Learning
openreview: 8Z2xWhuT6R
abstract: Recently, multimodal machine learning has enjoyed huge empirical success
  (e.g. GPT-4). Motivated to develop theoretical justification for this empirical
  success, Lu (NeurIPS ’23, ALT ’24) introduces a theory of multimodal learning, and
  considers possible <em>separations</em> between theoretical models of multimodal
  and unimodal learning. In particular, Lu (ALT ’24) shows a computational separation,
  which is relevant to <em>worst-case</em> instances of the learning task. In this
  paper, we give a stronger <em>average-case</em> computational separation, where
  for "typical" instances of the learning task, unimodal learning is computationally
  hard, but multimodal learning is easy. We then question how "natural" the average-case
  separation is. Would it be encountered in practice? To this end, we prove that under
  basic conditions, any given computational separation between average-case unimodal
  and multimodal learning tasks implies a corresponding cryptographic key agreement
  protocol. We suggest to interpret this as evidence that very strong <em>computational</em>
  advantages of multimodal learning may arise <em>infrequently</em> in practice, since
  they exist only for the "pathological" case of inherently cryptographic distributions.
  However, this does not apply to possible (super-polynomial) <em>statistical</em>
  advantages.
