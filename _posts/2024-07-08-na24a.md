title: Diffusion Rejection Sampling
openreview: EsWJ5wd2ir
abstract: Recent advances in powerful pre-trained diffusion models encourage the development
  of methods to improve the sampling performance under well-trained diffusion models.
  This paper introduces Diffusion Rejection Sampling (DiffRS), which uses a rejection
  sampling scheme that aligns the sampling transition kernels with the true ones at
  each timestep. The proposed method can be viewed as a mechanism that evaluates the
  quality of samples at each intermediate timestep and refines them with varying effort
  depending on the sample. Theoretical analysis shows that DiffRS can achieve a tighter
  bound on sampling error compared to pre-trained models. Empirical results demonstrate
  the state-of-the-art performance of DiffRS on the benchmark datasets and the effectiveness
  of DiffRS for fast diffusion samplers and large-scale text-to-image diffusion models.
