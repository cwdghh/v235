title: Generative Conditional Distributions by Neural (Entropic) Optimal Transport
openreview: FoRqdsN4IA
abstract: 'Learning conditional distributions is challenging because the desired outcome
  is not a single distribution but multiple distributions that correspond to multiple
  instances of the covariates. We introduce a novel neural entropic optimal transport
  method designed to effectively learn generative models of conditional distributions,
  particularly in scenarios characterized by limited sample sizes. Our method relies
  on the minimax training of two neural networks: a generative network parametrizing
  the inverse cumulative distribution functions of the conditional distributions and
  another network parametrizing the conditional Kantorovich potential. To prevent
  overfitting, we regularize the objective function by penalizing the Lipschitz constant
  of the network output. Our experiments on real-world datasets show the effectiveness
  of our algorithm compared to state-of-the-art conditional distribution learning
  techniques. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/nguyenngocbaocmt02/GENTLE.'
