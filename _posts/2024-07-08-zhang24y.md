title: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Controls
openreview: C4nalr0DoE
abstract: In contrast to the prevailing interpretation of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
  as a means of simulating weight changes in model adaptation, this paper introduces
  an alternative perspective by framing it as a control process. Specifically, we
  conceptualize lightweight matrices in LoRA as control modules tasked with perturbing
  the original, complex, yet frozen blocks on downstream tasks. Building upon this
  new understanding, we conduct a thorough analysis on the controllability of these
  modules, where we identify and establish sufficient conditions that facilitate their
  effective integration into downstream controls. Moreover, the control modules are
  redesigned by incorporating nonlinearities through a parameter-free attention mechanism.
  This modification allows for the intermingling of tokens within the controllers,
  enhancing the adaptability and performance of the system. Empirical findings substantiate
  that, without introducing any additional parameters, this approach surpasses the
  existing LoRA algorithms across all assessed datasets and rank configurations.
