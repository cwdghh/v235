title: Learning to Scale Logits for Temperature-Conditional GFlowNets
openreview: GUEsK9xJny
abstract: GFlowNets are probabilistic models that sequentially generate compositional
  structures through a stochastic policy. Among GFlowNets, temperature-conditional
  GFlowNets can introduce temperature-based controllability for exploration and exploitation.
  We propose <em>Logit-scaling GFlowNets</em> (Logit-GFN), a novel architectural design
  that greatly accelerates the training of temperature-conditional GFlowNets. It is
  based on the idea that previously proposed approaches introduced numerical challenges
  in the deep network training, since different temperatures may give rise to very
  different gradient profiles as well as magnitudes of the policy’s logits. We find
  that the challenge is greatly reduced if a learned function of the temperature is
  used to scale the policy’s logits directly. Also, using Logit-GFN, GFlowNets can
  be improved by having better generalization capabilities in offline learning and
  mode discovery capabilities in online learning, which is empirically verified in
  various biological and chemical tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/dbsxodud-11/logit-gfn
