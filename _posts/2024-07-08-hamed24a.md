title: 'Dr. Strategy: Model-Based Generalist Agents with Strategic Dreaming'
openreview: HsseRq2FAx
abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) has been a primary approach to
  ameliorating the sample efficiency issue as well as to make a generalist agent.
  However, there has not been much effort toward enhancing the strategy of dreaming
  itself. Therefore, it is a question <em>whether and how an agent can “</em>dream
  better<em>”</em> in a more structured and strategic way. In this paper, inspired
  by the observation from cognitive science suggesting that humans use a spatial divide-and-conquer
  strategy in planning, we propose a new MBRL agent, called <b>Dr. Strategy</b>, which
  is equipped with a novel <b>Dr</b>eaming <b>Strategy</b>. The proposed agent realizes
  a version of divide-and-conquer-like strategy in dreaming. This is achieved by learning
  a set of latent landmarks and then utilizing these to learn a landmark-conditioned
  highway policy. With the highway policy, the agent can first learn in the dream
  to move to a landmark, and from there it tackles the exploration and achievement
  task in a more focused way. In experiments, we show that the proposed model outperforms
  prior pixel-based MBRL methods in various visually complex and partially observable
  navigation tasks.
