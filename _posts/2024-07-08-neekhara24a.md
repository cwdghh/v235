title: 'SelfVC: Voice Conversion With Iterative Refinement using Self Transformations'
openreview: 6kMMgmeM2U
abstract: We propose SelfVC, a training strategy to iteratively improve a voice conversion
  model with self-synthesized examples. Previous efforts on voice conversion focus
  on factorizing speech into explicitly disentangled representations that separately
  encode speaker characteristics and linguistic content. However, disentangling speech
  representations to capture such attributes using task-specific loss terms can lead
  to information loss. In this work, instead of explicitly disentangling attributes
  with loss terms, we present a framework to train a controllable voice conversion
  model on entangled speech representations derived from self-supervised learning
  (SSL) and speaker verification models. First, we develop techniques to derive prosodic
  information from the audio signal and SSL representations to train predictive submodules
  in the synthesis model. Next, we propose a training strategy to iteratively improve
  the synthesis model for voice conversion, by creating a challenging training objective
  using self-synthesized examples. We demonstrate that incorporating such self-synthesized
  examples during training improves the speaker similarity of generated speech as
  compared to a baseline voice conversion model trained solely on heuristically perturbed
  inputs. Our framework is trained without any text and achieves state-of-the-art
  results in zero-shot voice conversion on metrics evaluating naturalness, speaker
  similarity, and intelligibility of synthesized audio.
