title: 'RL-VLM-F: Reinforcement Learning from Vision Language Foundation Model Feedback'
openreview: YSoMmNWZZx
abstract: 'Reward engineering has long been a challenge in Reinforcement Learning
  (RL) research, as it often requires extensive human effort and iterative processes
  of trial-and-error to design effective reward functions. In this paper, we propose
  RL-VLM-F, a method that automatically generates reward functions for agents to learn
  new tasks, using only a text description of the task goal and the agent’s visual
  observations, by leveraging feedbacks from vision language foundation models (VLMs).
  The key to our approach is to query these models to give preferences over pairs
  of the agent’s image observations based on the text description of the task goal,
  and then learn a reward function from the preference labels, rather than directly
  prompting these models to output a raw reward score, which can be noisy and inconsistent.
  We demonstrate that RL-VLM-F successfully produces effective rewards and policies
  across various domains — including classic control, as well as manipulation of rigid,
  articulated, and deformable objects — without the need for human supervision, outperforming
  prior methods that use large pretrained models for reward generation under the same
  assumptions. Videos can be found on our project website: https://rlvlmf2024.github.io/'
