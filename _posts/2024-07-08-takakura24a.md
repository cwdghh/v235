title: Mean-field Analysis on Two-layer Neural Networks from a Kernel Perspective
openreview: mphq2jMFLZ
abstract: In this paper, we study the feature learning ability of two-layer neural
  networks in the mean-field regime through the lens of kernel methods. To focus on
  the dynamics of the kernel induced by the first layer, we utilize a two-timescale
  limit, where the second layer moves much faster than the first layer. In this limit,
  the learning problem is reduced to the minimization problem over the intrinsic kernel.
  Then, we show the global convergence of the mean-field Langevin dynamics and derive
  time and particle discretization error. We also demonstrate that two-layer neural
  networks can learn a union of multiple reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces more efficiently
  than any kernel methods, and neural networks aquire data-dependent kernel which
  aligns with the target function. In addition, we develop a label noise procedure,
  which converges to the global optimum and show that the degrees of freedom appears
  as an implicit reguralization.
