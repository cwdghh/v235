title: Counterfactual Metarules for Local and Global Recourse
openreview: Ad9msn1SKC
abstract: We introduce <b>T-CREx</b>, a novel model-agnostic method for local and
  global counterfactual explanation (CE), which summarises recourse options for both
  individuals and groups in the form of generalised rules. It leverages tree-based
  surrogate models to learn the counterfactual rules, alongside <em>metarules</em>
  denoting their regimes of optimality, providing both a global analysis of model
  behaviour and diverse recourse options for users. Experiments indicate that <b>T-CREx</b>
  achieves superior aggregate performance over existing rule-based baselines on a
  range of CE desiderata, while being orders of magnitude faster to run.
