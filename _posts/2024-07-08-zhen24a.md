title: '3D-VLA: A 3D Vision-Language-Action Generative World Model'
openreview: EZcFK8HupF
abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models rely on 2D inputs, lacking integration
  with the broader realm of the 3D physical world. Furthermore, they perform action
  prediction by learning a direct mapping from perception to action, neglecting the
  vast dynamics of the world and the relations between actions and dynamics. In contrast,
  human beings are endowed with world models that depict imagination about future
  scenarios to plan action accordingly. To this end, we propose 3D-VLA by introducing
  a new family of embodied foundation models that seamlessly link 3D perception, reasoning,
  and action through a generative world model. Specifically, 3D-VLA is built on top
  of a 3D-based large language model (LLM) and a set of action tokens is introduced
  to engage with the embodied environment. Furthermore, to inject generation abilities
  into the model, we train the embodied diffusion models and align them into the LLM
  for predicting the goal image and point cloud. To train our 3D-VLA, we curate a
  large-scale 3D embodied instruction dataset by extracting vast 3D-related information
  from existing robotics datasets. Our experiments on held-in datasets demonstrate
  that 3D-VLA significantly improves the reasoning, multimodality generation and planning
  capabilities in embodied environments, showcasing its potential in real-world applications.
