title: Discovering Features with Synergistic Interactions in Multiple Views
openreview: hFEgae0od4
abstract: Discovering features with synergistic interactions in multi-view data, that
  provide more information gain when considered together than when considered separately,
  is particularly valuable. This fosters a more comprehensive understanding of the
  target outcome from diverse perspectives (views). However, despite the increasing
  opportunities presented by multi-view data, surprisingly little attention has been
  paid to uncovering these crucial interactions. To address this gap, we formally
  define the problem of selecting synergistic and non-synergistic feature subsets
  in multi-view data, leveraging an information-theoretic concept known as interaction
  information. To this end, we introduce a novel deep learning-based feature selection
  method that identifies different interactions across multiple views, employing a
  Bernoulli relaxation technique to solve this intractable subset searching problem.
  Experiments on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world multi-view datasets demonstrate
  that our model discovers relevant feature subsets with synergistic and non-synergistic
  interactions, achieving remarkable similarity to the ground truth. Furthermore,
  we corroborate the discovered features with supporting medical and scientific literature,
  underscoring its utility in elucidating complex dependencies and interactions in
  multi-view data.
