title: Sparse-to-dense Multimodal Image Registration via Multi-Task Learning
openreview: q0vILV7zAw
abstract: 'Aligning image pairs captured by different sensors or those undergoing
  significant appearance changes is crucial for various computer vision and robotics
  applications. Existing approaches cope with this problem via either Sparse feature
  Matching (SM) or Dense direct Alignment (DA) paradigms. Sparse methods are efficient
  but lack accuracy in textureless scenes, while dense ones are more accurate in all
  scenes but demand for good initialization. In this paper, we propose SDME, a Sparse-to-Dense
  Multimodal feature Extractor based on a novel multi-task network that simultaneously
  predicts SM and DA features for robust multimodal image registration. We propose
  the sparse-to-dense registration paradigm: we first perform initial registration
  via SM and then refine the result via DA. By using the well-designed SDME, the sparse-to-dense
  approach combines the merits from both SM and DA. Extensive experiments on MSCOCO,
  GoogleEarth, VIS-NIR and VIS-IR-drone datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
  remarkable performance on multimodal cases. Furthermore, our approach exhibits robust
  generalization capabilities, enabling the fine-tuning of models initially trained
  on single-modal datasets for use with smaller multimodal datasets. Our code is available
  at https://github.com/KN-Zhang/SDME.'
