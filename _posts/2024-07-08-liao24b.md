title: Bootstrapping Fisher Market Equilibrium and First-Price Pacing Equilibrium
openreview: PApqOVbHYF
abstract: Linear Fisher market (LFM) is an equilibrium model for fair and efficient
  resource allocation, and first-price pacing equilibrium (FPPE) is a model for budget-management
  in first-price auctions. One thing they have in common is that both have a corresponding
  Eisenberg-Gale convex program characterization. In this paper, we introduce and
  devise several statistically valid bootstrap inference procedures for LFM and FPPE.
  The most challenging part is to bootstrap general FPPE, which reduces to bootstrapping
  constrained M-estimators, a largely unexplored problem. We are able to devise a
  bootstrap procedure for FPPE with structures by using the powerful tool of epi-convergence
  theory. Experiments with synthetic and semi-real data verify our theory.
