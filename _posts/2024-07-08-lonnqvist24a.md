title: 'Latent Noise Segmentation: How Neural Noise Leads to the Emergence of Segmentation
  and Grouping'
openreview: tSjyKR8WIf
abstract: 'Humans are able to segment images effortlessly without supervision using
  perceptual grouping. Here, we propose a counter-intuitive computational approach
  to solving unsupervised perceptual grouping and segmentation: that they arise <em>because</em>
  of neural noise, rather than in spite of it. We (1) mathematically demonstrate that
  under realistic assumptions, neural noise can be used to separate objects from each
  other; (2) that adding noise in a DNN enables the network to segment images even
  though it was never trained on any segmentation labels; and (3) that segmenting
  objects using noise results in segmentation performance that aligns with the perceptual
  grouping phenomena observed in humans, and is sample-efficient. We introduce the
  Good Gestalt (GG) datasets â€” six datasets designed to specifically test perceptual
  grouping, and show that our DNN models reproduce many important phenomena in human
  perception, such as illusory contours, closure, continuity, proximity, and occlusion.
  Finally, we (4) show that our model improves performance on our GG datasets compared
  to other tested unsupervised models by $24.9$%. Together, our results suggest a
  novel unsupervised segmentation method requiring few assumptions, a new explanation
  for the formation of perceptual grouping, and a novel potential benefit of neural
  noise.'
