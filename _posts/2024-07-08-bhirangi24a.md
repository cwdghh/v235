title: Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling
openreview: TK7xkOsXDu
abstract: Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data is a ubiquitous problem across
  fields ranging from medical devices to robotics. These problems often involve using
  long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict
  sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements).
  While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems,
  they often fall short when using real-world sensors. These sensors are typically
  non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent
  drift. For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets
  since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment. In this work,
  we present Hierarchical State-Space models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique
  for continuous sequential prediction. HiSS stacks structured state-space models
  on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy. Across six real-world sensor
  datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement,
  HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs,
  S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE. Our experiments further indicate that HiSS
  demonstrates efficient scaling to smaller datasets and is compatible with existing
  data-filtering techniques. Code, datasets and videos can be found on https://hiss-csp.github.io.
