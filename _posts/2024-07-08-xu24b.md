title: 'Reprompting: Automated Chain-of-Thought Prompt Inference Through Gibbs Sampling'
openreview: D8zn1DnTuj
abstract: We introduce Reprompting, an iterative sampling algorithm that automatically
  learns the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) recipes for a given task without human intervention.
  Through Gibbs sampling, Reprompting infers the CoT recipes that work consistently
  well for a set of training samples by iteratively sampling new recipes using previously
  sampled recipes as parent prompts to solve other training problems. We conduct extensive
  experiments on 20 challenging reasoning tasks. Results show that Reprompting outperforms
  human-written CoT prompts substantially by +9.4 points on average. It also achieves
  consistently better performance than the state-of-the-art prompt optimization and
  decoding algorithms.
