title: A connection between Tempering and Entropic Mirror Descent
openreview: BtbijvkWLC
abstract: This paper explores the connections between tempering (for Sequential Monte
  Carlo; SMC) and entropic mirror descent to sample from a target probability distribution
  whose unnormalized density is known. We establish that tempering SMC corresponds
  to entropic mirror descent applied to the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
  and obtain convergence rates for the tempering iterates. Our result motivates the
  tempering iterates from an optimization point of view, showing that tempering can
  be seen as a descent scheme of the KL divergence with respect to the Fisher-Rao
  geometry, in contrast to Langevin dynamics that perform descent of the KL with respect
  to the Wasserstein-2 geometry. We exploit the connection between tempering and mirror
  descent iterates to justify common practices in SMC and derive adaptive tempering
  rules that improve over other alternative benchmarks in the literature.
