title: Fine-Grained Causal Dynamics Learning with Quantization for Improving Robustness
  in Reinforcement Learning
openreview: mrd4e8ZJjm
abstract: Causal dynamics learning has recently emerged as a promising approach to
  enhancing robustness in reinforcement learning (RL). Typically, the goal is to build
  a dynamics model that makes predictions based on the causal relationships among
  the entities. Despite the fact that causal connections often manifest only under
  certain contexts, existing approaches overlook such fine-grained relationships and
  lack a detailed understanding of the dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel
  dynamics model that infers fine-grained causal structures and employs them for prediction,
  leading to improved robustness in RL. The key idea is to jointly learn the dynamics
  model with a discrete latent variable that quantizes the state-action space into
  subgroups. This leads to recognizing meaningful context that displays sparse dependencies,
  where causal structures are learned for each subgroup throughout the training. Experimental
  results demonstrate the robustness of our method to unseen states and locally spurious
  correlations in downstream tasks where fine-grained causal reasoning is crucial.
  We further illustrate the effectiveness of our subgroup-based approach with quantization
  in discovering fine-grained causal relationships compared to prior methods.
