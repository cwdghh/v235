title: Stochastic Quantum Sampling for Non-Logconcave Distributions and Estimating
  Partition Functions
openreview: sNjxqSnXFO
abstract: We present quantum algorithms for sampling from possibly non-logconcave
  probability distributions expressed as $\pi(x) \propto \exp(-\beta f(x))$ as well
  as quantum algorithms for estimating the partition function for such distributions.
  We also incorporate a stochastic gradient oracle that implements the quantum walk
  operators inexactly by only using mini-batch gradients when $f$ can be written as
  a finite sum. One challenge of quantizing the resulting Markov chains is that they
  do not satisfy the detailed balance condition in general. Consequently, the mixing
  time of the algorithm cannot be expressed in terms of the spectral gap of the transition
  density matrix, making the quantum algorithms nontrivial to analyze. We overcame
  these challenges by first building a reference reversible Markov chain that converges
  to the target distribution, then controlling the discrepancy between our algorithmâ€™s
  output and the target distribution by using the reference Markov chain as a bridge
  to establish the total complexity. Our quantum algorithms exhibit polynomial speedups
  in terms of dimension or precision dependencies when compared to best-known classical
  algorithms under similar assumptions.
