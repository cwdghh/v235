title: 'DiffDA: a Diffusion model for weather-scale Data Assimilation'
openreview: vhMq3eAB34
abstract: The generation of initial conditions via accurate data assimilation is crucial
  for weather forecasting and climate modeling. We propose DiffDA as a denoising diffusion
  model capable of assimilating atmospheric variables using predicted states and sparse
  observations. Acknowledging the similarity between a weather forecast model and
  a denoising diffusion model dedicated to weather applications, we adapt the pretrained
  GraphCast neural network as the backbone of the diffusion model. Through experiments
  based on simulated observations from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, our method can
  produce assimilated global atmospheric data consistent with observations at 0.25$^\circ$
  ($\approx$30km) resolution globally. This marks the highest resolution achieved
  by ML data assimilation models. The experiments also show that the initial conditions
  assimilated from sparse observations (less than 0.96% of gridded data) and 48-hour
  forecast can be used for forecast models with a loss of lead time of at most 24
  hours compared to initial conditions from state-of-the-art data assimilation in
  ERA5. This enables the application of the method to real-world applications, such
  as creating reanalysis datasets with autoregressive data assimilation.
