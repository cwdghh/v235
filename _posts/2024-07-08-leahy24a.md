title: Run-Time Task Composition with Safety Semantics
openreview: E4ItiEU8Iu
abstract: 'Compositionality is a critical aspect of scalable system design. Here,
  we focus on Boolean composition of learned tasks as opposed to functional or sequential
  composition. Existing Boolean composition for Reinforcement Learning focuses on
  reaching a satisfying absorbing state in environments with discrete action spaces,
  but does not support composable safety (i.e., avoidance) constraints. We provide
  three contributions: i) introduce two distinct notions of compositional safety semantics;
  ii) show how to enforce either safety semantics, prove correctness, and analyze
  the trade-offs between the two safety notions; and iii) extend Boolean composition
  from discrete action spaces to continuous action spaces. We demonstrate these techniques
  using modified versions of value iteration in a grid world, Deep Q-Network (DQN)
  in a grid world with image observations, and Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) in a continuous-observation
  and continuous-action Bullet physics environment'
