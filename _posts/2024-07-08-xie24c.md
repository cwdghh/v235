title: 'FedREDefense: Defending against Model Poisoning Attacks for Federated Learning
  using Model Update Reconstruction Error'
openreview: Wjq2bS7fTK
abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces threats from model poisoning attacks. Existing
  defenses, typically relying on cross-client/global information to mitigate these
  attacks, fall short when faced with non-IID data distributions and/or a large number
  of malicious clients. To address these challenges, we present FedREDefense. Unlike
  existing methods, it doesn’t hinge on similar distributions across clients or a
  predominant presence of benign clients. Instead, it assesses the likelihood that
  a client’s model update is a product of genuine training, solely based on the characteristics
  of the model update itself. Our key finding is that model updates stemming from
  genuine training can be approximately reconstructed with some distilled local knowledge,
  while those from deliberate handcrafted model poisoning attacks cannot. Drawing
  on this distinction, FedREDefense identifies and filters out malicious clients based
  on the discrepancies in their model update Reconstruction Errors. Empirical tests
  on three benchmark datasets confirm that FedREDefense successfully filters model
  poisoning attacks in FL—even in scenarios with high non-IID degrees and large numbers
  of malicious clients.
