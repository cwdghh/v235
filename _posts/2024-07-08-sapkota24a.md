title: Meta Evidential Transformer for Few-Shot Open-Set Recognition
openreview: CquFGSIU6w
abstract: Few-shot open-set recognition (FSOSR) aims to detect instances from unseen
  classes by utilizing a small set of labeled instances from closed-set classes. Accurately
  rejecting instances from open-set classes in the few-shot setting is fundamentally
  more challenging due to the weaker supervised signals resulting from fewer labels.
  Transformer-based few-shot methods exploit attention mapping to achieve a consistent
  representation. However, the softmax-generated attention map normalizes all the
  instances that assign unnecessary high attentive weights to those instances not
  close to the closed-set classes that negatively impact the detection performance.
  In addition, open-set samples that are similar to a certain closed-set class also
  pose a significant challenge to most existing FSOSR models. To address these challenges,
  we propose a novel Meta Evidential Transformer (MET) based FSOSR model that uses
  an evidential open-set loss to learn more compact closed-set class representations
  by effectively leveraging similar closed-set classes. MET further integrates an
  evidence-to-variance ratio to detect fundamentally challenging tasks and uses an
  evidence-guided cross-attention mechanism to better separate the difficult open-set
  samples. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate consistent improvement over
  existing competitive methods in unseen class recognition without deteriorating closed-set
  performance.
