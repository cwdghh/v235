title: Neural Collapse in Multi-label Learning with Pick-all-label Loss
openreview: y8NevOhrnW
abstract: 'We study deep neural networks for the multi-label classification (MLab)
  task through the lens of neural collapse (NC). Previous works have been restricted
  to the multi-class classification setting and discovered a prevalent NC phenomenon
  comprising of the following properties for the last-layer features: (i) the variability
  of features within every class collapses to zero, (ii) the set of feature means
  form an equi-angular tight frame (ETF), and (iii) the last layer classifiers collapse
  to the feature mean upon some scaling. We generalize the study to multi-label learning,
  and prove for the first time that a generalized NC phenomenon holds with the "pick-all-label‚Äù
  formulation, which we term as MLab NC. While the ETF geometry remains consistent
  for features with a single label, multi-label scenarios introduce a unique combinatorial
  aspect we term the "tag-wise average" property, where the means of features with
  multiple labels are the scaled averages of means for single-label instances. Theoretically,
  under proper assumptions on the features, we establish that the only global optimizer
  of the pick-all-label cross-entropy loss satisfy the multi-label NC. In practice,
  we demonstrate that our findings can lead to better test performance with more efficient
  training techniques for MLab learning.'
