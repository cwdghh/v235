title: Accelerating Convergence in Bayesian Few-Shot Classification
openreview: 9PQnc6EWdL
abstract: Bayesian few-shot classification has been a focal point in the field of
  few-shot learning. This paper seamlessly integrates mirror descent-based variational
  inference into Gaussian process-based few-shot classification, addressing the challenge
  of non-conjugate inference. By leveraging non-Euclidean geometry, mirror descent
  achieves accelerated convergence by providing the steepest descent direction along
  the corresponding manifold. It also exhibits the parameterization invariance property
  concerning the variational distribution. Experimental results demonstrate competitive
  classification accuracy, improved uncertainty quantification, and faster convergence
  compared to baseline models. Additionally, we investigate the impact of hyperparameters
  and components. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/keanson/MD-BSFC.
