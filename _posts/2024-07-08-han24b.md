title: Model Assessment and Selection under Temporal Distribution Shift
openreview: v8MgLJ7kbL
abstract: We investigate model assessment and selection in a changing environment,
  by synthesizing datasets from both the current time period and historical epochs.
  To tackle unknown and potentially arbitrary temporal distribution shift, we develop
  an adaptive rolling window approach to estimate the generalization error of a given
  model. This strategy also facilitates the comparison between any two candidate models
  by estimating the difference of their generalization errors. We further integrate
  pairwise comparisons into a single-elimination tournament, achieving near-optimal
  model selection from a collection of candidates. Theoretical analyses and empirical
  experiments underscore the adaptivity of our proposed methods to the non-stationarity
  in data.
