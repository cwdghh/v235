title: Language-Driven Cross-Modal Classifier for Zero-Shot Multi-Label Image Recognition
openreview: sHswzNWUW2
abstract: Large-scale pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have shown powerful
  zero-shot transfer capabilities in image recognition tasks. Recent approaches typically
  employ supervised fine-tuning methods to adapt CLIP for zero-shot multi-label image
  recognition tasks. However, obtaining sufficient multi-label annotated image data
  for training is challenging and not scalable. In this paper, we propose a new language-driven
  framework for zero-shot multi-label recognition that eliminates the need for annotated
  images during training. Leveraging the aligned CLIP multi-modal embedding space,
  our method utilizes language data generated by LLMs to train a cross-modal classifier,
  which is subsequently transferred to the visual modality. During inference, directly
  applying the classifier to visual inputs may limit performance due to the modality
  gap. To address this issue, we introduce a cross-modal mapping method that maps
  image embeddings to the language modality while retaining crucial visual information.
  Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other zero-shot
  multi-label recognition methods and achieves competitive results compared to few-shot
  methods.
