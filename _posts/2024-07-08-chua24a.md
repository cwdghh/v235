title: How Private are DP-SGD Implementations?
openreview: xWI0MKwJSS
abstract: 'We demonstrate a substantial gap between the privacy guarantees of the
  Adaptive Batch Linear Queries (ABLQ) mechanism under different types of batch sampling:
  (i) Shuffling, and (ii) Poisson subsampling; the typical analysis of Differentially
  Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) follows by interpreting it as a post-processing
  of ABLQ. While shuffling-based DP-SGD is more commonly used in practical implementations,
  it has not been amenable to easy privacy analysis, either analytically or even numerically.
  On the other hand, Poisson subsampling-based DP-SGD is challenging to scalably implement,
  but has a well-understood privacy analysis, with multiple open-source numerically
  tight privacy accountants available. This has led to a common practice of using
  shuffling-based DP-SGD in practice, but using the privacy analysis for the corresponding
  Poisson subsampling version. Our result shows that there can be a substantial gap
  between the privacy analysis when using the two types of batch sampling, and thus
  advises caution in reporting privacy parameters for DP-SGD.'
