title: Self-cognitive Denoising in the Presence of Multiple Noisy Label Sources
openreview: CG44RLeXt1
abstract: The strong performance of neural networks typically hinges on the availability
  of extensive labeled data, yet acquiring ground-truth labels is often challenging.
  Instead, noisy supervisions from multiple sources, e.g., by multiple well-designed
  rules, are more convenient to collect. In this paper, we focus on the realistic
  problem of learning from multiple noisy label sources, and argue that prior studies
  have overlooked the crucial <em>self-cognition</em> ability of neural networks,
  i.e., the inherent capability of autonomously distinguishing noise during training.
  We theoretically analyze this ability of neural networks when meeting multiple noisy
  label sources, which reveals that neural networks possess the capability to recognize
  both instance-wise noise within each single noisy label source and annotator-wise
  quality among multiple noisy label sources. Inspired by the theoretical analyses,
  we introduce an approach named Self-cognitive Denoising for Multiple noisy label
  sources (SDM), which exploits the self-cognition ability of neural networks to denoise
  during training. Furthermore, we build a selective distillation module following
  the theoretical insights to optimize computational efficiency. The experiments on
  various datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.
