title: 'KernelWarehouse: Rethinking the Design of Dynamic Convolution'
openreview: 0e8SEDSpNT
abstract: Dynamic convolution learns a linear mixture of $n$ static kernels weighted
  with their input-dependent attentions, demonstrating superior performance than normal
  convolution. However, it increases the number of convolutional parameters by $n$
  times, and thus is not parameter efficient. This leads to no research progress that
  can allow researchers to explore the setting $n > 100$ (an order of magnitude larger
  than the typical setting $n < 10$) for pushing forward the performance boundary
  of dynamic convolution while enjoying parameter efficiency. To fill this gap, in
  this paper, we propose KernelWarehouse, a more general form of dynamic convolution,
  which redefines the basic concepts of “kernels”, “assembling kernels” and “attention
  function” through the lens of exploiting convolutional parameter dependencies within
  the same layer and across neighboring layers of a ConvNet. We testify the effectiveness
  of KernelWarehouse on ImageNet and MS-COCO datasets using various ConvNet architectures.
  Intriguingly, KernelWarehouse is also applicable to Vision Transformers, and it
  can even reduce the model size of a backbone while improving the model accuracy.
  For instance, KernelWarehouse ($n = 4$) achieves 5.61%|3.90%|4.38% absolute top-1
  accuracy gain on the ResNet18|MobileNetV2|DeiT-Tiny backbone, and KernelWarehouse
  ($n = 1/4$) with 65.10% model size reduction still achieves 2.29% gain on the ResNet18
  backbone. The code and models are available at https://github.com/OSVAI/KernelWarehouse.
