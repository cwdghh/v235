title: "$\\rm E(3)$-Equivariant Actor-Critic Methods for Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement
  Learning"
openreview: yShA4VPYZB
abstract: Identification and analysis of symmetrical patterns in the natural world
  have led to significant discoveries across various scientific fields, such as the
  formulation of gravitational laws in physics and advancements in the study of chemical
  structures. In this paper, we focus on exploiting Euclidean symmetries inherent
  in certain cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) problems and prevalent
  in many applications. We begin by formally characterizing a subclass of Markov games
  with a general notion of symmetries that admits the existence of symmetric optimal
  values and policies. Motivated by these properties, we design neural network architectures
  with symmetric constraints embedded as an inductive bias for multi-agent actor-critic
  methods. This inductive bias results in superior performance in various cooperative
  MARL benchmarks and impressive generalization capabilities such as zero-shot learning
  and transfer learning in unseen scenarios with repeated symmetric patterns.
