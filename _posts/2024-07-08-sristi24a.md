title: Contextual Feature Selection with Conditional Stochastic Gates
openreview: E6Nm3x7acv
abstract: Feature selection is a crucial tool in machine learning and is widely applied
  across various scientific disciplines. Traditional supervised methods generally
  identify a universal set of informative features for the entire population. However,
  feature relevance often varies with context, while the context itself may not directly
  affect the outcome variable. Here, we propose a novel architecture for contextual
  feature selection where the subset of selected features is conditioned on the value
  of <em>context variables</em>. Our new approach, Conditional Stochastic Gates (c-STG),
  models the importance of features using conditional Bernoulli variables whose parameters
  are predicted based on contextual variables. We introduce a hypernetwork that maps
  context variables to feature selection parameters to learn the context-dependent
  gates along with a prediction model. We further present a theoretical analysis of
  our model, indicating that it can improve performance and flexibility over population-level
  methods in complex feature selection settings. Finally, we conduct an extensive
  benchmark using simulated and real-world datasets across multiple domains demonstrating
  that c-STG can lead to improved feature selection capabilities while enhancing prediction
  accuracy and interpretability.
