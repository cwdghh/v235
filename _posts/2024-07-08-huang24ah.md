title: Faster Adaptive Decentralized Learning Algorithms
openreview: Dwc0RwiNI5
abstract: Decentralized learning recently has received increasing attention in machine
  learning due to its advantages in implementation simplicity and system robustness,
  data privacy. Meanwhile, the adaptive gradient methods show superior performances
  in many machine learning tasks such as training neural networks. Although some works
  focus on studying decentralized optimization algorithms with adaptive learning rates,
  these adaptive decentralized algorithms still suffer from high sample complexity.
  To fill these gaps, we propose a class of faster adaptive decentralized algorithms
  (i.e., AdaMDOS and AdaMDOF) for distributed nonconvex stochastic and finite-sum
  optimization, respectively. Moreover, we provide a solid convergence analysis framework
  for our methods. In particular, we prove that our AdaMDOS obtains a near-optimal
  sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary
  solution of nonconvex stochastic optimization. Meanwhile, our AdaMDOF obtains a
  near-optimal sample complexity of $O(\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-2})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary
  solution of for nonconvex finite-sum optimization, where $n$ denotes the sample
  size. To the best of our knowledge, our AdaMDOF algorithm is the first adaptive
  decentralized algorithm for nonconvex finite-sum optimization. Some experimental
  results demonstrate efficiency of our algorithms.
