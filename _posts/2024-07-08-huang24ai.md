title: 'Adversarially Robust Deep Multi-View Clustering: A Novel Attack and Defense
  Framework'
openreview: D9EfAkQCzh
abstract: Deep Multi-view Clustering (DMVC) stands out as a widely adopted technique
  aiming at enhanced clustering performance by leveraging diverse data sources. However,
  the critical issue of vulnerability to adversarial attacks is unexplored due to
  the lack of well-defined attack objectives. To fill this crucial gap, this paper
  is the first work to investigate the possibility of adversarial attacks on DMVC
  models. Specifically, we introduce an adversarial attack with Generative Adversarial
  Networks (GANs) with the aim to maximally change the complementarity and consistency
  of multiple views, thus leading to wrong clustering. Building upon this adversarial
  context, in the realm of defense, we propose a novel Adversarially Robust Deep Multi-View
  Clustering by leveraging adversarial training. Based on the analysis from an information-theoretic
  perspective, we design an Attack Mitigator that provides a foundation to guarantee
  the adversarial robustness of our DMVC models. Experiments conducted on multi-view
  datasets confirmed that our attack framework effectively reduces the clustering
  performance of the target model. Furthermore, our proposed adversarially robust
  method is also demonstrated to be an effective defense against such attacks. This
  work is a pioneer in exploring adversarial threats and advancing both theoretical
  understanding and practical strategies for robust multi-view clustering. Code is
