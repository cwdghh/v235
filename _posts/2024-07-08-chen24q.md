title: Bagged Deep Image Prior for Recovering Images in the Presence of Speckle Noise
openreview: IoUOhnCmlX
abstract: We investigate both the theoretical and algorithmic aspects of likelihood-based
  methods for recovering a complex-valued signal from multiple sets of measurements,
  referred to as looks, affected by speckle (multiplicative) noise. Our theoretical
  contributions include establishing the first existing theoretical upper bound on
  the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the maximum likelihood estimator under the deep
  image prior hypothesis. Our theoretical results capture the dependence of MSE upon
  the number of parameters in the deep image prior, the number of looks, the signal
  dimension, and the number of measurements per look. On the algorithmic side, we
  introduce the concept of bagged Deep Image Priors (Bagged-DIP) and integrate them
  with projected gradient descent. Furthermore, we show how employing Newton-Schulz
  algorithm for calculating matrix inverses within the iterations of PGD reduces the
  computational complexity of the algorithm. We will show that this method achieves
  the state-of-the-art performance.
