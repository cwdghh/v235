title: PASOA- PArticle baSed Bayesian Optimal Adaptive design
openreview: rGCvMARXkG
abstract: We propose a new procedure named PASOA, for Bayesian experimental design,
  that performs sequential design optimization by simultaneously providing accurate
  estimates of successive posterior distributions for parameter inference. The sequential
  design process is carried out via a contrastive estimation principle, using stochastic
  optimization and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers to maximise the Expected
  Information Gain (EIG). As larger information gains are obtained for larger distances
  between successive posterior distributions, this EIG objective may worsen classical
  SMC performance. To handle this issue, tempering is proposed to have both a large
  information gain and an accurate SMC sampling, that we show is crucial for performance.
  This novel combination of stochastic optimization and tempered SMC allows to jointly
  handle design optimization and parameter inference. We provide a proof that the
  obtained optimal design estimators benefit from some consistency property. Numerical
  experiments confirm the potential of the approach, which outperforms other recent
  existing procedures.
