title: Dynamic Correlation Clustering in Sublinear Update Time
openreview: 3YG55Lbcnr
abstract: We study the classic problem of correlation clustering in dynamic vertex
  streams. In this setting, vertices are either added or randomly deleted over time,
  and each vertex pair is connected by a positive or negative edge. The objective
  is to continuously find a partition which minimizes the sum of positive edges crossing
  clusters and negative edges within clusters. We present an algorithm that maintains
  an $O(1)$-approximation with $O(\text{polylog} n)$ amortized update time. Prior
  to our work Behnezhad et al. in SODA 2023 achieved a $5$-approximation with $O(1)$
  expected update time in edge streams which translates in vertex streams to an $O(D)$-update
  time where $D$ is the maximum possible degree. Finally we complement our theoretical
  analysis with experiments on real world data.
