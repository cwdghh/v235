title: 'Progressive Inference: Explaining Decoder-Only Sequence Classification Models
  Using Intermediate Predictions'
openreview: hRX1o7FBhT
abstract: This paper proposes Progressive inference–a framework to explain the predictions
  of decoder-only transformer models trained to perform sequence classification tasks.
  Our work is based on the insight that the classification head of a decoder-only
  model can be used to make intermediate predictions by evaluating them at different
  points in the input sequence. Due to the masked attention mechanism used in decoder-only
  models, these intermediate predictions only depend on the tokens seen before the
  inference point, allowing us to obtain the model’s prediction on a masked input
  sub-sequence, with negligible computational overheads. We develop two methods to
  provide sub-sequence level attributions using this core insight. First, we propose
  Single Pass-Progressive Inference (SP-PI) to compute attributions by simply taking
  the difference between intermediate predictions. Second, we exploit a connection
  with Kernel SHAP to develop Multi Pass-Progressive Inference (MP-PI); this uses
  intermediate predictions from multiple masked versions of the input to compute higher-quality
  attributions that approximate SHAP values. We perform studies on several text classification
  datasets to demonstrate that our proposal provides better explanations compared
  to prior work, both in the single-pass and multi-pass settings.
