title: 'Locally Interdependent Multi-Agent MDP: Theoretical Framework for Decentralized
  Agents with Dynamic Dependencies'
openreview: iYYA5zDoCm
abstract: Many multi-agent systems in practice are decentralized and have dynamically
  varying dependencies. There has been a lack of attempts in the literature to analyze
  these systems theoretically. In this paper, we propose and theoretically analyze
  a decentralized model with dynamically varying dependencies called the Locally Interdependent
  Multi-Agent MDP. This model can represent problems in many disparate domains such
  as cooperative navigation, obstacle avoidance, and formation control. Despite the
  intractability that general partially observable multi-agent systems suffer from,
  we propose three closed-form policies that are theoretically near-optimal in this
  setting and can be scalable to compute and store. Consequentially, we reveal a fundamental
  property of Locally Interdependent Multi-Agent MDPâ€™s that the partially observable
  decentralized solution is exponentially close to the fully observable solution with
  respect to the visibility radius. We then discuss extensions of our closed-form
  policies to further improve tractability. We conclude by providing simulations to
  investigate some long horizon behaviors of our closed-form policies.
