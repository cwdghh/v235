title: Improving Robustness to Multiple Spurious Correlations by Multi-Objective Optimization
openreview: CbbTF6tDhW
abstract: We study the problem of training an unbiased and accurate model given a
  dataset with multiple biases. This problem is challenging since the multiple biases
  cause multiple undesirable shortcuts during training, and even worse, mitigating
  one may exacerbate the other. We propose a novel training method to tackle this
  challenge. Our method first groups training data so that different groups induce
  different shortcuts, and then optimizes a linear combination of group-wise losses
  while adjusting their weights dynamically to alleviate conflicts between the groups
  in performance; this approach, rooted in the multi-objective optimization theory,
  encourages to achieve the minimax Pareto solution. We also present a new benchmark
  with multiple biases, dubbed MultiCelebA, for evaluating debiased training methods
  under realistic and challenging scenarios. Our method achieved the best on three
  datasets with multiple biases, and also showed superior performance on conventional
  single-bias datasets.
