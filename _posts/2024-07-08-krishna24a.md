title: Understanding the Effects of Iterative Prompting on Truthfulness
openreview: KjazcKPMME
abstract: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has notably transformed
  numerous sectors, offering impressive text generation capabilities. Yet, the reliability
  and truthfulness of these models remain pressing concerns. To this end, we investigate
  iterative prompting, a strategy hypothesized to refine LLM responses, assessing
  its impact on LLM truthfulness, an area which has not been thoroughly explored.
  Our extensive experiments explore the intricacies of iterative prompting variants,
  examining their influence on the accuracy and calibration of model responses. Our
  findings reveal that naive prompting methods significantly undermine truthfulness,
  leading to exacerbated calibration errors. In response to these challenges, we introduce
  several prompting variants designed to address the identified issues. These variants
  demonstrate marked improvements over existing baselines, signaling a promising direction
  for future research. Our work provides a nuanced understanding of iterative prompting
  and introduces novel approaches to enhance the truthfulness of LLMs, thereby contributing
  to the development of more accurate and trustworthy AI systems
