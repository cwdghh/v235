title: 'HarmonyDream: Task Harmonization Inside World Models'
openreview: x0yIaw2fgk
abstract: 'Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) holds the promise of sample-efficient
  learning by utilizing a world model, which models how the environment works and
  typically encompasses components for two tasks: observation modeling and reward
  modeling. In this paper, through a dedicated empirical investigation, we gain a
  deeper understanding of the role each task plays in world models and uncover the
  overlooked potential of sample-efficient MBRL by mitigating the domination of either
  observation or reward modeling. Our key insight is that while prevalent approaches
  of explicit MBRL attempt to restore abundant details of the environment via observation
  models, it is difficult due to the environmentâ€™s complexity and limited model capacity.
  On the other hand, reward models, while dominating implicit MBRL and adept at learning
  compact task-centric dynamics, are inadequate for sample-efficient learning without
  richer learning signals. Motivated by these insights and discoveries, we propose
  a simple yet effective approach, HarmonyDream, which automatically adjusts loss
  coefficients to maintain task harmonization, i.e. a dynamic equilibrium between
  the two tasks in world model learning. Our experiments show that the base MBRL method
  equipped with HarmonyDream gains 10%-69% absolute performance boosts on visual robotic
  tasks and sets a new state-of-the-art result on the Atari 100K benchmark. Code is
  available at https://github.com/thuml/HarmonyDream.'
