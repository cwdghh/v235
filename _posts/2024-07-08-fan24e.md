title: 'DOGE: Domain Reweighting with Generalization Estimation'
openreview: 7rfZ6bMZq4
abstract: The coverage and composition of the pretraining data significantly impacts
  the generalization ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its importance,
  recent LLMs still rely on heuristics and trial and error to increase or reduce the
  influence of data-domains. We propose DOmain reweighting with Generalization Estimation
  (DoGE), which optimizes the probability of sampling from each domain (domain weights)
  in a principled way. Our approach is a two stage process consisting (i) training
  a proxy model to obtain domain weights using a bi-level optimization algorithm;
  (ii) training a larger base model by sampling training domains according to the
  learnt domain weights. In our experiments, we extensively show how DoGE improves
  the generalization of the base model to any target data mixture. On the SlimPajama
  dataset, our base model gets a better perplexity and few-shot reasoning accuracies
  across 6 tasks compared to baseline methods. Moreover, aiming to generalize to out-of-domain
  target tasks, which is unseen in the pretraining corpus (OOD domain), DoGE can effectively
  identify inter-domain dependencies, consistently achieves better test perplexity
  on the target domain.
