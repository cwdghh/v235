title: Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Parameterized Action Spaces
openreview: xW79geE0RA
abstract: We propose a novel model-based reinforcement learning algorithm—Dynamics
  Learning and predictive control with Parameterized Actions (DLPA)—for Parameterized
  Action Markov Decision Processes (PAMDPs). The agent learns a parameterized-action-conditioned
  dynamics model and plans with a modified Model Predictive Path Integral control.
  We theoretically quantify the difference between the generated trajectory and the
  optimal trajectory during planning in terms of the value they achieved through the
  lens of Lipschitz Continuity. Our empirical results on several standard benchmarks
  show that our algorithm achieves superior sample efficiency and asymptotic performance
  than state-of-the-art PAMDP methods.
