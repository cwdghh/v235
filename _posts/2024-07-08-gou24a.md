title: Test-Time Degradation Adaptation for Open-Set Image Restoration
openreview: XLlQb24X2o
abstract: In contrast to close-set scenarios that restore images from a predefined
  set of degradations, open-set image restoration aims to handle the unknown degradations
  that were unforeseen during the pretraining phase, which is less-touched as far
  as we know. This work study this challenging problem and reveal its essence as unidentified
  distribution shifts between the test and training data. Recently, test-time adaptation
  has emerged as a fundamental method to address this inherent disparities. Inspired
  by it, we propose a test-time degradation adaptation framework for open-set image
  restoration, which consists of three components, <em>i.e.</em>, i) a pre-trained
  and degradation-agnostic diffusion model for generating clean images, ii) a test-time
  degradation adapter adapts the unknown degradations based on the input image during
  the testing phase, and iii) the adapter-guided image restoration guides the model
  through the adapter to produce the corresponding clean image. Through experiments
  on multiple degradations, we show that our method achieves comparable even better
  performance than those task-specific methods. The code is available at https://github.com/XLearning-SCU/2024-ICML-TAO.
