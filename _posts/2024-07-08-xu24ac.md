title: A Sparsity Principle for Partially Observable Causal Representation Learning
openreview: MKGrRVODWR
abstract: 'Causal representation learning aims at identifying high-level causal variables
  from perceptual data. Most methods assume that all latent causal variables are captured
  in the high-dimensional observations. We instead consider a partially observed setting,
  in which each measurement only provides information about a subset of the underlying
  causal state. Prior work has studied this setting with multiple domains or views,
  each depending on a fixed subset of latents. Here, we focus on learning from unpaired
  observations from a dataset with an instance-dependent partial observability pattern.
  Our main contribution is to establish two identifiability results for this setting:
  one for linear mixing functions without parametric assumptions on the underlying
  causal model, and one for piecewise linear mixing functions with Gaussian latent
  causal variables. Based on these insights, we propose two methods for estimating
  the underlying causal variables by enforcing sparsity in the inferred representation.
  Experiments on different simulated datasets and established benchmarks highlight
  the effectiveness of our approach in recovering the ground-truth latents.'
