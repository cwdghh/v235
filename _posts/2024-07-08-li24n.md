title: Two-sided Competing Matching Recommendation Markets With Quota and Complementary
  Preferences Constraints
openreview: BajM6YzKvm
abstract: In this paper, we propose a new recommendation algorithm for addressing
  the problem of two-sided online matching markets with complementary preferences
  and quota constraints, where agents’ preferences are unknown a priori and must be
  learned from data. The presence of mixed quota and complementary preferences constraints
  can lead to instability in the matching process, making this problem challenging
  to solve. To overcome this challenge, we formulate the problem as a bandit learning
  framework and propose the Multi-agent Multi-type Thompson Sampling (MMTS) algorithm.
  The algorithm combines the strengths of Thompson Sampling for exploration with a
  new double matching technique to provide a stable matching outcome. Our theoretical
  analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of MMTS as it can achieve stability and
  has a total $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(Q{\sqrt{K_{\max}T}})$-Bayesian regret with
  high probability, which exhibits linearity with respect to the total firm’s quota
  $Q$, the square root of the maximum size of available type workers $\sqrt{K_{\max}}$
  and time horizon $T$. In addition, simulation studies also demonstrate MMTS’ effectiveness
  in various settings. We provide code used in our experiments https://github.com/Likelyt/Double-Matching.
