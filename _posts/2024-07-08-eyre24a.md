title: 'Out of the Ordinary: Spectrally Adapting Regression for Covariate Shift'
openreview: H3bATm4mKn
abstract: Designing deep neural network classifiers that perform robustly on distributions
  differing from the available training data is an active area of machine learning
  research. However, out-of-distribution generalization for regression—the analogous
  problem for modeling continuous targets—remains relatively unexplored. To tackle
  this problem, we return to first principles and analyze how the closed-form solution
  for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression is sensitive to covariate shift. We
  characterize the out-of-distribution risk of the OLS model in terms of the eigenspectrum
  decomposition of the source and target data. We then use this insight to propose
  a method called Spectral Adapted Regressor (SpAR) for adapting the weights of the
  last layer of a pre-trained neural regression model to perform better on input data
  originating from a different distribution. We demonstrate how this lightweight spectral
  adaptation procedure can improve out-of-distribution performance for synthetic and
  real-world datasets.
