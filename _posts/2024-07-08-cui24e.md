title: Ameliorate Spurious Correlations in Dataset Condensation
openreview: RbnojVv4HK
abstract: Dataset Condensation has emerged as a technique for compressing large datasets
  into smaller synthetic counterparts, facilitating downstream training tasks. In
  this paper, we study the impact of bias inside the original dataset on the performance
  of dataset condensation. With a comprehensive empirical evaluation on canonical
  datasets with color, corruption and background biases, we found that color and background
  biases in the original dataset will be amplified through the condensation process,
  resulting in a notable decline in the performance of models trained on the condensed
  dataset, while corruption bias is suppressed through the condensation process. To
  reduce bias amplification in dataset condensation, we introduce a simple yet highly
  effective approach based on a sample reweighting scheme utilizing kernel density
  estimation. Empirical results on multiple real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the proposed method. Notably, on CMNIST with 5% bias-conflict
  ratio and IPC 50, our method achieves 91.5% test accuracy compared to 23.8% from
  vanilla DM, boosting the performance by 67.7%, whereas applying state-of-the-art
  debiasing method on the same dataset only achieves 53.7% accuracy. Our findings
  highlight the importance of addressing biases in dataset condensation and provide
  a promising avenue to address bias amplification in the process.
