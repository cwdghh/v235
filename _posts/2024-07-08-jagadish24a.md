title: Human-like Category Learning by Injecting Ecological Priors from Large Language
  Models into Neural Networks
openreview: oTmQmaNkGn
abstract: 'Ecological rationality refers to the notion that humans are rational agents
  adapted to their environment. However, testing this theory remains challenging due
  to two reasons: the difficulty in defining what tasks are ecologically valid and
  building rational models for these tasks. In this work, we demonstrate that large
  language models can generate cognitive tasks, specifically category learning tasks,
  that match the statistics of real-world tasks, thereby addressing the first challenge.
  We tackle the second challenge by deriving rational agents adapted to these tasks
  using the framework of meta-learning, leading to a class of models called <em>ecologically
  rational meta-learned inference</em> (ERMI). ERMI quantitatively explains human
  data better than seven other cognitive models in two different experiments. It additionally
  matches human behavior on a qualitative level: (1) it finds the same tasks difficult
  that humans find difficult, (2) it becomes more reliant on an exemplar-based strategy
  for assigning categories with learning, and (3) it generalizes to unseen stimuli
  in a human-like way. Furthermore, we show that ERMIâ€™s ecologically valid priors
  allow it to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the OpenML-CC18 classification
  benchmark.'
