title: 'Position: A Call to Action for a Human-Centered AutoML Paradigm'
openreview: wELbEYgnmo
abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) was formed around the fundamental objectives
  of automatically and efficiently configuring machine learning (ML) workflows, aiding
  the research of new ML algorithms, and contributing to the democratization of ML
  by making it accessible to a broader audience. Over the past decade, commendable
  achievements in AutoML have primarily focused on optimizing predictive performance.
  This focused progress, while substantial, raises questions about how well AutoML
  has met its broader, original goals. In this position paper, we argue that a key
  to unlocking AutoMLâ€™s full potential lies in addressing the currently underexplored
  aspect of user interaction with AutoML systems, including their diverse roles, expectations,
  and expertise. We envision a more human-centered approach in future AutoML research,
  promoting the collaborative design of ML systems that tightly integrates the complementary
  strengths of human expertise and AutoML methodologies.
