title: 'Consistent Diffusion Meets Tweedie: Training Exact Ambient Diffusion Models
  with Noisy Data'
openreview: PlVjIGaFdH
abstract: Ambient diffusion is a recently proposed framework for training diffusion
  models using corrupted data. Both Ambient Diffusion and alternative SURE-based approaches
  for learning diffusion models from corrupted data resort to approximations which
  deteriorate performance. We present the first framework for training diffusion models
  that provably sample from the uncorrupted distribution given only noisy training
  data, solving an open problem in Ambient diffusion. Our key technical contribution
  is a method that uses a double application of Tweedieâ€™s formula and a consistency
  loss function that allows us to extend sampling at noise levels below the observed
  data noise. We also provide further evidence that diffusion models memorize from
  their training sets by identifying extremely corrupted images that are almost perfectly
  reconstructed, raising copyright and privacy concerns. Our method for training using
  corrupted samples can be used to mitigate this problem. We demonstrate this by fine-tuning
  Stable Diffusion XL to generate samples from a distribution using only noisy samples.
  Our framework reduces the amount of memorization of the fine-tuning dataset, while
  maintaining competitive performance.
