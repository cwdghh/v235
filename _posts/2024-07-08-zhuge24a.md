title: 'GPTSwarm: Language Agents as Optimizable Graphs'
openreview: uTC9AFXIhg
abstract: Various human-designed prompt engineering techniques have been proposed
  to improve problem solvers based on Large Language Models (LLMs), yielding many
  disparate code bases. We unify these approaches by describing LLM-based agents as
  computational graphs. The nodes implement functions to process multimodal data or
  query LLMs, and the edges describe the information flow between operations. Graphs
  can be recursively combined into larger composite graphs representing hierarchies
  of inter-agent collaboration (where edges connect operations of different agents).
  Our novel automatic graph optimizers (1) refine node-level LLM prompts (node optimization)
  and (2) improve agent orchestration by changing graph connectivity (edge optimization).
  Experiments demonstrate that our framework can be used to efficiently develop, integrate,
  and automatically improve various LLM agents. Our code is public.
