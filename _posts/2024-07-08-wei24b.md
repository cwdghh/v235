title: Learning Pseudo-Contractive Denoisers for Inverse Problems
openreview: G0vZ5ENrJQ
abstract: Deep denoisers have shown excellent performance in solving inverse problems
  in signal and image processing. In order to guarantee the convergence, the denoiser
  needs to satisfy some Lipschitz conditions like non-expansiveness. However, enforcing
  such constraints inevitably compromises recovery performance. This paper introduces
  a novel training strategy that enforces a weaker constraint on the deep denoiser
  called pseudo-contractiveness. By studying the spectrum of the Jacobian matrix,
  relationships between different denoiser assumptions are revealed. Effective algorithms
  based on gradient descent and Ishikawa process are derived, and further assumptions
  of strict pseudo-contractiveness yield efficient algorithms using half-quadratic
  splitting and forward-backward splitting. The proposed algorithms theoretically
  converge strongly to a fixed point. A training strategy based on holomorphic transformation
  and functional calculi is proposed to enforce the pseudo-contractive denoiser assumption.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance of the pseudo-contractive
  denoiser compared to related denoisers. The proposed methods are competitive in
  terms of visual effects and quantitative values.
