title: Unsupervised Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning via Functional Reward Encodings
openreview: a6wCNfIj8E
abstract: Can we pre-train a generalist agent from a large amount of unlabeled offline
  trajectories such that it can be immediately adapted to any new downstream tasks
  in a zero-shot manner? In this work, we present a <em>functional</em> reward encoding
  (FRE) as a general, scalable solution to this <em>zero-shot RL</em> problem. Our
  main idea is to learn functional representations of any arbitrary tasks by encoding
  their state-reward samples using a transformer-based variational auto-encoder. This
  functional encoding not only enables the pre-training of an agent from a wide diversity
  of general unsupervised reward functions, but also provides a way to solve any new
  downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner, given a small number of reward-annotated
  samples. We empirically show that FRE agents trained on diverse random unsupervised
  reward functions can generalize to solve novel tasks in a range of simulated robotic
  benchmarks, often outperforming previous zero-shot RL and offline RL methods.
