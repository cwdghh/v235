title: Reweighted Solutions for Weighted Low Rank Approximation
openreview: r9XICONppE
abstract: Weighted low rank approximation (WLRA) is an important yet computationally
  challenging primitive with applications ranging from statistical analysis, model
  compression, and signal processing. To cope with the NP-hardness of this problem,
  prior work considers heuristics, bicriteria, or parameterized tractable algorithms
  to solve this problem. In this work, we introduce a new relaxed solution to WLRA
  which outputs a matrix that is not necessarily low rank, but can be stored using
  very few parameters and gives provable approximation guarantees when the weight
  matrix has low rank. Our central idea is to use the weight matrix itself to reweight
  a low rank solution, which gives an extremely simple algorithm with remarkable empirical
  performance in applications to model compression and on synthetic datasets. Our
  algorithm also gives nearly optimal communication complexity bounds for a natural
  distributed problem associated with this problem, for which we show matching communication
  lower bounds. Together, our communication complexity bounds show that the rank of
  the weight matrix provably parameterizes the communication complexity of WLRA. We
  also obtain the first relative error guarantees for feature selection with a weighted
  objective.
