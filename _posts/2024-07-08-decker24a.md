title: Provably Better Explanations with Optimized Aggregation of Feature Attributions
openreview: 3VnSgdget6
abstract: Using feature attributions for post-hoc explanations is a common practice
  to understand and verify the predictions of opaque machine learning models. Despite
  the numerous techniques available, individual methods often produce inconsistent
  and unstable results, putting their overall reliability into question. In this work,
  we aim to systematically improve the quality of feature attributions by combining
  multiple explanations across distinct methods or their variations. For this purpose,
  we propose a novel approach to derive optimal convex combinations of feature attributions
  that yield provable improvements of desired quality criteria such as robustness
  or faithfulness to the model behavior. Through extensive experiments involving various
  model architectures and popular feature attribution techniques, we demonstrate that
  our combination strategy consistently outperforms individual methods and existing
  baselines.
