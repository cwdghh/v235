title: 'Learning the Uncertainty Sets of Linear Control Systems via Set Membership:
  A Non-asymptotic Analysis'
openreview: n2kq2EOHFE
abstract: This paper studies uncertainty set estimation for unknown linear systems.
  Uncertainty sets are crucial for the quality of robust control since they directly
  influence the conservativeness of the control design. Departing from the confidence
  region analysis of least squares estimation, this paper focuses on set membership
  estimation (SME). Though good numerical performances have attracted applications
  of SME in the control literature, the non-asymptotic convergence rate of SME for
  linear systems remains an open question. This paper provides the first convergence
  rate bounds for SME and discusses variations of SME under relaxed assumptions. We
  also provide numerical results demonstrating SMEâ€™s practical promise.
