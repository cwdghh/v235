title: Instruction Tuning for Secure Code Generation
openreview: MgTzMaYHvG
abstract: 'Modern language models (LMs) have gained widespread acceptance in everyday
  and professional contexts, particularly in programming. An essential procedure enabling
  this adoption is instruction tuning, which substantially enhances LMsâ€™ practical
  utility by training them to follow user instructions and human preferences. However,
  existing instruction tuning schemes overlook a crucial aspect: the security of generated
  code. As a result, even the state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LMs frequently produce
  unsafe code, posing significant security risks. In this work, we introduce SafeCoder
  to address this gap. SafeCoder performs security-centric fine-tuning using a diverse
  and high-quality dataset that we collected using an automated pipeline. We integrate
  the security fine-tuning with standard instruction tuning, to facilitate a joint
  optimization of both security and utility. Despite its simplicity, we show that
  SafeCoder is effective across a variety of popular LMs and datasets. It is able
  to drastically improve security (by about 30%), while preserving utility.'
