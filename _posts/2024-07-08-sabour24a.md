title: 'Align Your Steps: Optimizing Sampling Schedules in Diffusion Models'
openreview: nBGBzV4It3
abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have established themselves as the state-of-the-art
  generative modeling approach in the visual domain and beyond. A crucial drawback
  of DMs is their slow sampling speed, relying on many sequential function evaluations
  through large neural networks. Sampling from DMs can be seen as solving a differential
  equation through a discretized set of noise levels known as the sampling schedule.
  While past works primarily focused on deriving efficient solvers, little attention
  has been given to finding optimal sampling schedules, and the entire literature
  relies on hand-crafted heuristics. In this work, for the first time, we propose
  a general and principled approach to optimizing the sampling schedules of DMs for
  high-quality outputs, called Align Your Steps. We leverage methods from stochastic
  calculus and find optimal schedules specific to different solvers, trained DMs and
  datasets. We evaluate our novel approach on several image, video as well as 2D toy
  data synthesis benchmarks, using a variety of different samplers, and observe that
  our optimized schedules outperform previous hand-crafted schedules in almost all
  experiments. Our method demonstrates the untapped potential of sampling schedule
  optimization, especially in the few-step synthesis regime.
