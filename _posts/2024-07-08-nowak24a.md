title: 'Sparser, Better, Deeper, Stronger: Improving Static Sparse Training with Exact
  Orthogonal Initialization'
openreview: svm53KQAtN
abstract: Static sparse training aims to train sparse models from scratch, achieving
  remarkable results in recent years. A key design choice is given by the sparse initialization,
  which determines the trainable sub-network through a binary mask. Existing methods
  mainly select such mask based on a predefined dense initialization. Such an approach
  may not efficiently leverage the mask’s potential impact on the optimization. An
  alternative direction, inspired by research into dynamical isometry, is to introduce
  orthogonality in the sparse subnetwork, which helps in stabilizing the gradient
  signal. In this work, we propose Exact Orthogonal Initialization (EOI), a novel
  sparse orthogonal initialization scheme based on composing random Givens rotations.
  Contrary to other existing approaches, our method provides exact (not approximated)
  orthogonality and enables the creation of layers with arbitrary densities. We demonstrate
  the superior effectiveness and efficiency of EOI through experiments, consistently
  outperforming common sparse initialization techniques. Our method enables training
  highly sparse 1000-layer MLP and CNN networks without residual connections or normalization
  techniques, emphasizing the crucial role of weight initialization in static sparse
  training alongside sparse mask selection.
