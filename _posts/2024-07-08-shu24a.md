title: Effects of Exponential Gaussian Distribution on (Double Sampling) Randomized
  Smoothing
openreview: IxZ4xaHSYG
abstract: Randomized Smoothing (RS) is currently a scalable certified defense method
  providing robustness certification against adversarial examples. Although significant
  progress has been achieved in providing defenses against $\ell_p$ adversaries, the
  interaction between the smoothing distribution and the robustness certification
  still remains vague. In this work, we comprehensively study the effect of two families
  of distributions, named Exponential Standard Gaussian (ESG) and Exponential General
  Gaussian (EGG) distributions, on Randomized Smoothing and Double Sampling Randomized
  Smoothing (DSRS). We derive an analytic formula for ESGâ€™s certified radius, which
  converges to the origin formula of RS as the dimension $d$ increases. Additionally,
  we prove that EGG can provide tighter constant factors than DSRS in providing $\Omega(\sqrt{d})$
  lower bounds of $\ell_2$ certified radius, and thus further addresses the curse
  of dimensionality in RS. Our experiments on real-world datasets confirm our theoretical
  analysis of the ESG distributions, that they provide almost the same certification
  under different exponents $\eta$ for both RS and DSRS. In addition, EGG brings a
  significant improvement to the DSRS certification, but the mechanism can be different
  when the classifier properties are different. Compared to the primitive DSRS, the
  increase in certified accuracy provided by EGG is prominent, up to 6.4% on ImageNet.
