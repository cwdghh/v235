title: Energy-Guided Diffusion Sampling for Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning
openreview: hunSEjeCPE
abstract: Combining offline and online reinforcement learning (RL) techniques is indeed
  crucial for achieving efficient and safe learning where data acquisition is expensive.
  Existing methods replay offline data directly in the online phase, resulting in
  a significant challenge of data distribution shift and subsequently causing inefficiency
  in online fine-tuning. To address this issue, we introduce an innovative approach,
  <b>E</b>nergy-guided <b>DI</b>ffusion <b>S</b>ampling (EDIS), which utilizes a diffusion
  model to extract prior knowledge from the offline dataset and employs energy functions
  to distill this knowledge for enhanced data generation in the online phase. The
  theoretical analysis demonstrates that EDIS exhibits reduced suboptimality compared
  to solely utilizing online data or directly reusing offline data. EDIS is a plug-in
  approach and can be combined with existing methods in offline-to-online RL setting.
  By implementing EDIS to off-the-shelf methods Cal-QL and IQL, we observe a notable
  20% average improvement in empirical performance on MuJoCo, AntMaze, and Adroit
  environments. Code is available at https://github.com/liuxhym/EDIS.
