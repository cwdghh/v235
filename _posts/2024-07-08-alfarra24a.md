title: Evaluation of Test-Time Adaptation Under Computational Time Constraints
openreview: 6FtAXU4ean
abstract: This paper proposes a novel online evaluation protocol for Test Time Adaptation
  (TTA) methods, which penalizes slower methods by providing them with fewer samples
  for adaptation. TTA methods leverage unlabeled data at test time to adapt to distribution
  shifts. Though many effective methods have been proposed, their impressive performance
  usually comes at the cost of significantly increased computation budgets. Current
  evaluation protocols overlook the effect of this extra computation cost, affecting
  their real-world applicability. To address this issue, we propose a more realistic
  evaluation protocol for TTA methods, where data is received in an online fashion
  from a constant-speed data stream, thereby accounting for the method’s adaptation
  speed. We apply our proposed protocol to benchmark several TTA methods on multiple
  datasets and scenarios. Extensive experiments shows that, when accounting for inference
  speed, simple and fast approaches can outperform more sophisticated but slower methods.
  For example, SHOT from 2020, outperforms the state-of-the-art method SAR from 2023
  under our online setting. Our results reveal the importance of developing practical
  TTA methods that are both accurate and efficient.
