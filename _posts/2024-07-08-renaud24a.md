title: Plug-and-Play image restoration with Stochastic deNOising REgularization
openreview: byAXJTk0LH
abstract: Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithms are a class of iterative algorithms that
  address image inverse problems by combining a physical model and a deep neural network
  for regularization. Even if they produce impressive image restoration results, these
  algorithms rely on a non-standard use of a denoiser on images that are less and
  less noisy along the iterations, which contrasts with recent algorithms based on
  Diffusion Models (DM), where the denoiser is applied only on re-noised images. We
  propose a new PnP framework, called Stochastic deNOising REgularization (SNORE),
  which applies the denoiser only on images with noise of the adequate level. It is
  based on an explicit stochastic regularization, which leads to a stochastic gradient
  descent algorithm to solve ill-posed inverse problems. A convergence analysis of
  this algorithm and its annealing extension is provided. Experimentally, we prove
  that SNORE is competitive with respect to state-of-the-art methods on deblurring
  and inpainting tasks, both quantitatively and qualitatively.
