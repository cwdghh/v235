title: 'Momentum for the Win: Collaborative Federated Reinforcement Learning across
  Heterogeneous Environments'
openreview: g43yUNWX4V
abstract: 'We explore a Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) problem where $N$ agents
  collaboratively learn a common policy without sharing their trajectory data. To
  date, existing FRL work has primarily focused on agents operating in the same or
  â€œsimilar" environments. In contrast, our problem setup allows for arbitrarily large
  levels of environment heterogeneity. To obtain the optimal policy which maximizes
  the average performance across all <em>potentially completely different</em> environments,
  we propose two algorithms: FedSVRPG-M and FedHAPG-M. In contrast to existing results,
  we demonstrate that both FedSVRPG-M and FedHAPG-M, both of which leverage momentum
  mechanisms, can exactly converge to a stationary point of the average performance
  function, regardless of the magnitude of environment heterogeneity. Furthermore,
  by incorporating the benefits of variance-reduction techniques or Hessian approximation,
  both algorithms achieve state-of-the-art convergence results, characterized by a
  sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}\left(\epsilon^{-\frac{3}{2}}/N\right)$. Notably,
  our algorithms enjoy linear convergence speedups with respect to the number of agents,
  highlighting the benefit of collaboration among agents in finding a common policy.'
