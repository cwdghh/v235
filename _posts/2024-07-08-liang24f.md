title: Efficient Precision and Recall Metrics for Assessing Generative Models using
  Hubness-aware Sampling
openreview: jnps5YwNlU
abstract: 'Despite impressive results, deep generative models require massive datasets
  for training, and as dataset size increases, effective evaluation metrics like precision
  and recall (P&R) become computationally infeasible on commodity hardware. In this
  paper, we address this challenge by proposing efficient P&R (eP&R) metrics that
  give almost identical results as the original P&R but with much lower computational
  costs. Specifically, we identify two redundancies in the original P&R: i) redundancy
  in ratio computation and ii) redundancy in manifold inside/outside identification.
  We find both can be effectively removed via hubness-aware sampling, which extracts
  representative elements from synthetic/real image samples based on their hubness
  values, i.e., the number of times a sample becomes a k-nearest neighbor to others
  in the feature space. Thanks to the insensitivity of hubness-aware sampling to exact
  k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) results, we further improve the efficiency of our eP&R
  metrics by using approximate k-NN methods. Extensive experiments show that our eP&R
  matches the original P&R but is far more efficient in time and space. Our code is
