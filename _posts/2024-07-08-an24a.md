title: 'WAVES: Benchmarking the Robustness of Image Watermarks'
openreview: URtUYfC3GA
abstract: 'In the burgeoning age of generative AI, watermarks act as identifiers of
  provenance and artificial content. We present WAVES (Watermark Analysis via Enhanced
  Stress-testing), a benchmark for assessing image watermark robustness, overcoming
  the limitations of current evaluation methods. WAVES integrates detection and identification
  tasks and establishes a standardized evaluation protocol comprised of a diverse
  range of stress tests. The attacks in WAVES range from traditional image distortions
  to advanced, novel variations of diffusive, and adversarial attacks. Our evaluation
  examines two pivotal dimensions: the degree of image quality degradation and the
  efficacy of watermark detection after attacks. Our novel, comprehensive evaluation
  reveals previously undetected vulnerabilities of several modern watermarking algorithms.
  We envision WAVES as a toolkit for the future development of robust watermarks.'
