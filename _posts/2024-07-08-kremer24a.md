title: Geometry-Aware Instrumental Variable Regression
openreview: 6KLNiRdWH6
abstract: Instrumental variable (IV) regression can be approached through its formulation
  in terms of conditional moment restrictions (CMR). Building on variants of the generalized
  method of moments, most CMR estimators are implicitly based on approximating the
  population data distribution via reweightings of the empirical sample. While for
  large sample sizes, in the independent identically distributed (IID) setting, reweightings
  can provide sufficient flexibility, they might fail to capture the relevant information
  in presence of corrupted data or data prone to adversarial attacks. To address these
  shortcomings, we propose the Sinkhorn Method of Moments, an optimal transport-based
  IV estimator that takes into account the geometry of the data manifold through data-derivative
  information. We provide a simple plug-and-play implementation of our method that
  performs on par with related estimators in standard settings but improves robustness
  against data corruption and adversarial attacks.
