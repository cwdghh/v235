title: Efficient Adaptation in Mixed-Motive Environments via Hierarchical Opponent
  Modeling and Planning
openreview: disVlUOH4b
abstract: 'Despite the recent successes of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
  algorithms, efficiently adapting to co-players in mixed-motive environments remains
  a significant challenge. One feasible approach is to hierarchically model co-players’
  behavior based on inferring their characteristics. However, these methods often
  encounter difficulties in efficient reasoning and utilization of inferred information.
  To address these issues, we propose Hierarchical Opponent modeling and Planning
  (HOP), a novel multi-agent decision-making algorithm that enables few-shot adaptation
  to unseen policies in mixed-motive environments. HOP is hierarchically composed
  of two modules: an opponent modeling module that infers others’ goals and learns
  corresponding goal-conditioned policies, and a planning module that employs Monte
  Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to identify the best response. Our approach improves efficiency
  by updating beliefs about others’ goals both across and within episodes and by using
  information from the opponent modeling module to guide planning. Experimental results
  demonstrate that in mixed-motive environments, HOP exhibits superior few-shot adaptation
  capabilities when interacting with various unseen agents, and excels in self-play
  scenarios. Furthermore, the emergence of social intelligence during our experiments
  underscores the potential of our approach in complex multi-agent environments.'
