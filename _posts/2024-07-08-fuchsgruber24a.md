title: Uncertainty for Active Learning on Graphs
openreview: BCEtumPYDt
abstract: 'Uncertainty Sampling is an Active Learning strategy that aims to improve
  the data efficiency of machine learning models by iteratively acquiring labels of
  data points with the highest uncertainty. While it has proven effective for independent
  data its applicability to graphs remains under-explored. We propose the first extensive
  study of Uncertainty Sampling for node classification: <b>(1)</b> We benchmark Uncertainty
  Sampling beyond predictive uncertainty and highlight a significant performance gap
  to other Active Learning strategies. <b>(2)</b> We develop ground-truth Bayesian
  uncertainty estimates in terms of the data generating process and prove their effectiveness
  in guiding Uncertainty Sampling toward optimal queries. We confirm our results on
  synthetic data and design an approximate approach that consistently outperforms
  other uncertainty estimators on real datasets. <b>(3)</b> Based on this analysis,
  we relate pitfalls in modeling uncertainty to existing methods. Our analysis enables
  and informs the development of principled uncertainty estimation on graphs.'
