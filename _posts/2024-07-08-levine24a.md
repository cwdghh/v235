title: 'Cell2Sentence: Teaching Large Language Models the Language of Biology'
openreview: EWt5wsEdvc
abstract: We introduce Cell2Sentence (C2S), a novel method to directly adapt large
  language models to a biological context, specifically single-cell transcriptomics.
  By transforming gene expression data into "cell sentences," C2S bridges the gap
  between natural language processing and biology. We demonstrate cell sentences enable
  the fine-tuning of language models for diverse tasks in biology, including cell
  generation, complex cell-type annotation, and direct data-driven text generation.
  Our experiments reveal that GPT-2, when fine-tuned with C2S, can generate biologically
  valid cells based on cell type inputs, and accurately predict cell types from cell
  sentences. This illustrates that language models, through C2S fine-tuning, can acquire
  a significant understanding of single-cell biology while maintaining robust text
  generation capabilities. C2S offers a flexible, accessible framework to integrate
  natural language processing with transcriptomics, utilizing existing models and
  libraries for a wide range of biological applications.
