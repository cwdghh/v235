title: Revealing the Dark Secrets of Extremely Large Kernel ConvNets on Robustness
openreview: rkYOxLLv2x
abstract: 'Robustness is a vital aspect to consider when deploying deep learning models
  into the wild. Numerous studies have been dedicated to the study of the robustness
  of vision transformers (ViTs), which have dominated as the mainstream backbone choice
  for vision tasks since the dawn of 2020s. Recently, some large kernel convnets make
  a comeback with impressive performance and efficiency. However, it still remains
  unclear whether large kernel networks are robust and the attribution of their robustness.
  In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive evaluation of large kernel convnets’
  robustness and their differences from typical small kernel counterparts and ViTs
  on six diverse robustness benchmark datasets. Then to analyze the underlying factors
  behind their strong robustness, we design experiments from both quantitative and
  qualitative perspectives to reveal large kernel convnets’ intriguing properties
  that are completely different from typical convnets. Our experiments demonstrate
  for the first time that pure CNNs can achieve exceptional robustness comparable
  or even superior to that of ViTs. Our analysis on occlusion invariance, kernel attention
  patterns and frequency characteristics provide novel insights into the source of
  robustness. Code available at: https://github.com/Lauch1ng/LKRobust.'
