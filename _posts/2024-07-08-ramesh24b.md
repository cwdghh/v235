title: Sequence Compression Speeds Up Credit Assignment in Reinforcement Learning
openreview: NlM4gp8hyO
abstract: Temporal credit assignment in reinforcement learning is challenging due
  to delayed and stochastic outcomes. Monte Carlo targets can bridge long delays between
  action and consequence but lead to high-variance targets due to stochasticity. Temporal
  difference (TD) learning uses bootstrapping to overcome variance but introduces
  a bias that can only be corrected through many iterations. TD($\lambda$) provides
  a mechanism to navigate this bias-variance tradeoff smoothly. Appropriately selecting
  $\lambda$ can significantly improve performance. Here, we propose Chunked-TD, which
  uses predicted probabilities of transitions from a model for computing $\lambda$-return
  targets. Unlike other model-based solutions to credit assignment, Chunked-TD is
  less vulnerable to model inaccuracies. Our approach is motivated by the principle
  of history compression and ‘chunks’ trajectories for conventional TD learning. Chunking
  with learned world models compresses near-deterministic regions of the environment-policy
  interaction to speed up credit assignment while still bootstrapping when necessary.
  We propose algorithms that can be implemented online and show that they solve some
  problems much faster than conventional TD($\lambda$).
