title: Estimating Unknown Population Sizes Using the Hypergeometric Distribution
openreview: qE4nkfyMYl
abstract: The multivariate hypergeometric distribution describes sampling without
  replacement from a discrete population of elements divided into multiple categories.
  Addressing a gap in the literature, we tackle the challenge of estimating discrete
  distributions when both the total population size and the category sizes are unknown.
  Here, we propose a novel solution using the hypergeometric likelihood to solve this
  estimation problem, even in the presence of severe under-sampling. Our approach
  accounts for a data generating process where the ground-truth is a mixture of distributions
  conditional on a continuous latent variable, as seen in collaborative filtering,
  using the variational autoencoder framework. Empirical data simulation demonstrates
  that our method outperforms other likelihood functions used to model count data,
  both in terms of accuracy of population size estimate and learning an informative
  latent space. We showcase our methodâ€™s versatility through applications in NLP,
  by inferring and estimating the complexity of latent vocabularies in reading passage
  excerpts, and in biology, by accurately recovering the true number of gene transcripts
  from sparse single-cell genomics data.
