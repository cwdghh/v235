title: Nonparametric Teaching of Implicit Neural Representations
openreview: 1PMkV6oKw3
abstract: We investigate the learning of implicit neural representation (INR) using
  an overparameterized multilayer perceptron (MLP) via a novel nonparametric teaching
  perspective. The latter offers an efficient example selection framework for teaching
  nonparametrically defined (viz. non-closed-form) target functions, such as image
  functions defined by 2D grids of pixels. To address the costly training of INRs,
  we propose a paradigm called Implicit Neural Teaching (INT) that treats INR learning
  as a nonparametric teaching problem, where the given signal being fitted serves
  as the target function. The teacher then selects signal fragments for iterative
  training of the MLP to achieve fast convergence. By establishing a connection between
  MLP evolution through parameter-based gradient descent and that of function evolution
  through functional gradient descent in nonparametric teaching, we show <em>for the
  first time</em> that teaching an overparameterized MLP is consistent with teaching
  a nonparametric learner. This new discovery readily permits a convenient drop-in
  of nonparametric teaching algorithms to broadly enhance INR training efficiency,
  demonstrating 30%+ training time savings across various input modalities.
