title: Evolution-Inspired Loss Functions for Protein Representation Learning
openreview: y5L8W0KRUX
abstract: 'AI-based frameworks for protein engineering use self-supervised learning
  (SSL) to obtain representations for downstream mutation effect predictions. The
  most common training objective for these methods is wildtype accuracy: given a sequence
  or structure where a wildtype residue has been masked, predict the missing amino
  acid. Wildtype accuracy, however, does not align with the primary goal of protein
  engineering, which is to suggest a mutation rather than to identify what already
  appears in nature. Here we present Evolutionary Ranking (EvoRank), a training objective
  that incorporates evolutionary information derived from multiple sequence alignments
  (MSAs) to learn more diverse protein representations. EvoRank corresponds to ranking
  amino-acid likelihoods in the probability distribution induced by an MSA. This objective
  forces models to learn the underlying evolutionary dynamics of a protein. Across
  a variety of phenotypes and datasets, we demonstrate that EvoRank leads to dramatic
  improvements in zero-shot performance and can compete with models fine-tuned on
  experimental data. This is particularly important in protein engineering, where
  it is expensive to obtain data for fine-tuning.'
