title: Privately Learning Smooth Distributions on the Hypercube by Projections
openreview: NeEbsvnaWE
abstract: 'Fueled by the ever-increasing need for statistics that guarantee the privacy
  of their training sets, this article studies the centrally-private estimation of
  Sobolev-smooth densities of probability over the hypercube in dimension d. The contributions
  of this article are two-fold : Firstly, it generalizes the one-dimensional results
  of (Lalanne et al., 2023) to non-integer levels of smoothness and to a high-dimensional
  setting, which is important for two reasons : it is more suited for modern learning
  tasks, and it allows understanding the relations between privacy, dimensionality
  and smoothness, which is a central question with differential privacy. Secondly,
  this article presents a private strategy of estimation that is data-driven (usually
  referred to as adaptive in Statistics) in order to privately choose an estimator
  that achieves a good bias-variance trade-off among a finite family of private projection
  estimators without prior knowledge of the ground-truth smoothness β. This is achieved
  by adapting the Lepskii method for private selection, by adding a new penalization
  term that makes the estimation privacy-aware.'
