title: Dirichlet Flow Matching with Applications to DNA Sequence Design
openreview: syXFAVqx85
abstract: Discrete diffusion or flow models could enable faster and more controllable
  sequence generation than autoregressive models. We show that naive linear flow matching
  on the simplex is insufficient toward this goal since it suffers from discontinuities
  in the training target and further pathologies. To overcome this, we develop Dirichlet
  flow matching on the simplex based on mixtures of Dirichlet distributions as probability
  paths. In this framework, we derive a connection between the mixtures’ scores and
  the flow’s vector field that allows for classifier and classifier-free guidance.
  Further, we provide distilled Dirichlet flow matching, which enables one-step sequence
  generation with minimal performance hits, resulting in $O(L)$ speedups compared
  to autoregressive models. On complex DNA sequence generation tasks, we demonstrate
  superior performance compared to all baselines in distributional metrics and in
  achieving desired design targets for generated sequences. Finally, we show that
  our classifier-free guidance approach improves unconditional generation and is effective
  for generating DNA that satisfies design targets.
