title: Differentiability and Optimization of Multiparameter Persistent Homology
openreview: ixdfvnO0uy
abstract: 'Real-valued functions on geometric data—such as node attributes on a graph—can
  be optimized using descriptors from persistent homology, allowing the user to incorporate
  topological terms in the loss function. When optimizing a single real-valued function
  (the one-parameter setting), there is a canonical choice of descriptor for persistent
  homology: the barcode. The operation mapping a real-valued function to its barcode
  is differentiable almost everywhere, and the convergence of gradient descent for
  losses using barcodes is relatively well understood. When optimizing a vector-valued
  function (the multiparameter setting), there is no unique choice of descriptor for
  multiparameter persistent homology, and many distinct descriptors have been proposed.
  This calls for the development of a general framework for differentiability and
  optimization that applies to a wide range of multiparameter homological descriptors.
  In this article, we develop such a framework and show that it encompasses well-known
  descriptors of different flavors, such as signed barcodes and the multiparameter
  persistence landscape. We complement the theory with numerical experiments supporting
  the idea that optimizing multiparameter homological descriptors can lead to improved
  performances compared to optimizing one-parameter descriptors, even when using the
  simplest and most efficiently computable multiparameter descriptors.'
