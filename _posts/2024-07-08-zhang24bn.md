title: 'GroupCover: A Secure, Efficient and Scalable Inference Framework for On-device
  Model Protection based on TEEs'
openreview: 4mU6LNMaIu
abstract: Due to the high cost of training DNN models, how to protect the intellectual
  property of DNN models, especially when the models are deployed to usersâ€™ devices,
  is becoming an important topic. One practical solution is to use Trusted Execution
  Environments (TEEs) and researchers have proposed various model obfuscation solutions
  to make full use of the high-security guarantee of TEEs and the high performance
  of collocated GPUs. In this paper, we first identify a common vulnerability, namely
  the fragility of randomness, that is shared by existing TEE-based model obfuscation
  solutions. This vulnerability benefits model-stealing attacks and allows the adversary
  to recover about 97% of the secret model. To improve the security of TEE-shielded
  DNN models, we further propose a new model obfuscation approach GroupCover, which
  uses sufficient randomization and mutual covering obfuscation to protect model weights.
  Experimental results demonstrate that GroupCover can achieve a comparable security
  level as the upper-bound (black-box protection), which is remarkably over 3x compared
  with existing solutions. Besides, GroupCover introduces 19% overhead and negligible
  accuracy loss compared to model unprotected scheme.
