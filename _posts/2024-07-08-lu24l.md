title: Probabilistic Routing for Graph-Based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search
openreview: pz4B2kHVKo
abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) in high-dimensional spaces is
  a pivotal challenge in the field of machine learning. In recent years graph-based
  methods have emerged as the superior approach to ANNS, establishing a new state
  of the art. Although various optimizations for graph-based ANNS have been introduced,
  they predominantly rely on heuristic methods that lack formal theoretical backing.
  This paper aims to enhance routing within graph-based ANNS by introducing a method
  that offers a probabilistic guarantee when exploring a nodeâ€™s neighbors in the graph.
  We formulate the problem as probabilistic routing and develop two baseline strategies
  by incorporating locality-sensitive techniques. Subsequently, we introduce PEOs,
  a novel approach that efficiently identifies which neighbors in the graph should
  be considered for exact distance computation, thus significantly improving efficiency
  in practice. Our experiments demonstrate that equipping PEOs can increase throughput
  on a commonly utilized graph index (HNSW) by a factor of 1.6 to 2.5, and its efficiency
  consistently outperforms the leading-edge routing technique by 1.1 to 1.4 times.
