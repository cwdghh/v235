title: 'Position: Categorical Deep Learning is an Algebraic Theory of All Architectures'
openreview: EIcxV7T0Sy
abstract: We present our position on the elusive quest for a general-purpose framework
  for specifying and studying deep learning architectures. Our opinion is that the
  key attempts made so far lack a coherent bridge between specifying constraints which
  models must satisfy and specifying their implementations. Focusing on building a
  such a bridge, we propose to apply category theory—precisely, the universal algebra
  of monads valued in a 2-category of parametric maps—as a single theory elegantly
  subsuming both of these flavours of neural network design. To defend our position,
  we show how this theory recovers constraints induced by geometric deep learning,
  as well as implementations of many architectures drawn from the diverse landscape
  of neural networks, such as RNNs. We also illustrate how the theory naturally encodes
  many standard constructs in computer science and automata theory.
