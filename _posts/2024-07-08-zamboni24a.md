title: 'How to Explore with Belief: State Entropy Maximization in POMDPs'
openreview: LbcNAIgNnB
abstract: Recent works have studied <em>state entropy maximization</em> in reinforcement
  learning, in which the agentâ€™s objective is to learn a policy inducing high entropy
  over states visitation (Hazan et al., 2019). They typically assume full observability
  of the state of the system, so that the entropy of the observations is maximized.
  In practice, the agent may only get <em>partial</em> observations, e.g., a robot
  perceiving the state of a physical space through proximity sensors and cameras.
  A significant mismatch between the entropy over observations and true states of
  the system can arise in those settings. In this paper, we address the problem of
  entropy maximization over the <em>true states</em> with a decision policy conditioned
  on partial observations <em>only</em>. The latter is a generalization of POMDPs,
  which is intractable in general. We develop a memory and computationally efficient
  <em>policy gradient</em> method to address a first-order relaxation of the objective
  defined on <em>belief</em> states, providing various formal characterizations of
  approximation gaps, the optimization landscape, and the <em>hallucination</em> problem.
  This paper aims to generalize state entropy maximization to more realistic domains
  that meet the challenges of applications.
