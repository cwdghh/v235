title: Combining Experimental and Historical Data for Policy Evaluation
openreview: nB6ERIud2y
abstract: This paper studies policy evaluation with multiple data sources, especially
  in scenarios that involve one experimental dataset with two arms, complemented by
  a historical dataset generated under a single control arm. We propose novel data
  integration methods that linearly integrate base policy value estimators constructed
  based on the experimental and historical data, with weights optimized to minimize
  the mean square error (MSE) of the resulting combined estimator. We further apply
  the pessimistic principle to obtain more robust estimators, and extend these developments
  to sequential decision making. Theoretically, we establish non-asymptotic error
  bounds for the MSEs of our proposed estimators, and derive their oracle, efficiency
  and robustness properties across a broad spectrum of reward shift scenarios. Numerical
  experiments and real-data-based analyses from a ridesharing company demonstrate
  the superior performance of the proposed estimators.
