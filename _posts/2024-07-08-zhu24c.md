title: Asymmetry in Low-Rank Adapters of Foundation Models
openreview: txRZBD8tBV
abstract: 'Parameter-efficient fine-tuning optimizes large, pre-trained foundation
  models by updating a subset of parameters; in this class, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
  is particularly effective. Inspired by an effort to investigate the different roles
  of LoRA matrices during fine-tuning, this paper characterizes and leverages unexpected
  asymmetry in the importance of low-rank adapter matrices. Specifically, when updating
  the parameter matrices of a neural network by adding a product $BA$, we observe
  that the $B$ and $A$ matrices have distinct functions: $A$ extracts features from
  the input, while $B$ uses these features to create the desired output. Based on
  this observation, we demonstrate that fine-tuning $B$ is inherently more effective
  than fine-tuning $A$, and that a random untrained $A$ should perform nearly as well
  as a fine-tuned one. Using an information-theoretic lens, we also bound the generalization
  of low-rank adapters, showing that the parameter savings of exclusively training
  $B$ improves the bound. We support our conclusions with experiments on RoBERTa,
  BART-Large, LLaMA-2, and ViTs. The code and data is available at https://github.com/Jiacheng-Zhu-AIML/AsymmetryLoRA'
