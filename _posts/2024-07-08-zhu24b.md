title: Generative Active Learning for Long-tailed Instance Segmentation
openreview: ofXRBPtol3
abstract: Recently, large-scale language-image generative models have gained widespread
  attention and many works have utilized generated data from these models to further
  enhance the performance of perception tasks. However, not all generated data can
  positively impact downstream models, and these methods do not thoroughly explore
  how to better select and utilize generated data. On the other hand, there is still
  a lack of research oriented towards active learning on generated data. In this paper,
  we explore how to perform active learning specifically for generated data in the
  long-tailed instance segmentation task. Subsequently, we propose BSGAL, a new algorithm
  that estimates the contribution of the current batch-generated data based on gradient
  cache. BSGAL is meticulously designed to cater for unlimited generated data and
  complex downstream segmentation tasks. BSGAL outperforms the baseline approach and
  effectually improves the performance of long-tailed segmentation.
