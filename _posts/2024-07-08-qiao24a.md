title: Ensemble Pruning for Out-of-distribution Generalization
openreview: eP3vsbB5wW
abstract: 'Ensemble of deep neural networks has achieved great success in hedging
  against single-model failure under distribution shift. However, existing techniques
  suffer from producing redundant models, limiting predictive diversity and yielding
  compromised generalization performance. Existing ensemble pruning methods can only
  guarantee predictive diversity for in-distribution data, which may not transfer
  well to out-of-distribution (OoD) data. To address this gap, we propose a principled
  optimization framework for ensemble pruning under distribution shifts. Since the
  annotations of test data are not available, we explore relationships between prediction
  distributions of the models, encapsulated in a topology graph. By incorporating
  this topology into a combinatorial optimization framework, complementary models
  with high predictive diversity are selected with theoretical guarantees. Our approach
  is model-agnostic and can be applied on top of a broad spectrum of off-the-shelf
  ensembling methods for improved generalization performance. Experiments on common
  benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach in both multi- and single-source
  OoD generalization. The source codes are publicly available at: https://github.com/joffery/TEP.'
