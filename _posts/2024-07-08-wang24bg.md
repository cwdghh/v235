title: Efficient Online Set-valued Classification with Bandit Feedback
openreview: R1auM3tLPE
abstract: Conformal prediction is a distribution-free method that wraps a given machine
  learning model and returns a set of plausible labels that contain the true label
  with a prescribed coverage rate. In practice, the empirical coverage achieved highly
  relies on fully observed label information from data both in the training phase
  for model fitting and the calibration phase for quantile estimation. This dependency
  poses a challenge in the context of online learning with bandit feedback, where
  a learner only has access to the correctness of actions (i.e., pulled an arm) but
  not the full information of the true label. In particular, when the pulled arm is
  incorrect, the learner only knows that the pulled one is not the true class label,
  but does not know which label is true. Additionally, bandit feedback further results
  in a smaller labeled dataset for calibration, limited to instances with correct
  actions, thereby affecting the accuracy of quantile estimation. To address these
  limitations, we propose Bandit Class-specific Conformal Prediction (BCCP), offering
  coverage guarantees on a class-specific granularity. Using an unbiased estimation
  of an estimand involving the true label, BCCP trains the model and makes set-valued
  inferences through stochastic gradient descent. Our approach overcomes the challenges
  of sparsely labeled data in each iteration and generalizes the reliability and applicability
  of conformal prediction to online decision-making environments.
