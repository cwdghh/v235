title: 'Vocabulary for Universal Approximation: A Linguistic Perspective of Mapping
  Compositions'
openreview: PnyYgWMMwj
abstract: 'In recent years, deep learning-based sequence modelings, such as language
  models, have received much attention and success, which pushes researchers to explore
  the possibility of transforming non-sequential problems into a sequential form.
  Following this thought, deep neural networks can be represented as composite functions
  of a sequence of mappings, linear or nonlinear, where each composition can be viewed
  as a word. However, the weights of linear mappings are undetermined and hence require
  an infinite number of words. In this article, we investigate the finite case and
  constructively prove the existence of a finite vocabulary $V$=$\phi_i: \mathbb{R}^d
  \to \mathbb{R}^d | i=1,...,n$ with $n=O(d^2)$ for the universal approximation. That
  is, for any continuous mapping $f: \mathbb{R}^d \to \mathbb{R}^d$, compact domain
  $\Omega$ and $\varepsilon>0$, there is a sequence of mappings $\phi_{i_1}, ...,
  \phi_{i_m} \in V, m \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, such that the composition $\phi_{i_m} \circ
  ... \circ \phi_{i_1} $ approximates $f$ on $\Omega$ with an error less than $\varepsilon$.
  Our results demonstrate an unusual approximation power of mapping compositions and
  motivate a novel compositional model for regular languages.'
