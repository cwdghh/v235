title: 'Mean Field Langevin Actor-Critic: Faster Convergence and Global Optimality
  beyond Lazy Learning'
openreview: FOJE1kRcHG
abstract: This work explores the feature learning capabilities of deep reinforcement
  learning algorithms in the pursuit of optimal policy determination. We particularly
  examine an over-parameterized neural actor-critic framework within the mean-field
  regime, where both actor and critic components undergo updates via policy gradient
  and temporal-difference (TD) learning, respectively. We introduce the <em>mean-field
  Langevin TD learning</em> (MFLTD) method, enhancing mean-field Langevin dynamics
  with proximal TD updates for critic policy evaluation, and assess its performance
  against conventional approaches through numerical analysis. Additionally, for actor
  policy updates, we present the <em>mean-field Langevin policy gradient</em> (MFLPG),
  employing policy gradient techniques augmented by Wasserstein gradient flows for
  parameter space exploration. Our findings demonstrate that MFLTD accurately identifies
  the true value function, while MFLPG ensures linear convergence of actor sequences
  towards the globally optimal policy, considering a Kullback-Leibler divergence regularized
  framework. Through both time particle and discretized analysis, we substantiate
  the linear convergence guarantees of our neural actor-critic algorithms, representing
  a notable contribution to neural reinforcement learning focusing on <em>global optimality</em>
  and <em>feature learning</em>, extending the existing understanding beyond the conventional
  scope of lazy training.
