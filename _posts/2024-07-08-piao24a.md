title: Federated Continual Learning via Prompt-based Dual Knowledge Transfer
openreview: Kqa5JakTjB
abstract: In Federated Continual Learning (FCL), the challenge lies in effectively
  facilitating knowledge transfer and enhancing the performance across various tasks
  on different clients. Current FCL methods predominantly focus on avoiding interference
  between tasks, thereby overlooking the potential for positive knowledge transfer
  across tasks learned by different clients at separate time intervals. To address
  this issue, we introduce a <b>P</b>rompt-based kn<b>ow</b>le<b>d</b>ge transf<b>er</b>
  FCL algorithm, called <b>Powder</b>, designed to effectively foster the transfer
  of knowledge encapsulated in prompts between various sequentially learned tasks
  and clients. Furthermore, we have devised a unique approach for prompt generation
  and aggregation, intending to alleviate privacy protection concerns and communication
  overhead, while still promoting knowledge transfer. Comprehensive experimental results
  demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of reduction in communication
  costs, and enhancement of knowledge transfer. Code is available at https://github.com/piaohongming/Powder.
