title: 'A Geometric Decomposition of Finite Games: Convergence vs. Recurrence under
  Exponential Weights'
openreview: 7RSIGQRT1F
abstract: 'In view of the complexity of the dynamics of learning in games, we seek
  to decompose a game into simpler components where the dynamics’ long-run behavior
  is well understood. A natural starting point for this is Helmholtz’s theorem, which
  decomposes a vector field into a potential and an incompressible component. However,
  the geometry of game dynamics - and, in particular, the dynamics of exponential
  / multiplicative weights (EW) schemes - is not compatible with the Euclidean underpinnings
  of Helmholtz’s theorem. This leads us to consider a specific Riemannian framework
  based on the so-called <em>Shahshahani metric</em>, and introduce the class of <em>incompressible
  games</em>, for which we establish the following results: First, in addition to
  being volume-preserving, the continuous-time EW dynamics in incompressible games
  admit a constant of motion and are <em>Poincaré recurrent</em> - i.e., almost every
  trajectory of play comes arbitrarily close to its starting point infinitely often.
  Second, we establish a deep connection with a well-known decomposition of games
  into a potential and harmonic component (where the players’ objectives are aligned
  and anti-aligned respectively): a game is incompressible if and only if it is harmonic,
  implying in turn that the EW dynamics lead to Poincaré recurrence in harmonic games.'
