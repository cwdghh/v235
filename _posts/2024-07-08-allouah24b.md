title: The Privacy Power of Correlated Noise in Decentralized Learning
openreview: 5JrlywYHRi
abstract: Decentralized learning is appealing as it enables the scalable usage of
  large amounts of distributed data and resources without resorting to any central
  entity, while promoting privacy since every user minimizes the direct exposure of
  their data. Yet, without additional precautions, curious users can still leverage
  models obtained from their peers to violate privacy. In this paper, we propose Decor,
  a variant of decentralized SGD with differential privacy (DP) guarantees. Essentially,
  in Decor, users securely exchange randomness seeds in one communication round to
  generate pairwise-canceling correlated Gaussian noises, which are injected to protect
  local models at every communication round. We theoretically and empirically show
  that, for arbitrary connected graphs, Decor matches the central DP optimal privacy-utility
  trade-off. We do so under SecLDP, our new relaxation of local DP, which protects
  all user communications against an external eavesdropper and curious users, assuming
  that every pair of connected users shares a secret, i.e., an information hidden
  to all others. The main theoretical challenge is to control the accumulation of
  non-canceling correlated noise due to network sparsity. We also propose a companion
  SecLDP privacy accountant for public use.
