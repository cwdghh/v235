title: 'Hard Tasks First: Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning Through Task Scheduling'
openreview: haUOhXo70o
abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (RL) faces the significant challenge of
  varying task difficulties, often leading to negative transfer when simpler tasks
  overshadow the learning of more complex ones. To overcome this challenge, we propose
  a novel algorithm, Scheduled Multi-Task Training (SMT), that strategically prioritizes
  more challenging tasks, thereby enhancing overall learning efficiency. SMT introduces
  a dynamic task prioritization strategy, underpinned by an effective metric for assessing
  task difficulty. This metric ensures an efficient and targeted allocation of training
  resources, significantly improving learning outcomes. Additionally, SMT incorporates
  a reset mechanism that periodically reinitializes key network parameters to mitigate
  the simplicity bias, further enhancing the adaptability and robustness of the learning
  process across diverse tasks. The efficacy of SMTâ€™s scheduling method is validated
  by significantly improving performance on challenging Meta-World benchmarks.
