title: On a Neural Implementation of Brenier’s Polar Factorization
openreview: zDCwJQY3eI
abstract: In 1991, Brenier proved a theorem that generalizes the polar decomposition
  for square matrices – factored as PSD $\times$ unitary – to any vector field $F:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow
  \mathbb{R}^d$. The theorem, known as the polar factorization theorem, states that
  any field $F$ can be recovered as the composition of the gradient of a convex function
  $u$ with a measure-preserving map $M$, namely $F=\nabla u \circ M$. We propose a
  practical implementation of this far-reaching theoretical result, and explore possible
  uses within machine learning. The theorem is closely related to optimal transport
  (OT) theory, and we borrow from recent advances in the field of neural optimal transport
  to parameterize the potential $u$ as an input convex neural network. The map $M$
  can be either evaluated pointwise using $u^*$, the convex conjugate of $u$, through
  the identity $M=\nabla u^* \circ F$, or learned as an auxiliary network. Because
  $M$ is, in general, not injective, we consider the additional task of estimating
  the ill-posed inverse map that can approximate the pre-image measure $M^{-1}$ using
  a stochastic generator. We illustrate possible applications of Brenier’s polar factorization
  to non-convex optimization problems, as well as sampling of densities that are not
  log-concave.
