title: Privacy Profiles for Private Selection
openreview: hgHQvrvwH9
abstract: Private selection mechanisms (e.g., Report Noisy Max, Sparse Vector) are
  fundamental primitives of differentially private (DP) data analysis with wide applications
  to private query release, voting, and hyperparameter tuning. Recent work (Liu and
  Talwar, 2019; Papernot and Steinke, 2022) has made significant progress in both
  generalizing private selection mechanisms and tightening their privacy analysis
  using modern numerical privacy accounting tools, e.g., Rényi DP. But Rényi DP is
  known to be lossy when $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP is ultimately needed, and there is
  a trend to close the gap by directly handling privacy profiles, i.e., $\delta$ as
  a function of $\epsilon$ or its equivalent dual form known as $f$-DPs. In this paper,
  we work out an easy-to-use recipe that bounds the privacy profiles of ReportNoisyMax
  and PrivateTuning using the privacy profiles of the base algorithms they corral.
  Numerically, our approach improves over the RDP-based accounting in all regimes
  of interest and leads to substantial benefits in end-to-end private learning experiments.
  Our analysis also suggests new distributions, e.g., binomial distribution for randomizing
  the number of rounds that leads to more substantial improvements in certain regimes.
