title: 'Deciphering RNA Secondary Structure Prediction: A Probabilistic K-Rook Matching
  Perspective'
openreview: Ada9Z68nvb
abstract: The secondary structure of ribonucleic acid (RNA) is more stable and accessible
  in the cell than its tertiary structure, making it essential for functional prediction.
  Although deep learning has shown promising results in this field, current methods
  suffer from poor generalization and high complexity. In this work, we reformulate
  the RNA secondary structure prediction as a K-Rook problem, thereby simplifying
  the prediction process into probabilistic matching within a finite solution space.
  Building on this innovative perspective, we introduce RFold, a simple yet effective
  method that learns to predict the most matching K-Rook solution from the given sequence.
  RFold employs a bi-dimensional optimization strategy that decomposes the probabilistic
  matching problem into row-wise and column-wise components to reduce the matching
  complexity, simplifying the solving process while guaranteeing the validity of the
  output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RFold achieves competitive performance
  and about eight times faster inference efficiency than the state-of-the-art approaches.
