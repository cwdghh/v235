title: Reducing sequential change detection to sequential estimation
openreview: EZLsxOgcDg
abstract: 'We consider the problem of sequential change detection under minimal assumptions
  on the distribution generating the stream of observations. Formally, our goal is
  to design a scheme for detecting any changes in a parameter or functional $\theta$
  of the data stream distribution that has small detection delay, but guarantees control
  on the frequency of false alarms in the absence of changes. We describe a simple
  reduction from sequential change detection to sequential estimation using confidence
  sequences (CSs): begin a new level-$(1-\alpha)$ CS at each time step, and proclaim
  a change as soon as the intersection of all active CSs becomes empty. We prove that
  the average run length of our scheme is at least $1/\alpha$, resulting in a change
  detection scheme with minimal structural assumptions (thus allowing for possibly
  dependent observations, and nonparametric distribution classes), but strong guarantees.
  We also describe an interesting parallel with Lorden’s reduction from change detection
  to sequential testing and connections to the recent ”e-detector” framework.'
