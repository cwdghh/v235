title: Bridging Model Heterogeneity in Federated Learning via Uncertainty-based Asymmetrical
  Reciprocity Learning
openreview: p0MGN0LSnx
abstract: This paper presents FedType, a simple yet pioneering framework designed
  to fill research gaps in heterogeneous model aggregation within federated learning
  (FL). FedType introduces small identical proxy models for clients, serving as agents
  for information exchange, ensuring model security, and achieving efficient communication
  simultaneously. To transfer knowledge between large private and small proxy models
  on clients, we propose a novel uncertainty-based asymmetrical reciprocity learning
  method, eliminating the need for any public data. Comprehensive experiments conducted
  on benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy and generalization ability of FedType
  across diverse settings. Our approach redefines federated learning paradigms by
  bridging model heterogeneity, eliminating reliance on public data, prioritizing
  client privacy, and reducing communication costs (The codes are available in the
  supplementation materials).
