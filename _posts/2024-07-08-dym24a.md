title: Equivariant Frames and the Impossibility of Continuous Canonicalization
openreview: 4iy0q0carb
abstract: 'Canonicalization provides an architecture-agnostic method for enforcing
  equivariance, with generalizations such as frame-averaging recently gaining prominence
  as a lightweight and flexible alternative to equivariant architectures. Recent works
  have found an empirical benefit to using probabilistic frames instead, which learn
  weighted distributions over group elements. In this work, we provide strong theoretical
  justification for this phenomenon: for commonly-used groups, there is no efficiently
  computable choice of frame that preserves continuity of the function being averaged.
  In other words, unweighted frame-averaging can turn a smooth, non-symmetric function
  into a discontinuous, symmetric function. To address this fundamental robustness
  problem, we formally define and construct <em>weighted</em> frames, which provably
  preserve continuity, and demonstrate their utility by constructing efficient and
  continuous weighted frames for the actions of $SO(d)$, $O(d)$, and $S_n$ on point
  clouds.'
