title: 'Navigating Complexity: Toward Lossless Graph Condensation via Expanding Window
  Matching'
openreview: gE7qZurGH3
abstract: Graph condensation aims to reduce the size of a large-scale graph dataset
  by synthesizing a compact counterpart without sacrificing the performance of Graph
  Neural Networks (GNNs) trained on it, which has shed light on reducing the computational
  cost for training GNNs. Nevertheless, existing methods often fall short of accurately
  replicating the original graph for certain datasets, thereby failing to achieve
  the objective of lossless condensation. To understand this phenomenon, we investigate
  the potential reasons and reveal that the previous state-of-the-art trajectory matching
  method provides biased and restricted supervision signals from the original graph
  when optimizing the condensed one. This significantly limits both the scale and
  efficacy of the condensed graph. In this paper, we make the first attempt toward
  <em>lossless graph condensation</em> by bridging the previously neglected supervision
  signals. Specifically, we employ a curriculum learning strategy to train expert
  trajectories with more diverse supervision signals from the original graph, and
  then effectively transfer the information into the condensed graph with expanding
  window matching. Moreover, we design a loss function to further extract knowledge
  from the expert trajectories. Theoretical analysis justifies the design of our method
  and extensive experiments verify its superiority across different datasets. Code
