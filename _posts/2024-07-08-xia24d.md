title: 'SMaRt: Improving GANs with Score Matching Regularity'
openreview: lqeVCc9zYq
abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) usually struggle in learning from
  highly diverse data, whose underlying manifold is complex. In this work, we revisit
  the mathematical foundations of GANs, and theoretically reveal that the native adversarial
  loss for GAN training is insufficient to fix the problem of $\textit{subsets with
  positive Lebesgue measure of the generated data manifold lying out of the real data
  manifold}$. Instead, we find that score matching serves as a promising solution
  to this issue thanks to its capability of persistently pushing the generated data
  points towards the real data manifold. We thereby propose to improve the optimization
  of GANs with score matching regularity (SMaRt). Regarding the empirical evidences,
  we first design a toy example to show that training GANs by the aid of a ground-truth
  score function can help reproduce the real data distribution more accurately, and
  then confirm that our approach can consistently boost the synthesis performance
  of various state-of-the-art GANs on real-world datasets with pre-trained diffusion
  models acting as the approximate score function. For instance, when training Aurora
  on the ImageNet $64\times64$ dataset, we manage to improve FID from 8.87 to 7.11,
  on par with the performance of one-step consistency model. Code is available at
