title: Stereographic Spherical Sliced Wasserstein Distances
openreview: vLtVGtEz5h
abstract: Comparing spherical probability distributions is of great interest in various
  fields, including geology, medical domains, computer vision, and deep representation
  learning. The utility of optimal transport-based distances, such as the Wasserstein
  distance, for comparing probability measures has spurred active research in developing
  computationally efficient variations of these distances for spherical probability
  measures. This paper introduces a high-speed and highly parallelizable distance
  for comparing spherical measures using the stereographic projection and the generalized
  Radon transform, which we refer to as the Stereographic Spherical Sliced Wasserstein
  (S3W) distance. We carefully address the distance distortion caused by the stereographic
  projection and provide an extensive theoretical analysis of our proposed metric
  and its rotationally invariant variation. Finally, we evaluate the performance of
  the proposed metrics and compare them with recent baselines in terms of both speed
  and accuracy through a wide range of numerical studies, including gradient flows
  and self-supervised learning. Our code is available at https://github.com/mint-vu/s3wd.
