title: 'FedSC: Provable Federated Self-supervised Learning with Spectral Contrastive
  Objective over Non-i.i.d. Data'
openreview: 0nMzOmkBHC
abstract: Recent efforts have been made to integrate self-supervised learning (SSL)
  with the framework of federated learning (FL). One unique challenge of federated
  self-supervised learning (FedSSL) is that the global objective of FedSSL usually
  does not equal the weighted sum of local SSL objectives. Consequently, conventional
  approaches, such as federated averaging (FedAvg), fail to precisely minimize the
  FedSSL global objective, often resulting in suboptimal performance, especially when
  data is non-i.i.d.. To fill this gap, we propose a provable FedSSL algorithm, named
  FedSC, based on the spectral contrastive objective. In FedSC, clients share correlation
  matrices of data representations in addition to model weights periodically, which
  enables inter-client contrast of data samples in addition to intra-client contrast
  and contraction, resulting in improved quality of data representations. Differential
  privacy (DP) protection is deployed to control the additional privacy leakage on
  local datasets when correlation matrices are shared. We provide theoretical analysis
  on convergence and extra privacy leakage, and conduct numerical experiments to justify
  the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.
