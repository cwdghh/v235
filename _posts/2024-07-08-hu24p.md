title: Bayesian Design Principles for Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning
openreview: HLHQxMydFk
abstract: 'Offline reinforcement learning (RL) is crucial for real-world applications
  where exploration can be costly or unsafe. However, offline learned policies are
  often suboptimal, and further online fine-tuning is required. In this paper, we
  tackle the fundamental dilemma of offline-to-online fine-tuning: if the agent remains
  pessimistic, it may fail to learn a better policy, while if it becomes optimistic
  directly, performance may suffer from a sudden drop. We show that Bayesian design
  principles are crucial in solving such a dilemma. Instead of adopting optimistic
  or pessimistic policies, the agent should act in a way that matches its belief in
  optimal policies. Such a probability-matching agent can avoid a sudden performance
  drop while still being guaranteed to find the optimal policy. Based on our theoretical
  findings, we introduce a novel algorithm that outperforms existing methods on various
  benchmarks, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach. Overall, the proposed approach
  provides a new perspective on offline-to-online RL that has the potential to enable
  more effective learning from offline data.'
