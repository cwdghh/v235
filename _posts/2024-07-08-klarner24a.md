title: Context-Guided Diffusion for Out-of-Distribution Molecular and Protein Design
openreview: 8NfHmzo0Op
abstract: Generative models have the potential to accelerate key steps in the discovery
  of novel molecular therapeutics and materials. Diffusion models have recently emerged
  as a powerful approach, excelling at unconditional sample generation and, with data-driven
  guidance, conditional generation within their training domain. Reliably sampling
  from high-value regions beyond the training data, however, remains an open challengeâ€”with
  current methods predominantly focusing on modifying the diffusion process itself.
  In this paper, we develop context-guided diffusion (CGD), a simple plug-and-play
  method that leverages unlabeled data and smoothness constraints to improve the out-of-distribution
  generalization of guided diffusion models. We demonstrate that this approach leads
  to substantial performance gains across various settings, including continuous,
  discrete, and graph-structured diffusion processes with applications across drug
  discovery, materials science, and protein design.
