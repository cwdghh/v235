title: 'UPAM: Unified Prompt Attack in Text-to-Image Generation Models Against Both
  Textual Filters and Visual Checkers'
openreview: KU9mn6deDR
abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have raised security concerns due to their potential
  to generate inappropriate or harmful images. In this paper, we propose UPAM, a novel
  framework that investigates the robustness of T2I models from the attack perspective.
  Unlike most existing attack methods that focus on deceiving textual defenses, UPAM
  aims to deceive both textual and visual defenses in T2I models. UPAM enables gradient-based
  optimization, offering greater effectiveness and efficiency than previous methods.
  Given that T2I models might not return results due to defense mechanisms, we introduce
  a Sphere-Probing Learning (SPL) scheme to support gradient optimization even when
  no results are returned. Additionally, we devise a Semantic-Enhancing Learning (SEL)
  scheme to finetune UPAM for generating target-aligned images. Our framework also
  ensures attack stealthiness. Extensive experiments demonstrate UPAMâ€™s effectiveness
  and efficiency.
