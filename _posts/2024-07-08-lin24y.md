title: Smooth Tchebycheff Scalarization for Multi-Objective Optimization
openreview: m4dO5L6eCp
abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems can be found in many real-world applications,
  where the objectives often conflict each other and cannot be optimized by a single
  solution. In the past few decades, numerous methods have been proposed to find Pareto
  solutions that represent optimal trade-offs among the objectives for a given problem.
  However, these existing methods could have high computational complexity or may
  not have good theoretical properties for solving a general differentiable multi-objective
  optimization problem. In this work, by leveraging the smooth optimization technique,
  we propose a lightweight and efficient smooth Tchebycheff scalarization approach
  for gradient-based multi-objective optimization. It has good theoretical properties
  for finding all Pareto solutions with valid trade-off preferences, while enjoying
  significantly lower computational complexity compared to other methods. Experimental
  results on various real-world application problems fully demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our proposed method.
