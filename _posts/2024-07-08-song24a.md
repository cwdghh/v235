title: Hybrid Reinforcement Learning from Offline Observation Alone
openreview: c6rVlTKpb5
abstract: We consider the hybrid reinforcement learning setting where the agent has
  access to both offline data and online interactive access. While RL research typically
  assumes offline data contains complete action, reward and transition information,
  datasets with only state information (also known as <em>observation-only</em> datasets)
  are more general, abundant and practical. This motivates our study of the <em>hybrid
  RL with observation-only offline dataset</em> framework. While the task of competing
  with the best policy “covered” by the offline data can be solved if a <em>reset</em>
  model of the environment is provided (i.e., one that can be reset to any state),
  we show evidence of hardness of competing when only given the weaker <em>trace</em>
  model (i.e., one can only reset to the initial states and must produce full traces
  through the environment), without further assumption of <em>admissibility</em> of
  the offline data. Under the admissibility assumptions– that the offline data could
  actually be produced by the policy class we consider– we propose the first algorithm
  in the trace model setting that provably matches the performance of algorithms that
  leverage a reset model. We also perform proof-of-concept experiments that suggest
  the effectiveness of our algorithm in practice.
