title: 'MOMENT: A Family of Open Time-series Foundation Models'
openreview: FVvf69a5rx
abstract: We introduce MOMENT, a family of open-source foundation models for general-purpose
  time series analysis. Pre-training large models on time series data is challenging
  due to (1) the absence of a large and cohesive public time series repository, and
  (2) diverse time series characteristics which make multi-dataset training onerous.
  Additionally, (3) experimental benchmarks to evaluate these models, especially in
  scenarios with limited resources, time, and supervision, are still in their nascent
  stages. To address these challenges, we compile a large and diverse collection of
  public time series, called the Time series Pile, and systematically tackle time
  series-specific challenges to unlock large-scale multi-dataset pre-training. Finally,
  we build on recent work to design a benchmark to evaluate time series foundation
  models on diverse tasks and datasets in limited supervision settings. Experiments
  on this benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our pre-trained models with minimal
  data and task-specific fine-tuning. Finally, we present several interesting empirical
  observations about large pre-trained time series models. Pre-trained models (AutonLab/MOMENT-1-large)
  and Time Series Pile (AutonLab/Timeseries-PILE) are available on Huggingface.
