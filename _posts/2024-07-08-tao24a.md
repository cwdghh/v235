title: 'MLI Formula: A Nearly Scale-Invariant Solution with Noise Perturbation'
openreview: SvBLKoBL4q
abstract: Monotonic Linear Interpolation (MLI) refers to the peculiar phenomenon that
  the error between the initial and converged model monotonically decreases along
  the linear interpolation, i.e., $(1-\alpha)\boldsymbol{\theta}_0 + \alpha \boldsymbol{\theta}_F$.
  Previous works focus on paired initial and converged points, relating MLI to the
  smoothness of the optimization trajectory. In this paper, we find a shocking fact
  that the error curves still exhibit a monotonic decrease when $\boldsymbol{\theta}_0$
  is replaced with noise or even zero values, implying that the decreasing curve may
  be primarily related to the property of the converged model rather than the optimization
  trajectory. We further explore the relationship between $\alpha\boldsymbol{\theta}_F$
  and $\boldsymbol{\theta}_F$ and propose scale invariance properties in various cases,
  including Generalized Scale Invariance (GSI), Rectified Scale Invariance (RSI),
  and Normalized Scale Invariance (NSI). From an inverse perspective, the MLI formula
  is essentially an equation that adds varying levels of noise (i.e., $(1-\alpha)\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$)
  to a nearly scale-invariant network (i.e., $\alpha \boldsymbol{\theta}_F$), resulting
  in a monotonically increasing error as the noise level rises. MLI is a special case
  where $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$ is equal to $\boldsymbol{\theta}_0$.
