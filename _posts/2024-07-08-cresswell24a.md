title: Conformal Prediction Sets Improve Human Decision Making
openreview: 4CO45y7Mlv
abstract: In response to everyday queries, humans explicitly signal uncertainty and
  offer alternative answers when they are unsure. Machine learning models that output
  calibrated prediction sets through conformal prediction mimic this human behaviour;
  larger sets signal greater uncertainty while providing alternatives. In this work,
  we study the usefulness of conformal prediction sets as an aid for human decision
  making by conducting a pre-registered randomized controlled trial with conformal
  prediction sets provided to human subjects. With statistical significance, we find
  that when humans are given conformal prediction sets their accuracy on tasks improves
  compared to fixed-size prediction sets with the same coverage guarantee. The results
  show that quantifying model uncertainty with conformal prediction is helpful for
  human-in-the-loop decision making and human-AI teams.
