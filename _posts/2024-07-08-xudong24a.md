title: Iterative Regularized Policy Optimization with Imperfect Demonstrations
openreview: Gp5F6qzwGK
abstract: Imitation learning heavily relies on the quality of provided demonstrations.
  In scenarios where demonstrations are imperfect and rare, a prevalent approach for
  refining policies is through online fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, in
  which a Kullbackâ€“Leibler (KL) regularization is often employed to stabilize the
  learning process. However, our investigation reveals that on the one hand, imperfect
  demonstrations can bias the online learning process, the KL regularization will
  further constrain the improvement of online policy exploration. To address the above
  issues, we propose Iterative Regularized Policy Optimization (IRPO), a framework
  that involves iterative offline imitation learning and online reinforcement exploration.
  Specifically, the policy learned online is used to serve as the demonstrator for
  successive learning iterations, with a demonstration boosting to consistently enhance
  the quality of demonstrations. Experimental validations conducted across widely
  used benchmarks and a novel fixed-wing UAV control task consistently demonstrate
  the effectiveness of IRPO in improving both the demonstration quality and the policy
  performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/GongXudong/IRPO.
