title: Efficient Stochastic Approximation of Minimax Excess Risk Optimization
openreview: oTYuORAMaP
abstract: While traditional distributionally robust optimization (DRO) aims to minimize
  the maximal risk over a set of distributions, Agarwal & Zhang (2022) recently proposed
  a variant that replaces risk with <em>excess risk</em>. Compared to DRO, the new
  formulationâ€”minimax excess risk optimization (MERO) has the advantage of suppressing
  the effect of heterogeneous noise in different distributions. However, the choice
  of excess risk leads to a very challenging minimax optimization problem, and currently
  there exists only an inefficient algorithm for empirical MERO. In this paper, we
  develop efficient stochastic approximation approaches which directly target MERO.
  Specifically, we leverage techniques from stochastic convex optimization to estimate
  the minimal risk of every distribution, and solve MERO as a stochastic convex-concave
  optimization (SCCO) problem with biased gradients. The presence of bias makes existing
  theoretical guarantees of SCCO inapplicable, and fortunately, we demonstrate that
  the bias, caused by the estimation error of the minimal risk, is under-control.
  Thus, MERO can still be optimized with a nearly optimal convergence rate. Moreover,
  we investigate a practical scenario where the quantity of samples drawn from each
  distribution may differ, and propose a stochastic approach that delivers <em>distribution-dependent</em>
  convergence rates.
