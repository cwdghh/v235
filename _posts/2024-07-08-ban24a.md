title: Fair Resource Allocation in Multi-Task Learning
openreview: KLmWRMg6nL
abstract: By jointly learning multiple tasks, multi-task learning (MTL) can leverage
  the shared knowledge across tasks, resulting in improved data efficiency and generalization
  performance. However, a major challenge in MTL lies in the presence of conflicting
  gradients, which can hinder the fair optimization of some tasks and subsequently
  impede MTLâ€™s ability to achieve better overall performance. Inspired by fair resource
  allocation in communication networks, we formulate the optimization of MTL as a
  utility maximization problem, where the loss decreases across tasks are maximized
  under different fairness measurements. To address the problem, we propose FairGrad,
  a novel optimization objective. FairGrad not only enables flexible emphasis on certain
  tasks but also achieves a theoretical convergence guarantee. Extensive experiments
  demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance among gradient
  manipulation methods on a suite of multi-task benchmarks in supervised learning
  and reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we incorporate the idea of $\alpha$-fairness
  into the loss functions of various MTL methods. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate
  that their performance can be significantly enhanced. Code is available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/fairgrad.
