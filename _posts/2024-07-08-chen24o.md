title: 'CogDPM: Diffusion Probabilistic Models via Cognitive Predictive Coding'
openreview: iLSgF7jMtI
abstract: 'Predictive Coding (PC) is a theoretical framework in cognitive science
  suggesting that the human brain processes cognition through spatiotemporal prediction
  of visual world. Existing studies have developed spatiotemporal prediction neural
  networks based on the PC theroy, emulating its two core mechanisms: Correcting predictions
  from residuals and Hierarchical learning. However, these models do not show the
  enhancement of prediction skills on real-world forecasting tasks, and ignore the
  Precision Weighting mechanism of PC theory. Precision weight posits that the brain
  allocates more attention to signals with lower Precision, contributing to the the
  cognitive ability of human brains. This work introduces the Cognitive Diffusion
  Probabilistic Models (CogDPM) which demonstrates the connection between diffusion
  probabilistic models and PC theory. CogDPM features a precision estimation method
  based on the hierarchical sampling capabilities of diffusion models, and allocate
  the guidance with precision weights estimated by the inherent property of diffusion
  models. We experimentally show that the precision weights is an estimator of modelâ€™s
  predictability on the rigid body and fluid motion dataset. We also apply CogDPM
  to real-world prediction tasks using the U.K. precipitation and ERA surface wind
  datasets. Our results demonstrate that CogDPM outperforms both existing domain-specific
  operational models and general deep prediction models in providing more proficient
  forecasting.'
