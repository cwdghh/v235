title: 'Decoupling Learning and Decision-Making: Breaking the $\mathcalO(\sqrtT)$
  Barrier in Online Resource Allocation with First-Order Methods'
openreview: 1DyruVvVaQ
abstract: Online linear programming plays an important role in both revenue management
  and resource allocation, and recent research has focused on developing efficient
  first-order online learning algorithms. Despite the empirical success of first-order
  methods, they typically achieve regret no better than $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$, which
  is suboptimal compared to the $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ result guaranteed by the state-of-the-art
  linear programming (LP)-based online algorithms. This paper establishes several
  important facts about online linear programming, which unveils the challenge for
  first-order online algorithms to achieve beyond $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret.
  To address this challenge, we introduce a new algorithmic framework which decouples
  learning from decision-making. For the first time, we show that first-order methods
  can achieve regret $\mathcal{O}(T^{1/3})$ with this new framework.
