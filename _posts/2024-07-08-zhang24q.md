title: 'SF-DQN: Provable Knowledge Transfer using Successor Feature for Deep Reinforcement
  Learning'
openreview: pDoAjdrMf0
abstract: 'This paper studies the transfer reinforcement learning (RL) problem where
  multiple RL problems have different reward functions but share the same underlying
  transition dynamics. In this setting, the Q-function of each RL problem (task) can
  be decomposed into a successor feature (SF) and a reward mapping: the former characterizes
  the transition dynamics, and the latter characterizes the task-specific reward function.
  This Q-function decomposition, coupled with a policy improvement operator known
  as generalized policy improvement (GPI), reduces the sample complexity of finding
  the optimal Q-function, and thus the SF & GPI framework exhibits promising empirical
  performance compared to traditional RL methods like Q-learning. However, its theoretical
  foundations remain largely unestablished, especially when learning the successor
  features using deep neural networks (SF-DQN). This paper studies the provable knowledge
  transfer using SFs-DQN in transfer RL problems. We establish the first convergence
  analysis with provable generalization guarantees for SF-DQN with GPI. The theory
  reveals that SF-DQN with GPI outperforms conventional RL approaches, such as deep
  Q-network, in terms of both faster convergence rate and better generalization. Numerical
  experiments on real and synthetic RL tasks support the superior performance of SF-DQN
  & GPI, aligning with our theoretical findings.'
