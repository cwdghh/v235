title: Amortizing Pragmatic Program Synthesis with Rankings
openreview: yj8h567Ia7
abstract: The usage of Rational Speech Acts (RSA) framework has been successful in
  building <em>pragmatic</em> program synthesizers that return programs which, in
  addition to being logically consistent with user-generated examples, account for
  the fact that a user chooses their examples informatively. We present a general
  method of amortizing the slow, exact RSA synthesizer. Our method first compiles
  a communication dataset of partially ranked programs by querying the exact RSA synthesizer.
  It then distills a <em>global ranking</em> â€“ a single, total ordering of all programs,
  to approximate the partial rankings from this dataset. This global ranking is then
  used at inference time to rank multiple logically consistent candidate programs
  generated from a fast, non-pragmatic synthesizer. Experiments on two program synthesis
  domains using our ranking method resulted in orders of magnitudes of speed ups compared
  to the exact RSA synthesizer, while being more accurate than a non-pragmatic synthesizer.
  Finally, we prove that in the special case of synthesis from a single example, this
  approximation is exact.
