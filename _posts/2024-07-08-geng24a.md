title: Improving Adversarial Energy-Based Model via Diffusion Process
openreview: QXEx16jWdN
abstract: Generative models have shown strong generation ability while efficient likelihood
  estimation is less explored. Energy-based models (EBMs) define a flexible energy
  function to parameterize unnormalized densities efficiently but are notorious for
  being difficult to train. Adversarial EBMs introduce a generator to form a minimax
  training game to avoid expensive MCMC sampling used in traditional EBMs, but a noticeable
  gap between adversarial EBMs and other strong generative models still exists. Inspired
  by diffusion-based models, we embedded EBMs into each denoising step to split a
  long-generated process into several smaller steps. Besides, we employ a symmetric
  Jeffrey divergence and introduce a variational posterior distribution for the generator’s
  training to address the main challenges that exist in adversarial EBMs. Our experiments
  show significant improvement in generation compared to existing adversarial EBMs,
  while also providing a useful energy function for efficient density estimation.
