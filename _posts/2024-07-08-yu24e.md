title: Privacy-Preserving Instructions for Aligning Large Language Models
openreview: mUT1biz09t
abstract: Service providers of large language model (LLM) applications collect user
  instructions in the wild and use them in further aligning LLMs with usersâ€™ intentions.
  These instructions, which potentially contain sensitive information, are annotated
  by human workers in the process. This poses a new privacy risk not addressed by
  the typical private optimization. To this end, we propose using synthetic instructions
  to replace real instructions in data annotation and model fine-tuning. Formal differential
  privacy is guaranteed by generating those synthetic instructions using privately
  fine-tuned generators. Crucial in achieving the desired utility is our novel filtering
  algorithm that matches the distribution of the synthetic instructions to that of
  the real ones. In both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human
  feedback, our extensive experiments demonstrate the high utility of the final set
  of synthetic instructions by showing comparable results to real instructions. In
  supervised fine-tuning, models trained with private synthetic instructions outperform
  leading open-source models such as Vicuna.
