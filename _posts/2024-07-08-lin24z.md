title: 'PPFLOW: Target-Aware Peptide Design with Torsional Flow Matching'
openreview: 70jplnkLMe
abstract: Therapeutic peptides have proven to have great pharmaceutical value and
  potential in recent decades. However, methods of AI-assisted peptide drug discovery
  are not fully explored. To fill the gap, we propose a target-aware peptide design
  method called PPFlow, based on conditional flow matching on torus manifolds, to
  model the internal geometries of torsion angles for the peptide structure design.
  Besides, we establish a protein-peptide binding dataset named PPBench2024 to fill
  the void of massive data for the task of structure-based peptide drug design and
  to allow the training of deep learning methods. Extensive experiments show that
  PPFlow reaches state-of-the-art performance in tasks of peptide drug generation
  and optimization in comparison with baseline models, and can be generalized to other
  tasks including docking and side-chain packing.
