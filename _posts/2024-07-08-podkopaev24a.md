title: Adaptive Conformal Inference by Betting
openreview: lwWV4Zl3h1
abstract: Conformal prediction is a valuable tool for quantifying predictive uncertainty
  of machine learning models. However, its applicability relies on the assumption
  of data exchangeability, a condition which is often not met in real-world scenarios.
  In this paper, we consider the problem of adaptive conformal inference without any
  assumptions about the data generating process. Existing approaches for adaptive
  conformal inference are based on optimizing the pinball loss using variants of online
  gradient descent. A notable shortcoming of such approaches is in their explicit
  dependence on and sensitivity to the choice of the learning rates. In this paper,
  we propose a different approach for adaptive conformal inference that leverages
  parameter-free online convex optimization techniques. We prove that our method controls
  long-term miscoverage frequency at a nominal level and demonstrate its convincing
  empirical performance without any need of performing cumbersome parameter tuning.
