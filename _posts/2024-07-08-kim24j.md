title: Synergistic Integration of Coordinate Network and Tensorial Feature for Improving
  Neural Radiance Fields from Sparse Inputs
openreview: 7tyAO5tUF8
abstract: The multi-plane representation has been highlighted for its fast training
  and inference across static and dynamic neural radiance fields. This approach constructs
  relevant features via projection onto learnable grids and interpolating adjacent
  vertices. However, it has limitations in capturing low-frequency details and tends
  to overuse parameters for low-frequency features due to its bias toward fine details,
  despite its multi-resolution concept. This phenomenon leads to instability and inefficiency
  when training poses are sparse. In this work, we propose a method that synergistically
  integrates multi-plane representation with a coordinate-based MLP network known
  for strong bias toward low-frequency signals. The coordinate-based network is responsible
  for capturing low-frequency details, while the multi-plane representation focuses
  on capturing fine-grained details. We demonstrate that using residual connections
  between them seamlessly preserves their own inherent properties. Additionally, the
  proposed progressive training scheme accelerates the disentanglement of these two
  features. We demonstrate empirically that our proposed method not only outperforms
  baseline models for both static and dynamic NeRFs with sparse inputs, but also achieves
  comparable results with fewer parameters.
