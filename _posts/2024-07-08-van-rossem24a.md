title: 'When Representations Align: Universality in Representation Learning Dynamics'
openreview: m5nB7ucXHT
abstract: Deep neural networks come in many sizes and architectures. The choice of
  architecture, in conjunction with the dataset and learning algorithm, is commonly
  understood to affect the learned neural representations. Yet, recent results have
  shown that different architectures learn representations with striking qualitative
  similarities. Here we derive an effective theory of representation learning under
  the assumption that the encoding map from input to hidden representation and the
  decoding map from representation to output are arbitrary smooth functions. This
  theory schematizes representation learning dynamics in the regime of complex, large
  architectures, where hidden representations are not strongly constrained by the
  parametrization. We show through experiments that the effective theory describes
  aspects of representation learning dynamics across a range of deep networks with
  different activation functions and architectures, and exhibits phenomena similar
  to the “rich” and “lazy” regime. While many network behaviors depend quantitatively
  on architecture, our findings point to certain behaviors that are widely conserved
  once models are sufficiently flexible.
