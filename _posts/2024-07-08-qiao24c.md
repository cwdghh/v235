title: 'ULAREF: A Unified Label Refinement Framework for Learning with Inaccurate
  Supervision'
openreview: ssFMq35UUY
abstract: Learning with inaccurate supervision is often encountered in weakly supervised
  learning, and researchers have invested a considerable amount of time and effort
  in designing specialized algorithms for different forms of annotations in inaccurate
  supervision. In fact, different forms of these annotations share the fundamental
  characteristic that they all still incorporate some portion of correct labeling
  information. This commonality can serve as a lever, enabling the creation of a cohesive
  framework designed to tackle the challenges associated with various forms of annotations
  in learning with inaccurate supervision. In this paper, we propose a unified label
  refinement framework named ULAREF, i.e., a Unified LAbel REfinement Framework for
  learning with inaccurate supervision, which is capable of leveraging label refinement
  to handle inaccurate supervision. Specifically, our framework trains the predictive
  model with refined labels through global detection of reliability and local enhancement
  using an enhanced model fine-tuned by a proposed consistency loss. Also, we theoretically
  justify that the enhanced model in local enhancement can achieve higher accuracy
  than the predictive model on the detected unreliable set under mild assumptions.
