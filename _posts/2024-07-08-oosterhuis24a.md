title: Local Feature Selection without Label or Feature Leakage for Interpretable
  Machine Learning Predictions
openreview: Msjovr9hUe
abstract: Local feature selection in machine learning provides instance-specific explanations
  by focusing on the most relevant features for each prediction, enhancing the interpretability
  of complex models. However, such methods tend to produce misleading explanations
  by encoding additional information in their selections. In this work, we attribute
  the problem of misleading selections by formalizing the concepts of label and feature
  leakage. We rigorously derive the necessary and sufficient conditions under which
  we can guarantee no leakage, and show existing methods do not meet these conditions.
  Furthermore, we propose the first local feature selection method that is proven
  to have no leakage called SUWR. Our experimental results indicate that SUWR is less
  prone to overfitting and combines state-of-the-art predictive performance with high
  feature-selection sparsity. Our generic and easily extendable formal approach provides
  a strong theoretical basis for future work on interpretability with reliable explanations.
