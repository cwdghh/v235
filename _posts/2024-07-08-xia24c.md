title: 'LESS: Selecting Influential Data for Targeted Instruction Tuning'
openreview: PG5fV50maR
abstract: 'Instruction tuning has unlocked powerful capabilities in large language
  models (LLMs), using combined datasets to develop general-purpose chatbots. However,
  real-world applications often require a specialized suite of skills (e.g., reasoning).
  The challenge lies in identifying the most relevant data from these extensive datasets
  to effectively develop specific capabilities, a setting we frame as <em>targeted
  instruction tuning</em>. We propose LESS, an optimizer-aware and practically efficient
  algorithm to estimate data influences and perform <b>L</b>ow-rank gradi<b>E</b>nt
  <b>S</b>imilarity <b>S</b>earch for instruction data selection. Crucially, LESS
  adapts existing influence formulations to work with the Adam optimizer and variable-length
  instruction data. LESS first constructs a highly reusable and transferable <em>gradient
  datastore</em> with low-dimensional gradient features and then selects examples
  based on their similarity to few-shot examples embodying a specific capability.
  Experiments show that training on a LESS-selected 5% of the data can often outperform
  training on the full dataset across diverse downstream tasks. Furthermore, the selected
  data is highly transferable: smaller models can be leveraged to select useful data
  for larger models and models from different families. Our qualitative analysis shows
  that our method goes beyond surface form cues to identify data that exemplifies
  the necessary reasoning skills for the intended downstream application. To facilitate
  future work, we release code and data at princeton-nlp/LESS.'
