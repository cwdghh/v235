title: Dynamic Evaluation of Large Language Models by Meta Probing Agents
openreview: DwTgy1hXXo
abstract: 'Evaluation of large language models (LLMs) has raised great concerns in
  the community due to the issue of data contamination. Existing work designed evaluation
  protocols using well-defined algorithms for specific tasks, which cannot be easily
  extended to diverse scenarios. Moreover, current evaluation benchmarks can only
  provide the overall benchmark results and cannot support a fine-grained and multifaceted
  analysis of LLMsâ€™ abilities. In this paper, we propose meta probing agents (MPA),
  a general dynamic evaluation protocol inspired by psychometrics to evaluate LLMs.
  MPA designs the probing and judging agents to automatically transform an original
  evaluation problem into a new one following psychometric theory on three basic cognitive
  abilities: language understanding, problem solving, and domain knowledge. These
  basic abilities are also dynamically configurable, allowing multifaceted analysis.
  We conducted extensive evaluations using MPA and found that most LLMs achieve poorer
  performance, indicating room for improvement. Our multifaceted analysis demonstrated
  the strong correlation between the basic abilities and an implicit Mattew effect
  on model size, i.e., larger models possess stronger correlations of the abilities.
  MPA can also be used as a data augmentation approach to enhance LLMs. Code is available
