title: Statistical Inference Under Constrained Selection Bias
openreview: CiZN2OATRp
abstract: Large-scale datasets are increasingly being used to inform decision making.
  While this effort aims to ground policy in real-world evidence, challenges have
  arisen as selection bias and other forms of distribution shifts often plague observational
  data. Previous attempts to provide robust inference have given guarantees depending
  on a user-specified amount of possible distribution shift (e.g., the maximum KL
  divergence between the observed and target distributions). However, decision makers
  will often have additional knowledge about the target distribution which constrains
  the kind of possible shifts. To leverage such information, we propose a framework
  that enables statistical inference in the presence of selection bias which obeys
  user-specified constraints in the form of functions whose expectation is known under
  the target distribution. The output is high-probability bounds on the value of an
  estimand for the target distribution. Hence, our method leverages domain knowledge
  in order to partially identify a wide class of estimands. We analyze the computational
  and statistical properties of methods to estimate these bounds and show that our
  method can produce informative bounds on a variety of simulated and semisynthetic
  tasks, as well as in a real-world use case.
