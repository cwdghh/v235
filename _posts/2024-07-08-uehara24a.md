title: Feedback Efficient Online Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Models
openreview: dtVlc9ybTm
abstract: 'Diffusion models excel at modeling complex data distributions, including
  those of images, proteins, and small molecules. However, in many cases, our goal
  is to model parts of the distribution that maximize certain properties: for example,
  we may want to generate images with high aesthetic quality, or molecules with high
  bioactivity. It is natural to frame this as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem,
  in which the objective is to finetune a diffusion model to maximize a reward function
  that corresponds to some property. Even with access to online queries of the ground-truth
  reward function, efficiently discovering high-reward samples can be challenging:
  they might have a low probability in the initial distribution, and there might be
  many infeasible samples that do not even have a well-defined reward (e.g., unnatural
  images or physically impossible molecules). In this work, we propose a novel reinforcement
  learning procedure that efficiently explores on the manifold of feasible samples.
  We present a theoretical analysis providing a regret guarantee, as well as empirical
  validation across three domains: images, biological sequences, and molecules.'
