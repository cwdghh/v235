title: Collaborative Heterogeneous Causal Inference Beyond Meta-analysis
openreview: LJ34pX1U5g
abstract: Collaboration between different data centers is often challenged by heterogeneity
  across sites. To account for the heterogeneity, the state-of-the-art method is to
  re-weight the covariate distributions in each site to match the distribution of
  the target population. Nevertheless, this method still relies on the concept of
  traditional meta-analysis after adjusting for the distribution shift. This work
  proposes a collaborative inverse propensity score weighting estimator for causal
  inference with heterogeneous data. Instead of adjusting the distribution shift separately,
  we use weighted propensity score models to collaboratively adjust for the distribution
  shift. Our method shows significant improvements over the methods based on meta-analysis
  when heterogeneity increases. By incorporating outcome regression models, we prove
  the asymptotic normality when the covariates have dimension $d<8$. Our methods preserve
  privacy at individual sites by implementing federated learning protocols.
