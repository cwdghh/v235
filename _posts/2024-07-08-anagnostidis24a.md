title: 'Navigating Scaling Laws: Compute Optimality in Adaptive Model Training'
openreview: 3KxPo62PYn
abstract: 'In recent years, the state-of-the-art in deep learning has been dominated
  by very large models that have been pre-trained on vast amounts of data. The paradigm
  is very simple: investing more computational resources (optimally) leads to better
  performance, and even predictably so; neural scaling laws have been derived that
  accurately forecast the performance of a network for a desired level of compute.
  This leads to the notion of a ’compute-optimal’ model, i.e. a model that allocates
  a given level of compute during training optimally to maximize performance. In this
  work, we extend the concept of optimality by allowing for an ’adaptive’ model, i.e.
  a model that can change its shape during training. By doing so, we can design adaptive
  models that optimally traverse between the underlying scaling laws and outpace their
  ‘static’ counterparts, leading to a significant reduction in the required compute
  to reach a given target performance. We show that our approach generalizes across
  modalities and different shape parameters.'
