title: On Hypothesis Transfer Learning of Functional Linear Models
openreview: mGsF8Q0fGZ
abstract: 'We study the transfer learning (TL) for the functional linear regression
  (FLR) under the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) framework, observing the
  TL techniques in existing high-dimensional linear regression is not compatible with
  the truncation-based FLR methods as functional data are intrinsically infinite-dimensional
  and generated by smooth underlying processes. We measure the similarity across tasks
  using RKHS distance, allowing the type of information being transferred to be tied
  to the properties of the imposed RKHS. Building on the hypothesis offset transfer
  learning paradigm, two algorithms are proposed: one conducts the transfer when positive
  sources are known, while the other leverages aggregation techniques to achieve robust
  transfer without prior information about the sources. We establish asymptotic lower
  bounds for this learning problem and show the proposed algorithms enjoy a matching
  upper bound. These analyses provide statistical insights into factors that contribute
  to the dynamics of the transfer. We also extend the results to functional generalized
  linear models. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated via
  extensive synthetic data as well as real-world data applications.'
