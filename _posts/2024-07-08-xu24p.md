title: Prompt-guided Precise Audio Editing with Diffusion Models
openreview: kQ1dwuheR0
abstract: Audio editing involves the arbitrary manipulation of audio content through
  precise control. Although text-guided diffusion models have made significant advancements
  in text-to-audio generation, they still face challenges in finding a flexible and
  precise way to modify target events within an audio track. We present a novel approach,
  referred to as <b>PPAE</b>, which serves as a general module for diffusion models
  and enables precise audio editing. The editing is based on the input textual prompt
  only and is entirely training-free. We exploit the cross-attention maps of diffusion
  models to facilitate accurate local editing and employ a hierarchical local-global
  pipeline to ensure a smoother editing process. Experimental results highlight the
  effectiveness of our method in various editing tasks.
