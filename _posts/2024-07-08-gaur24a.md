title: 'Closing the Gap: Achieving Global Convergence (Last Iterate) of Actor-Critic
  under Markovian Sampling with Neural Network Parametrization'
openreview: rJxFvAs7pq
abstract: 'The current state-of-the-art theoretical analysis of Actor-Critic (AC)
  algorithms significantly lags in addressing the practical aspects of AC implementations.
  This crucial gap needs bridging to bring the analysis in line with practical implementations
  of AC. To address this, we advocate for considering the MMCLG criteria: <b>M</b>ulti-layer
  neural network parametrization for actor/critic, <b>M</b>arkovian sampling, <b>C</b>ontinuous
  state-action spaces, the performance of the <b>L</b>ast iterate, and <b>G</b>lobal
  optimality. These aspects are practically significant and have been largely overlooked
  in existing theoretical analyses of AC algorithms. In this work, we address these
  gaps by providing the first comprehensive theoretical analysis of AC algorithms
  that encompasses all five crucial practical aspects (covers MMCLG criteria). We
  establish global convergence sample complexity bounds of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(
  \epsilon^{-3} \right)$. We achieve this result through our novel use of the weak
  gradient domination property of MDPâ€™s and our unique analysis of the error in critic
  estimation.'
