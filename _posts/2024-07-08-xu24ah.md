title: 'Exponential Spectral Pursuit: An Effective Initialization Method for Sparse
  Phase Retrieval'
openreview: U4Yvwu1RQY
abstract: Sparse phase retrieval aims to reconstruct an $n$-dimensional $k$-sparse
  signal from its phaseless measurements. For most of the existing reconstruction
  algorithms, their sampling complexity is known to be dominated by the initialization
  stage. In this paper, in order to improve the sampling complexity for initialization,
  we propose a novel method termed exponential spectral pursuit (ESP). Theoretically,
  our method offers a tighter bound of sampling complexity compared to the state-of-the-art
  ones, such as the truncated power method. Moreover, it empirically outperforms the
  existing initialization methods for sparse phase retrieval.
