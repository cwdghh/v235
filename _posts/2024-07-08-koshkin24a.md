title: 'convSeq: Fast and Scalable Method for Detecting Patterns in Spike Data'
openreview: KVa4i4RR1O
abstract: Spontaneous neural activity, crucial in memory, learning, and spatial navigation,
  often manifests itself as repetitive spatiotemporal patterns. Despite their importance,
  analyzing these patterns in large neural recordings remains challenging due to a
  lack of efficient and scalable detection methods. Addressing this gap, we introduce
  <em>convSeq</em>, an unsupervised method that employs backpropagation for optimizing
  spatiotemporal filters that effectively identify these neural patterns. Our methodâ€™s
  performance is validated on various synthetic data and real neural recordings, revealing
  spike sequences with unprecedented scalability and efficiency. Significantly surpassing
  existing methods in speed, <em>convSeq</em> sets a new standard for analyzing spontaneous
  neural activity, potentially advancing our understanding of information processing
  in neural circuits.
