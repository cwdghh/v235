title: Estimating Canopy Height at Scale
openreview: ZzCY0fRver
abstract: We propose a framework for global-scale canopy height estimation based on
  satellite data. Our model leverages advanced data preprocessing techniques, resorts
  to a novel loss function designed to counter geolocation inaccuracies inherent in
  the ground-truth height measurements, and employs data from the Shuttle Radar Topography
  Mission to effectively filter out erroneous labels in mountainous regions, enhancing
  the reliability of our predictions in those areas. A comparison between predictions
  and ground-truth labels yields an MAE/RMSE of 2.43 / 4.73 (meters) overall and 4.45
  / 6.72 (meters) for trees taller than five meters, which depicts a substantial improvement
  compared to existing global-scale products. The resulting height map as well as
  the underlying framework will facilitate and enhance ecological analyses at a global
  scale, including, but not limited to, large-scale forest and biomass monitoring.
