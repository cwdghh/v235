title: Hyperbolic Optimizer as a Dynamical System
openreview: kZKopcDp2q
abstract: During the last few years, the field of dynamical systems has been developing
  innovative tools to study the asymptotic behavior of different optimizers in the
  context of neural networks. In this work, we redefine an extensively studied optimizer,
  employing classical techniques from hyperbolic geometry. This new definition is
  linked to a non-linear differential equation as a continuous limit. Additionally,
  by utilizing Lyapunov stability concepts, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of
  its critical points.
