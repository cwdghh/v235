title: 'Audio Flamingo: A Novel Audio Language Model with Few-Shot Learning and Dialogue
  Abilities'
openreview: WYi3WKZjYe
abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) to understand audio – including
  non-speech sounds and non-verbal speech – is critically important for diverse real-world
  applications of LLMs. In this paper, we propose Audio Flamingo, a novel audio language
  model with 1) strong audio understanding abilities, 2) the ability to quickly adapt
  to unseen tasks via in-context learning and retrieval, and 3) strong multi-turn
  dialogue abilities. We introduce a series of training techniques, architecture design,
  and data strategies to enhance our model with these abilities. Extensive evaluations
  across various audio understanding tasks confirm the efficacy of our method, setting
  new state-of-the-art benchmarks. Our demo website is https://audioflamingo.github.io/
  and the code is open-sourced at https://github.com/NVIDIA/audio-flamingo.
