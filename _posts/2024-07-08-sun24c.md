title: Representing Molecules as Random Walks Over Interpretable Grammars
openreview: gS3nc9iUrH
abstract: Recent research in molecular discovery has primarily been devoted to small,
  drug-like molecules, leaving many similarly important applications in material design
  without adequate technology. These applications often rely on more complex molecular
  structures with fewer examples that are carefully designed using known substructures.
  We propose a data-efficient and interpretable model for representing and reasoning
  over such molecules in terms of graph grammars that explicitly describe the hierarchical
  design space featuring motifs to be the design basis. We present a novel representation
  in the form of random walks over the design space, which facilitates both molecule
  generation and property prediction. We demonstrate clear advantages over existing
  methods in terms of performance, efficiency, and synthesizability of predicted molecules,
  and we provide detailed insights into the methodâ€™s chemical interpretability.
