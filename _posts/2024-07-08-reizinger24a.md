title: 'Position: Understanding LLMs Requires More Than Statistical Generalization'
openreview: pVyOchWUBa
abstract: 'The last decade has seen blossoming research in deep learning theory attempting
  to answer, “Why does deep learning generalize?" A powerful shift in perspective
  precipitated this progress: the study of overparametrized models in the interpolation
  regime. In this paper, we argue that another perspective shift is due, since some
  of the desirable qualities of LLMs are not a consequence of good statistical generalization
  and require a separate theoretical explanation. Our core argument relies on the
  observation that AR probabilistic models are inherently non-identifiable: models
  zero or near-zero KL divergence apart—thus, equivalent test loss—can exhibit markedly
  different behaviors. We support our position with mathematical examples and empirical
  observations, illustrating why non-identifiability has practical relevance through
  three case studies: (1) the non-identifiability of zero-shot rule extrapolation;
  (2) the approximate non-identifiability of in-context learning; and (3) the non-identifiability
  of fine-tunability. We review promising research directions focusing on LLM-relevant
  generalization measures, transferability, and inductive biases.'
