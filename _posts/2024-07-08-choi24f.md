title: 'PANDA: Expanded Width-Aware Message Passing Beyond Rewiring'
openreview: J1NIXxiDbu
abstract: Recent research in the field of graph neural network (GNN) has identified
  a critical issue known as "over-squashing," resulting from the bottleneck phenomenon
  in graph structures, which impedes the propagation of long-range information. Prior
  works have proposed a variety of graph rewiring concepts that aim at optimizing
  the spatial or spectral properties of graphs to promote the signal propagation.
  However, such approaches inevitably deteriorate the original graph topology, which
  may lead to a distortion of information flow. To address this, we introduce an ex<b>pand</b>ed
  width-<b>a</b>ware (<b>PANDA</b>) message passing, a new message passing paradigm
  where nodes with high centrality, a potential source of over-squashing, are selectively
  expanded in width to encapsulate the growing influx of signals from distant nodes.
  Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing rewiring methods,
  suggesting that selectively expanding the hidden state of nodes can be a compelling
  alternative to graph rewiring for addressing the over-squashing.
