title: 'Planning, Fast and Slow: Online Reinforcement Learning with Action-Free Offline
  Data via Multiscale Planners'
openreview: HwVZbPbMjw
abstract: The surge in volumes of video data offers unprecedented opportunities for
  advancing reinforcement learning (RL). This growth has motivated the development
  of passive RL, seeking to convert passive observations into actionable insights.
  This paper explores the prerequisites and mechanisms through which passive data
  can be utilized to improve online RL. We show that, in identifiable dynamics, where
  action impact can be distinguished from stochasticity, learning on passive data
  is statistically beneficial. Building upon the theoretical insights, we propose
  a novel algorithm named Multiscale State-Centric Planners (MSCP) that leverages
  two planners at distinct scales to offer guidance across varying levels of abstraction.
  The algorithmâ€™s fast planner targets immediate objectives, while the slow planner
  focuses on achieving longer-term goals. Notably, the fast planner incorporates pessimistic
  regularization to address the distributional shift between offline and online data.
  MSCP effectively handles the practical challenges involving imperfect pretraining
  and limited dataset coverage. Our empirical evaluations across multiple benchmarks
  demonstrate that MSCP significantly outperforms existing approaches, underscoring
  its proficiency in addressing complex, long-horizon tasks through the strategic
  use of passive data.
