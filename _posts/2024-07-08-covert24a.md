title: Scaling Laws for the Value of Individual Data Points in Machine Learning
openreview: scSB9RynSd
abstract: 'Recent works have shown that machine learning models improve at a predictable
  rate with the amount of training data, leading to scaling laws that describe the
  relationship between error and dataset size. These scaling laws can help determine
  a model’s training dataset, but they take an aggregate view of the data by only
  considering the dataset’s size. We consider a new perspective by investigating scaling
  behavior for the value of individual data points: we find that a data point’s contribution
  to model’s performance shrinks predictably with the size of the dataset in a log-linear
  manner. Interestingly, there is significant variability in the scaling exponent
  among different data points, indicating that certain points are more valuable in
  small datasets and other points are relatively more useful as a part of large datasets.
  We provide learning theory support for our scaling laws and we observe empirically
  that it holds across several model classes. We further propose a maximum likelihood
  estimator and an amortized estimator to efficiently learn the individualized scaling
  behaviors from a small number of noisy observations per data point. Using our efficient
  estimators, we provide insights into factors that influence the scaling behavior
  of different data points. Finally we demonstrate applications of the individualized
  scaling laws to data valuation and data subset selection.'
