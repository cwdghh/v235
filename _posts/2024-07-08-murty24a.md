title: 'BAGEL: Bootstrapping Agents by Guiding Exploration with Language'
openreview: VsvfSMI5bs
abstract: 'Following natural language instructions by executing actions in digital
  environments (e.g. web-browsers and REST APIs) is a challenging task for language
  model (LM) agents. Unfortunately, LM agents often fail to generalize to new environments
  without human demonstrations. This work presents BAGEL, a method for bootstrapping
  LM agents without human supervision. BAGEL converts a seed set of randomly explored
  trajectories to synthetic demonstrations via round-trips between two noisy LM components:
  an LM labeler which converts a trajectory into a synthetic instruction, and a zero-shot
  LM agent which maps the synthetic instruction into a refined trajectory. By performing
  these round-trips iteratively, BAGEL quickly converts the initial distribution of
  trajectories towards those that are well-described by natural language. We adapt
  the base LM agent at test time with in-context learning by retrieving relevant BAGEL
  demonstrations based on the instruction, and find improvements of over 2-13% absolute
  on ToolQA and MiniWob++, with up to 13x reduction in execution failures.'
