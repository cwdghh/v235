title: 'EMC$^2$: Efficient MCMC Negative Sampling for Contrastive Learning with Global
  Convergence'
openreview: GxOFM3f5Vm
abstract: A key challenge in contrastive learning is to generate negative samples
  from a large sample set to contrast with positive samples, for learning better encoding
  of the data. These negative samples often follow a softmax distribution which are
  dynamically updated during the training process. However, sampling from this distribution
  is non-trivial due to the high computational costs in computing the partition function.
  In this paper, we propose an $\underline{\text{E}}$fficient $\underline{\text{M}}$arkov
  $\underline{\text{C}}$hain Monte Carlo negative sampling method for $\underline{\text{C}}$ontrastive
  learning (EMC$^2$). We follow the global contrastive learning loss as introduced
  in SogCLR, and propose EMC$^2$ which utilizes an adaptive Metropolis-Hastings subroutine
  to generate hardness-aware negative samples in an online fashion during the optimization.
  We prove that EMC$^2$ finds an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$-stationary point of the
  global contrastive loss in $T$ iterations. Compared to prior works, EMC$^2$ is the
  first algorithm that exhibits global convergence (to stationarity) regardless of
  the choice of batch size while exhibiting low computation and memory cost. Numerical
  experiments validate that EMC$^2$ is effective with small batch training and achieves
  comparable or better performance than baseline algorithms. We report the results
  for pre-training image encoders on STL-10 and Imagenet-100.
