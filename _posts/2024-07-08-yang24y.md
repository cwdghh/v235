title: Explain Temporal Black-Box Models via Functional Decomposition
openreview: Uo3LNg5SLY
abstract: How to explain temporal models is a significant challenge due to the inherent
  characteristics of time series data, notably the strong temporal dependencies and
  interactions between observations. Unlike ordinary tabular data, data at different
  time steps in time series usually interact dynamically, forming influential patterns
  that shape the modelâ€™s predictions, rather than only acting in isolation. Existing
  explanatory approaches for time series often overlook these crucial temporal interactions
  by treating time steps as separate entities, leading to a superficial understanding
  of model behavior. To address this challenge, we introduce FDTempExplainer, an innovative
  model-agnostic explanation method based on functional decomposition, tailored to
  unravel the complex interplay within black-box time series models. Our approach
  disentangles the individual contributions from each time step, as well as the aggregated
  influence of their interactions, in a rigorous framework. FDTempExplainer accurately
  measures the strength of interactions, yielding insights that surpass those from
  baseline models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a wide range
  of time series applications, including anomaly detection, classification, and forecasting,
  showing its superior performance to the state-of-the-art algorithms.
