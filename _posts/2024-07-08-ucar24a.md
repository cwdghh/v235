title: Improving Antibody Humanness Prediction using Patent Data
openreview: u26c52rxZC
abstract: We investigate the potential of patent data for improving the antibody humanness
  prediction using a multi-stage, multi-loss training process. Humanness serves as
  a proxy for the immunogenic response to antibody therapeutics, one of the major
  causes of attrition in drug discovery and a challenging obstacle for their use in
  clinical settings. We pose the initial learning stage as a weakly-supervised contrastive-learning
  problem, where each antibody sequence is associated with possibly multiple identifiers
  of function and the objective is to learn an encoder that groups them according
  to their patented properties. We then freeze a part of the contrastive encoder and
  continue training it on the patent data using the cross-entropy loss to predict
  the humanness score of a given antibody sequence. We illustrate the utility of the
  patent data and our approach by performing inference on three different immunogenicity
  datasets, unseen during training. Our empirical results demonstrate that the learned
  model consistently outperforms the alternative baselines and establishes new state-of-the-art
  on five out of six inference tasks, irrespective of the used metric.
