title: 'Position: Towards Unified Alignment Between Agents, Humans, and Environment'
openreview: DzLna0cFL1
abstract: The rapid progress of foundation models has led to the prosperity of autonomous
  agents, which leverage the universal capabilities of foundation models to conduct
  reasoning, decision-making, and environmental interaction. However, the efficacy
  of agents remains limited when operating in intricate, realistic environments. In
  this work, we introduce the principles of <b>U</b>nified <b>A</b>lignment for <b>A</b>gents
  (<b>UA</b>$^2$), which advocate for the simultaneous alignment of agents with human
  intentions, environmental dynamics, and self-constraints such as the limitation
  of monetary budgets. From the perspective of <b>UA</b>$^2$, we review the current
  agent research and highlight the neglected factors in existing agent benchmarks
  and method candidates. We also conduct proof-of-concept studies by introducing realistic
  features to WebShop, including user profiles demonstrating intentions, personalized
  reranking reflecting complex environmental dynamics, and runtime cost statistics
  as self-constraints. We then follow the principles of <b>UA</b>$^2$ to propose an
  initial design of our agent and benchmark its performance with several candidate
  baselines in the retrofitted WebShop. The extensive experimental results further
  prove the importance of the principles of <b>UA</b>$^2$. Our research sheds light
  on the next steps of autonomous agent research with improved general problem-solving
  abilities.
