title: Minimizing $f$-Divergences by Interpolating Velocity Fields
openreview: jvVWPtJYbc
abstract: Many machine learning problems can be seen as approximating a <em>target</em>
  distribution using a <em>particle</em> distribution by minimizing their statistical
  discrepancy. Wasserstein Gradient Flow can move particles along a path that minimizes
  the $f$-divergence between the target and particle distributions. To move particles,
  we need to calculate the corresponding velocity fields derived from a density ratio
  function between these two distributions. Previous works estimated such density
  ratio functions and then differentiated the estimated ratios. These approaches may
  suffer from overfitting, leading to a less accurate estimate of the velocity fields.
  Inspired by non-parametric curve fitting, we directly estimate these velocity fields
  using interpolation techniques. We prove that our estimators are consistent under
  mild conditions. We validate their effectiveness using novel applications on domain
  adaptation and missing data imputation. The code for reproducing our results can
  be found at https://github.com/anewgithubname/gradest2.
