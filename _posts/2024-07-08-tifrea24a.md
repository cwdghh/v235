title: 'FRAPPÉ: A Group Fairness Framework for Post-Processing Everything'
openreview: JndWnomyIc
abstract: Despite achieving promising fairness-error trade-offs, in-processing mitigation
  techniques for group fairness cannot be employed in numerous practical applications
  with limited computation resources or no access to the training pipeline of the
  prediction model. In these situations, post-processing is a viable alternative.
  However, current methods are tailored to specific problem settings and fairness
  definitions and hence, are not as broadly applicable as in-processing. In this work,
  we propose a framework that turns any regularized in-processing method into a post-processing
  approach. This procedure prescribes a way to obtain post-processing techniques for
  a much broader range of problem settings than the prior post-processing literature.
  We show theoretically and through extensive experiments that our framework preserves
  the good fairness-error trade-offs achieved with in-processing and can improve over
  the effectiveness of prior post-processing methods. Finally, we demonstrate several
  advantages of a modular mitigation strategy that disentangles the training of the
  prediction model from the fairness mitigation, including better performance on tasks
  with partial group labels.
