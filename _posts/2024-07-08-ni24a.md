title: 'NExT: Teaching Large Language Models to Reason about Code Execution'
openreview: B1W712hMBi
abstract: A fundamental skill among human developers is the ability to understand
  and reason about program execution. As an example, a programmer can mentally simulate
  code execution in natural language to debug and repair code (aka. rubber duck debugging).
  However, large language models (LLMs) of code are typically trained on the surface
  textual form of programs, thus may lack a semantic understanding of how programs
  execute at run-time. To address this issue, we propose NExT, a method to teach LLMs
  to inspect the execution traces of programs (variable states of executed lines)
  and reason about their run-time behavior through chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales.
  Specifically, NExT uses self-training to bootstrap a synthetic training set of execution-aware
  rationales that lead to correct task solutions (e.g., fixed programs) without laborious
  manual annotation. Experiments on program repair tasks based on MBPP and HumanEval
  demonstrate that NExT improves the fix rate of a PaLM 2 model, by 26.1% and 10.3%
  absolute, respectively, with significantly improved rationale quality as verified
  by automated metrics and human raters. Our model can also generalize to scenarios
  where program traces are absent at test-time.
