title: 'BetterV: Controlled Verilog Generation with Discriminative Guidance'
openreview: jKnW7r7de1
abstract: Due to the growing complexity of modern Integrated Circuits (ICs), there
  is a need for automated circuit design methods. Recent years have seen increasing
  research in hardware design language generation to facilitate the design process.
  In this work, we propose a Verilog generation framework, BetterV, which fine-tunes
  large language models (LLMs) on processed domain-specific datasets and incorporates
  generative discriminators for guidance on particular design demands. Verilog modules
  are collected, filtered, and processed from the internet to form a clean and abundant
  dataset. Instruct-tuning methods are specially designed to fine-tune the LLMs to
  understand knowledge about Verilog. Furthermore, data are augmented to enrich the
  training set and are also used to train a generative discriminator on particular
  downstream tasks, providing guidance for the LLMs to optimize Verilog implementation.
  BetterV has the ability to generate syntactically and functionally correct Verilog,
  outperforming GPT-4 on the VerilogEval benchmark. With the help of task-specific
  generative discriminators, BetterV achieves remarkable improvements on various electronic
  design automation (EDA) downstream tasks, including netlist node reduction for synthesis
  and verification runtime reduction with Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solving.
