title: On Multi-Armed Bandit with Impatient Arms
openreview: j35VcooKG8
abstract: In this paper, we investigate a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) setting where an
  arm exits the game if the algorithm continuously neglects it. This setup is motivated
  by real-world scenarios, such as online advertising and crowdsourcing, where arms
  only gain benefits after being pulled by the algorithm. We identify the intrinsic
  hardness of this problem and limitations in existing approaches. We propose FC-SE
  algorithm with expected regret upper bounds as our solution to this problem. As
  an extension, we even allow new arms to enter after the game starts and design FC-Entry
  algorithm with performance guarantees for this setup. Finally, we conduct experiments
  to validate our theoretical results.
