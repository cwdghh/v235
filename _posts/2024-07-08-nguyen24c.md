title: 'PARCv2: Physics-aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks for Spatiotemporal
  Dynamics Modeling'
openreview: T0zR4mdSce
abstract: Modeling unsteady, fast transient, and advection-dominated physics problems
  is a pressing challenge for physics-aware deep learning (PADL). The physics of complex
  systems is governed by large systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) and
  ancillary constitutive models with nonlinear structures, as well as evolving state
  fields exhibiting sharp gradients and rapidly deforming material interfaces. Here,
  we investigate an inductive bias approach that is versatile and generalizable to
  model generic nonlinear field evolution problems. Our study focuses on the recent
  physics-aware recurrent convolutions (PARC), which incorporates a differentiator-integrator
  architecture that inductively models the spatiotemporal dynamics of generic physical
  systems. We extend the capabilities of PARC to simulate unsteady, transient, and
  advection-dominant systems. The extended model, referred to as PARCv2, is equipped
  with differential operators to model advection-reaction-diffusion equations, as
  well as a hybrid integral solver for stable, long-time predictions. PARCv2 is tested
  on both standard benchmark problems in fluid dynamics, namely Burgers and Navier-Stokes
  equations, and then applied to more complex shock-induced reaction problems in energetic
  materials. We evaluate the behavior of PARCv2 in comparison to other physics-informed
  and learning bias models and demonstrate its potential to model unsteady and advection-dominant
  dynamics regimes.
