title: Translation Equivariant Transformer Neural Processes
openreview: pftXzp6Yn3
abstract: 'The effectiveness of neural processes (NPs) in modelling posterior prediction
  maps—the mapping from data to posterior predictive distributions—has significantly
  improved since their inception. This improvement can be attributed to two principal
  factors: (1) advancements in the architecture of permutation invariant set functions,
  which are intrinsic to all NPs; and (2) leveraging symmetries present in the true
  posterior predictive map, which are problem dependent. Transformers are a notable
  development in permutation invariant set functions, and their utility within NPs
  has been demonstrated through the family of models we refer to as TNPs. Despite
  significant interest in TNPs, little attention has been given to incorporating symmetries.
  Notably, the posterior prediction maps for data that are stationary—a common assumption
  in spatio-temporal modelling—exhibit translation equivariance. In this paper, we
  introduce of a new family of translation equivariant TNPs that incorporate <em>translation
  equivariance</em>. Through an extensive range of experiments on synthetic and real-world
  spatio-temporal data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TE-TNPs relative to their
  non-translation-equivariant counterparts and other NP baselines.'
