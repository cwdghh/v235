title: A Circuit Domain Generalization Framework for Efficient Logic Synthesis in
  Chip Design
openreview: 1KemC8DNa0
abstract: Logic Synthesis (LS) plays a vital role in chip design. A key task in LS
  is to simplify circuits—modeled by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)—with functionality-equivalent
  transformations. To tackle this task, many LS heuristics apply transformations to
  subgraphs—rooted at each node on an input DAG—sequentially. However, we found that
  a large number of transformations are ineffective, which makes applying these heuristics
  highly time-consuming. In particular, we notice that the runtime of the Resub and
  Mfs2 heuristics often dominates the overall runtime of LS optimization processes.
  To address this challenge, we propose a novel data-driven LS heuristic paradigm,
  namely PruneX, to reduce ineffective transformations. The major challenge of developing
  PruneX is to learn models that well generalize to unseen circuits, i.e., the out-of-distribution
  (OOD) generalization problem. Thus, the major technical contribution of PruneX is
  the novel circuit domain generalization framework, which learns domain-invariant
  representations based on the transformation-invariant domain-knowledge. To the best
  of our knowledge, PruneX is the first approach to tackle the OOD problem in LS heuristics.
  We integrate PruneX with the aforementioned Resub and Mfs2 heuristics. Experiments
  demonstrate that PruneX significantly improves their efficiency while keeping comparable
  optimization performance on industrial and very large-scale circuits, achieving
  up to $3.1\times$ faster runtime.
