title: On Mechanistic Knowledge Localization in Text-to-Image Generative Models
openreview: fsVBsxjRER
abstract: Identifying layers within text-to-image models which control visual attributes
  can facilitate efficient model editing through closed-form updates. Recent work,
  leveraging causal tracing show that early Stable-Diffusion variants confine knowledge
  primarily to the first layer of the CLIP text-encoder, while it diffuses throughout
  the UNet. Extending this framework, we observe that for recent models (e.g., SD-XL,
  DeepFloyd), causal tracing fails in pinpointing localized knowledge, highlighting
  challenges in model editing. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of
  mechanistic localization in text-to-image models, where knowledge about various
  visual attributes (e.g., "style", "objects", "facts") can be mechanistically localized
  to a small fraction of layers in the UNet, thus facilitating efficient model editing.
  We localize knowledge using our method LocoGen which measures the direct effect
  of intermediate layers to output generation by performing interventions in the cross-attention
  layers of the UNet. We then employ LocoEdit, a fast closed-form editing method across
  popular open-source text-to-image models (including the latest SD-XL) and explore
  the possibilities of neuron-level model editing. Using mechanistic localization,
  our work offers a better view of successes and failures in localization-based text-to-image
  model editing.
