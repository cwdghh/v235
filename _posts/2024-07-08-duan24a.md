title: 'MuxServe: Flexible Spatial-Temporal Multiplexing for Multiple LLM Serving'
openreview: R0SoZvqXyQ
abstract: 'Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance,
  and organizations are racing to serve LLMs of varying sizes as endpoints for use-cases
  like chat, programming and search. However, efficiently serving multiple LLMs poses
  significant challenges for existing approaches due to varying popularity of LLMs.
  In the paper, we present MuxServe, a flexible spatial-temporal multiplexing system
  for efficient multiple LLM serving. The key insight behind is to colocate LLMs considering
  their popularity to multiplex memory resources, and leverage the characteristics
  of prefill and decoding phases to separate and flexibly colocate them to multiplex
  computation resources. MuxServe formally formulates the multiplexing problem, and
  proposes a novel placement algorithm and adaptive batch scheduling strategy to identify
  optimal colocations and maximize utilization. MuxServe designs a unified resource
  manager to enable flexible and efficient multiplexing. Evaluation results show that
  MuxServe can achieves up to $1.8\times$ higher throughput or processes $2.9\times$
  more requests within $99%$ SLO attainment. The code is available at: https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/MuxServe.'
