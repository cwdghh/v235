title: 'Sample as you Infer: Predictive Coding with Langevin Dynamics'
openreview: 6VQXLUy4sQ
abstract: We present Langevin Predictive Coding (LPC), a novel algorithm for deep
  generative model learning that builds upon the predictive coding framework of computational
  neuroscience. By injecting Gaussian noise into the predictive coding inference procedure
  and incorporating an encoder network initialization, we reframe the approach as
  an amortized Langevin sampling method for optimizing a tight variational lower bound.
  To increase robustness to sampling step size, we present a lightweight preconditioning
  technique inspired by Riemannian Langevin methods and adaptive SGD. We compare LPC
  against VAEs by training generative models on benchmark datasets; our experiments
  demonstrate superior sample quality and faster convergence for LPC in a fraction
  of SGD training iterations, while matching or exceeding VAE performance across key
  metrics like FID, diversity and coverage.
