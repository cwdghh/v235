title: Finite Smoothing Algorithm for High-Dimensional Support Vector Machines and
  Quantile Regression
openreview: RvwMTDYTOb
abstract: 'This paper introduces a finite smoothing algorithm (FSA), a novel approach
  to tackle computational challenges in applying support vector machines (SVM) and
  quantile regression to high-dimensional data. The critical issue with these methods
  is the non-smooth nature of their loss functions, which traditionally limits the
  use of highly efficient coordinate descent techniques in high-dimensional settings.
  FSA innovatively addresses this issue by transforming these loss functions into
  their smooth counterparts, thereby facilitating more efficient computation. A distinctive
  feature of FSA is its theoretical foundation: FSA can yield exact solutions, not
  just approximations, despite the smoothing approach. Our simulation and benchmark
  tests demonstrate that FSA significantly outpaces its competitors in speed, often
  by orders of magnitude, while improving or at least maintaining precision. We have
  implemented FSA in two open-source R packages: hdsvm for high-dimensional SVM and
  hdqr for high-dimensional quantile regression.'
