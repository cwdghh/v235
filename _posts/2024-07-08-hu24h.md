title: 'InfoNet: Neural Estimation of Mutual Information without Test-Time Optimization'
openreview: 40hCy8n5XH
abstract: Estimating mutual correlations between random variables or data streams
  is essential for intelligent behavior and decision-making. As a fundamental quantity
  for measuring statistical relationships, mutual information has been extensively
  studied and utilized for its generality and equitability. However, existing methods
  often lack the efficiency needed for real-time applications, such as test-time optimization
  of a neural network, or the differentiability required for end-to-end learning,
  like histograms. We introduce a neural network called InfoNet, which directly outputs
  mutual information estimations of data streams by leveraging the attention mechanism
  and the computational efficiency of deep learning infrastructures. By maximizing
  a dual formulation of mutual information through large-scale simulated training,
  our approach circumvents time-consuming test-time optimization and offers generalization
  ability. We evaluate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed mutual
  information estimation scheme on various families of distributions and applications.
  Our results demonstrate that InfoNet and its training process provide a graceful
  efficiency-accuracy trade-off and order-preserving properties. We will make the
  code and models available as a comprehensive toolbox to facilitate studies in different
  fields requiring real-time mutual information estimation.
