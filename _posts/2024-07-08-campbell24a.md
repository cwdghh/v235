title: 'Generative Flows on Discrete State-Spaces: Enabling Multimodal Flows with
  Applications to Protein Co-Design'
openreview: kQwSbv0BR4
abstract: Combining discrete and continuous data is an important capability for generative
  models. We present Discrete Flow Models (DFMs), a new flow-based model of discrete
  data that provides the missing link in enabling flow-based generative models to
  be applied to multimodal continuous and discrete data problems. Our key insight
  is that the discrete equivalent of continuous space flow matching can be realized
  using Continuous Time Markov Chains. DFMs benefit from a simple derivation that
  includes discrete diffusion models as a specific instance while allowing improved
  performance over existing diffusion-based approaches. We utilize our DFMs method
  to build a multimodal flow-based modeling framework. We apply this capability to
  the task of protein co-design, wherein we learn a model for jointly generating protein
  structure and sequence. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art co-design performance
  while allowing the same multimodal model to be used for flexible generation of the
  sequence or structure.
