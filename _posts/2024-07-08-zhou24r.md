title: Language Agent Tree Search Unifies Reasoning, Acting, and Planning in Language
  Models
openreview: njwv9BsGHF
abstract: While language models (LMs) have shown potential across a range of decision-making
  tasks, their reliance on simple acting processes limits their broad deployment as
  autonomous agents. In this paper, we introduce Language Agent Tree Search (LATS)
  â€“ the first general framework that synergizes the capabilities of LMs in reasoning,
  acting, and planning. By leveraging the in-context learning ability of LMs, we integrate
  Monte Carlo Tree Search into LATS to enable LMs as agents, along with LM-powered
  value functions and self-reflections for proficient exploration and enhanced decision-making.
  A key feature of our approach is the incorporation of an environment for external
  feedback, which offers a more deliberate and adaptive problem-solving mechanism
  that surpasses the constraints of existing techniques. Our experimental evaluation
  across diverse domains, including programming, interactive question-answering (QA),
  web navigation, and math, validates the effectiveness and generality of LATS in
  decision-making while maintaining competitive or improved reasoning performance.
  Notably, LATS achieves state-of-the-art pass@1 accuracy (92.7%) for programming
  on HumanEval with GPT-4 and demonstrates gradient-free performance (average score
  of 75.9) comparable to gradient-based fine-tuning for web navigation on WebShop
  with GPT-3.5. Code can be found at https://github.com/lapisrocks/LanguageAgentTreeSearch
