title: 'Identifiability Matters: Revealing the Hidden Recoverable Condition in Unbiased
  Learning to Rank'
openreview: JU3xHh1vWw
abstract: 'Unbiased Learning to Rank (ULTR) aims to train unbiased ranking models
  from biased click logs, by explicitly modeling a generation process for user behavior
  and fitting click data based on examination hypothesis. Previous research found
  empirically that the true latent relevance is mostly recoverable through click fitting.
  However, we demonstrate that this is not always achievable, resulting in a significant
  reduction in ranking performance. This research investigates the conditions under
  which relevance can be recovered from click data in the first principle. We initially
  characterize a ranking model as identifiable if it can recover the true relevance
  up to a scaling transformation, a criterion sufficient for the pairwise ranking
  objective. Subsequently, we investigate an equivalent condition for identifiability,
  articulated as a graph connectivity test problem: the recovery of relevance is feasible
  if and only if the identifiability graph (IG), derived from the underlying structure
  of the dataset, is connected. The presence of a disconnected IG may lead to degenerate
  cases and suboptimal ranking performance. To tackle this challenge, we introduce
  two methods, namely node intervention and node merging, designed to modify the dataset
  and restore the connectivity of the IG. Empirical results derived from a simulated
  dataset and two real-world LTR benchmark datasets not only validate our proposed
  theory, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in alleviating data
  bias when the relevance model is unidentifiable.'
