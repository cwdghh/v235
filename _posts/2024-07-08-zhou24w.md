title: Exploring Training on Heterogeneous Data with Mixture of Low-rank Adapters
openreview: NQ6KDfSDFK
abstract: 'Training a unified model to take multiple targets into account is a trend
  towards artificial general intelligence. However, how to efficiently mitigate the
  training conflicts among heterogeneous data collected from different domains or
  tasks remains under-explored. In this study, we explore to leverage Mixture of Low-rank
  Adapters (MoLA) to mitigate conflicts in heterogeneous data training, which requires
  to jointly train the multiple low-rank adapters and their shared backbone. Specifically,
  we introduce two variants of MoLA, namely, MoLA-Grad and MoLA-Router, to respectively
  handle the target-aware and target-agnostic scenarios during inference. The former
  uses task identifiers to assign personalized low-rank adapters to each task, disentangling
  task-specific knowledge towards their adapters, thereby mitigating heterogeneity
  conflicts. The latter uses a novel Task-wise Decorrelation (TwD) loss to intervene
  the router to learn oriented weight combinations of adapters to homogeneous tasks,
  achieving similar effects. We conduct comprehensive experiments to verify the superiority
  of MoLA over previous state-of-the-art methods and present in-depth analysis on
  its working mechanism. Source code is available at: https://github.com/MediaBrain-SJTU/MoLA'
