  and Graph Convolutional Networks'
openreview: 8m4V6Fx6ma
abstract: We delve into the challenge of semi-supervised node classification on the
  Contextual Stochastic Block Model (CSBM) dataset. Here, nodes from the two-cluster
  Stochastic Block Model (SBM) are coupled with feature vectors, which are derived
  from a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) that corresponds to their respective node labels.
  With only a subset of the CSBM node labels accessible for training, our primary
  objective becomes the accurate classification of the remaining nodes. Venturing
  into the transductive learning landscape, we, for the first time, pinpoint the information-theoretical
  threshold for the exact recovery of all test nodes in CSBM. Concurrently, we design
  an optimal spectral estimator inspired by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with
  the training labels and essential data from both the adjacency matrix and feature
  vectors. We also evaluate the efficacy of graph ridge regression and Graph Convolutional
  Networks (GCN) on this synthetic dataset. Our findings underscore that graph ridge
  regression and GCN possess the ability to achieve the information threshold of exact
  recovery in a manner akin to the optimal estimator when using the optimal weighted
  self-loops. This highlights the potential role of feature learning in augmenting
  the proficiency of GCN, especially in the realm of semi-supervised learning.
