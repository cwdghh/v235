title: 'AnyTool: Self-Reflective, Hierarchical Agents for Large-Scale API Calls'
openreview: qFILbkTQWw
abstract: 'We introduce AnyTool, a large language model agent designed to revolutionize
  the utilization of a vast array of tools in addressing user queries. We utilize
  over 16,000 APIs from Rapid API, operating under the assumption that a subset of
  these APIs could potentially resolve the queries. AnyTool primarily incorporates
  three elements: an API retriever with a hierarchical structure, a solver aimed at
  resolving user queries using a selected set of API candidates, and a self-reflection
  mechanism, which re-activates AnyTool if the initial solution proves impracticable.
  AnyTool is powered by the function calling feature of GPT-4, eliminating the need
  for training external modules. We also revisit the evaluation protocol introduced
  by previous works and identify a limitation in this protocol that leads to an artificially
  high pass rate. By revising the evaluation protocol to better reflect practical
  application scenarios, we introduce an additional benchmark, termed AnyToolBench.
  Experiments across various datasets demonstrate the superiority of our AnyTool over
  strong baselines such as ToolLLM and a GPT-4 variant tailored for tool utilization.
  For instance, AnyTool outperforms ToolLLM by +35.5% in terms of average pass rate
  on ToolBench.'
