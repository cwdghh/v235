title: Generative Modeling on Manifolds Through Mixture of Riemannian Diffusion Processes
openreview: 60HydCpCMZ
abstract: Learning the distribution of data on Riemannian manifolds is crucial for
  modeling data from non-Euclidean space, which is required by many applications in
  diverse scientific fields. Yet, existing generative models on manifolds suffer from
  expensive divergence computation or rely on approximations of heat kernel. These
  limitations restrict their applicability to simple geometries and hinder scalability
  to high dimensions. In this work, we introduce the Riemannian Diffusion Mixture,
  a principled framework for building a generative diffusion process on manifolds.
  Instead of following the denoising approach of previous diffusion models, we construct
  a diffusion process using a mixture of bridge processes derived on general manifolds
  without requiring heat kernel estimations. We develop a geometric understanding
  of the mixture process, deriving the drift as a weighted mean of tangent directions
  to the data points that guides the process toward the data distribution. We further
  propose a scalable training objective for learning the mixture process that readily
  applies to general manifolds. Our method achieves superior performance on diverse
  manifolds with dramatically reduced number of in-training simulation steps for general
  manifolds.
