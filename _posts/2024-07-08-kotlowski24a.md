title: A General Online Algorithm for Optimizing Complex Performance Metrics
openreview: pfnBLXgFVS
abstract: We consider sequential maximization of performance metrics that are general
  functions of a confusion matrix of a classifier (such as precision, F-measure, or
  G-mean). Such metrics are, in general, non-decomposable over individual instances,
  making their optimization very challenging. While they have been extensively studied
  under different frameworks in the batch setting, their analysis in the online learning
  regime is very limited, with only a few distinguished exceptions. In this paper,
  we introduce and analyze a general online algorithm that can be used in a straightforward
  way with a variety of complex performance metrics in binary, multi-class, and multi-label
  classification problems. The algorithmâ€™s update and prediction rules are appealingly
  simple and computationally efficient without the need to store any past data. We
  show the algorithm attains $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\ln n}{n})$ regret for concave and
  smooth metrics and verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in empirical
  studies.
