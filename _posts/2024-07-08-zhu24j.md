title: Antibody Design Using a Score-based Diffusion Model Guided by Evolutionary,
  Physical and Geometric Constraints
openreview: 1YsQI04KaN
abstract: Antibodies are central proteins in adaptive immune responses, responsible
  for protecting against viruses and other pathogens. Rational antibody design has
  proven effective in the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases like cancers
  and virus infections. While recent diffusion-based generative models show promise
  in designing antigen-specific antibodies, the primary challenge lies in the scarcity
  of labeled antibody-antigen complex data and binding affinity data. We present AbX,
  a new score-based diffusion generative model guided by evolutionary, physical, and
  geometric constraints for antibody design. These constraints serve to narrow the
  search space and provide priors for plausible antibody sequences and structures.
  Specifically, we leverage a pre-trained protein language model as priors for evolutionary
  plausible antibodies and introduce additional training objectives for geometric
  and physical constraints like van der Waals forces. Furthermore, as far as we know,
  AbX is the first score-based diffusion model with continuous timesteps for antibody
  design, jointly modeling the discrete sequence space and the $\mathrm{SE}(3)$ structure
  space. Evaluated on two independent testing sets, we show that AbX outperforms other
  published methods, achieving higher accuracy in sequence and structure generation
  and enhanced antibody-antigen binding affinity. Ablation studies highlight the clear
  contributions of the introduced constraints to antibody design.
