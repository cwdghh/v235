title: 'DRED: Zero-Shot Transfer in Reinforcement Learning via Data-Regularised Environment
  Design'
openreview: uku9r6RROl
abstract: Autonomous agents trained using deep reinforcement learning (RL) often lack
  the ability to successfully generalise to new environments, even when these environments
  share characteristics with the ones they have encountered during training. In this
  work, we investigate how the sampling of individual environment instances, or levels,
  affects the zero-shot generalisation (ZSG) ability of RL agents. We discover that,
  for deep actor-critic architectures sharing their base layers, prioritising levels
  according to their value loss minimises the mutual information between the agentâ€™s
  internal representation and the set of training levels in the generated training
  data. This provides a novel theoretical justification for the regularisation achieved
  by certain adaptive sampling strategies. We then turn our attention to unsupervised
  environment design (UED) methods, which assume control over level generation. We
  find that existing UED methods can significantly shift the training distribution,
  which translates to low ZSG performance. To prevent both overfitting and distributional
  shift, we introduce <em>data-regularised environment design</em> (DRED). DRED generates
  levels using a generative model trained to approximate the ground truth distribution
  of an initial set of level parameters. Through its grounding, DRED achieves significant
  improvements in ZSG over adaptive level sampling strategies and UED methods.
