title: Score-Based Causal Discovery of Latent Variable Causal Models
openreview: ZdSe1qnuia
abstract: Identifying latent variables and the causal structure involving them is
  essential across various scientific fields. While many existing works fall under
  the category of constraint-based methods (with e.g. conditional independence or
  rank deficiency tests), they may face empirical challenges such as testing-order
  dependency, error propagation, and choosing an appropriate significance level. These
  issues can potentially be mitigated by properly designed score-based methods, such
  as Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) (Chickering, 2002) in the specific setting without
  latent variables. Yet, formulating score-based methods with latent variables is
  highly challenging. In this work, we develop score-based methods that are capable
  of identifying causal structures containing causally-related latent variables with
  identifiability guarantees. Specifically, we show that a properly formulated scoring
  function can achieve score equivalence and consistency for structure learning of
  latent variable causal models. We further provide a characterization of the degrees
  of freedom for the marginal over the observed variables under multiple structural
  assumptions considered in the literature, and accordingly develop both exact and
  continuous score-based methods. This offers a unified view of several existing constraint-based
  methods with different structural assumptions. Experimental results validate the
  effectiveness of the proposed methods.
