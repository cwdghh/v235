title: Two Tales of Single-Phase Contrastive Hebbian Learning
openreview: ui8ewXg1hV
abstract: The search for "biologically plausible" learning algorithms has converged
  on the idea of representing gradients as activity differences. However, most approaches
  require a high degree of synchronization (distinct phases during learning) and introduce
  substantial computational overhead, which raises doubts regarding their biological
  plausibility as well as their potential utility for neuromorphic computing. Furthermore,
  they commonly rely on applying infinitesimal perturbations (nudges) to output units,
  which is impractical in noisy environments. Recently it has been shown that by modelling
  artificial neurons as dyads with two oppositely nudged compartments, it is possible
  for a fully local learning algorithm named “dual propagation” to bridge the performance
  gap to backpropagation, without requiring separate learning phases or infinitesimal
  nudging. However, the algorithm has the drawback that its numerical stability relies
  on symmetric nudging, which may be restrictive in biological and analog implementations.
  In this work we first provide a solid foundation for the objective underlying the
  dual propagation method, which also reveals a surpising connection with adversarial
  robustness. Second, we demonstrate how dual propagation is related to a particular
  adjoint state method, which is stable regardless of asymmetric nudging.
