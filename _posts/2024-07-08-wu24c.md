title: Adaptive Accompaniment with ReaLchords
openreview: mUVydzrkgz
abstract: Jamming requires coordination, anticipation, and collaborative creativity
  between musicians. Current generative models of music produce expressive output
  but are not able to generate in an online manner, meaning simultaneously with other
  musicians (human or otherwise). We propose ReaLchords, an online generative model
  for improvising chord accompaniment to user melody. We start with an online model
  pretrained by maximum likelihood, and use reinforcement learning to finetune the
  model for online use. The finetuning objective leverages both a novel reward model
  that provides feedback on both harmonic and temporal coherency between melody and
  chord, and a divergence term that implements a novel type of distillation from a
  teacher model that can see the future melody. Through quantitative experiments and
  listening tests, we demonstrate that the resulting model adapts well to unfamiliar
  input and produce fitting accompaniment. ReaLchords opens the door to live jamming,
  as well as simultaneous co-creation in other modalities.
