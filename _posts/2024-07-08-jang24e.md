title: Efficient Low-Rank Matrix Estimation, Experimental Design, and Arm-Set-Dependent
  Low-Rank Bandits
openreview: SAEUO7847g
abstract: We study low-rank matrix trace regression and the related problem of low-rank
  matrix bandits. Assuming access to the distribution of the covariates, we propose
  a novel low-rank matrix estimation method called <em>LowPopArt</em> and provide
  its recovery guarantee that depends on a novel quantity denoted by $B(Q)$ that characterizes
  the hardness of the problem, where $Q$ is the covariance matrix of the measurement
  distribution. We show that our method can provide tighter recovery guarantees than
  classical nuclear norm penalized least squares (Koltchinskii et al., 2011) in several
  problems. To perform an efficient estimation with a limited number of measurements
  from an arbitrarily given measurement set $\mathcal{A}$, we also propose a novel
  experimental design criterion that minimizes $B(Q)$ with computational efficiency.
  We leverage our novel estimator and design of experiments to derive two low-rank
  linear bandit algorithms for general arm sets that enjoy improved regret upper bounds.
  This improves over previous works on low-rank bandits, which make somewhat restrictive
  assumptions that the arm set is the unit ball or that an efficient exploration distribution
  is given. To our knowledge, our experimental design criterion is the first one tailored
  to low-rank matrix estimation beyond the naive reduction to linear regression, which
  can be of independent interest.
