title: Privacy-Preserving Data Release Leveraging Optimal Transport and Particle Gradient
  Descent
openreview: 4zN9tvZfns
abstract: We present a novel approach for differentially private data synthesis of
  protected tabular datasets, a relevant task in highly sensitive domains such as
  healthcare and government. Current state-of-the-art methods predominantly use marginal-based
  approaches, where a dataset is generated from private estimates of the marginals.
  In this paper, we introduce PrivPGD, a new generation method for marginal-based
  private data synthesis, leveraging tools from optimal transport and particle gradient
  descent. Our algorithm outperforms existing methods on a large range of datasets
  while being highly scalable and offering the flexibility to incorporate additional
  domain-specific constraints.
