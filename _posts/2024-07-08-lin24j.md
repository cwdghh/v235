title: Selecting Large Language Model to Fine-tune via Rectified Scaling Law
openreview: Bq2THeNXRr
abstract: The ever-growing ecosystem of LLMs has posed a challenge in selecting the
  most appropriate pre-trained model to fine-tune amidst a sea of options. Given constrained
  resources, fine-tuning all models and making selections afterward is unrealistic.
  In this work, we formulate this resource-constrained selection task into predicting
  fine-tuning performance and illustrate its natural connection with Scaling Law.
  Unlike pre-training, we find that the fine-tuning scaling curve includes not just
  the well-known "power phase" but also the previously unobserved "pre-power phase".
  We also explain why existing Scaling Law fails to capture this phase transition
  phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. To address this, we introduce the
  concept of "pre-learned data size" into our Rectified Scaling Law, which overcomes
  theoretical limitations and fits experimental results much better. By leveraging
  our law, we propose a novel LLM selection algorithm that selects the near-optimal
  model with hundreds of times less resource consumption, while other methods may
  provide negatively correlated selection. The project page is available at rectified-scaling-law.github.io.
