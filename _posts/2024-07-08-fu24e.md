title: Language-guided Skill Learning with Temporal Variational Inference
openreview: awo5H10K6v
abstract: We present an algorithm for skill discovery from expert demonstrations.
  The algorithm first utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to propose an initial
  segmentation of the trajectories. Following that, a hierarchical variational inference
  framework incorporates the LLM-generated segmentation information to discover reusable
  skills by merging trajectory segments. To further control the trade-off between
  compression and reusability, we introduce a novel auxiliary objective based on the
  Minimum Description Length principle that helps guide this skill discovery process.
  Our results demonstrate that agents equipped with our method are able to discover
  skills that help accelerate learning and outperform baseline skill learning approaches
  on new long-horizon tasks in BabyAI, a grid world navigation environment, as well
  as ALFRED, a household simulation environment.
