title: Evaluation of LLMs on Syntax-Aware Code Fill-in-the-Middle Tasks
openreview: jKYyFbH8ap
abstract: We introduce <b>S</b>yntax-<b>A</b>ware <b>F</b>ill-<b>i</b>n-the-<b>M</b>iddle
  (SAFIM), a new benchmark for evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on the code
  Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) task. This benchmark focuses on syntax-aware completions
  of program structures such as code blocks and conditional expressions, and includes
  17,720 examples from multiple programming languages, sourced from recent code submissions
  after April 2022 to minimize data contamination. SAFIM provides a robust framework
  with various prompt designs and novel syntax-aware post-processing techniques, facilitating
  accurate and fair comparisons across LLMs. Our comprehensive evaluation of 15 LLMs
  shows that FIM pretraining not only enhances FIM proficiency but also improves Left-to-Right
  (L2R) inference using LLMs. Our findings challenge conventional beliefs and suggest
  that pretraining methods and data quality have more impact than model size. SAFIM
  thus serves as a foundational platform for future research in effective pretraining
  strategies for code LLMs. The evaluation toolkit and dataset are available at https://github.com/gonglinyuan/safim,
  and the leaderboard is available at https://safimbenchmark.com.
