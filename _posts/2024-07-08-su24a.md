title: Learning from Streaming Data when Users Choose
openreview: qLZ32oS7j2
abstract: In digital markets comprised of many competing services, each user chooses
  between multiple service providers according to their preferences, and the chosen
  service makes use of the user data to incrementally improve its model. The service
  providers’ models influence which service the user will choose at the next time
  step, and the user’s choice, in return, influences the model update, leading to
  a feedback loop. In this paper, we formalize the above dynamics and develop a simple
  and efficient decentralized algorithm to locally minimize the overall user loss.
  Theoretically, we show that our algorithm asymptotically converges to stationary
  points of of the overall loss almost surely. We also experimentally demonstrate
  the utility of our algorithm with real world data.
