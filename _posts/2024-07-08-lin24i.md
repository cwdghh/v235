title: Equivariance via Minimal Frame Averaging for More Symmetries and Efficiency
openreview: guFsTBXsov
abstract: We consider achieving equivariance in machine learning systems via frame
  averaging. Current frame averaging methods involve a costly sum over large frames
  or rely on sampling-based approaches that only yield approximate equivariance. Here,
  we propose Minimal Frame Averaging (MFA), a mathematical framework for constructing
  provably minimal frames that are exactly equivariant. The general foundations of
  MFA also allow us to extend frame averaging to more groups than previously considered,
  including the Lorentz group for describing symmetries in space-time, and the unitary
  group for complex-valued domains. Results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness
  of encoding symmetries via MFA across a diverse range of tasks, including $n$-body
  simulation, top tagging in collider physics, and relaxed energy prediction. Our
  code is available at https://github.com/divelab/MFA.
