title: Understanding Stochastic Natural Gradient Variational Inference
openreview: l8GrPpsZfy
abstract: Stochastic natural gradient variational inference (NGVI) is a popular posterior
  inference method with applications in various probabilistic models. Despite its
  wide usage, little is known about the non-asymptotic convergence rate in the <em>stochastic</em>
  setting. We aim to lessen this gap and provide a better understanding. For conjugate
  likelihoods, we prove the first $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{T})$ non-asymptotic convergence
  rate of stochastic NGVI. The complexity is no worse than stochastic gradient descent
  (a.k.a. black-box variational inference) and the rate likely has better constant
  dependency that leads to faster convergence in practice. For non-conjugate likelihoods,
  we show that stochastic NGVI with the canonical parameterization implicitly optimizes
  a non-convex objective. Thus, a global convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{T})$
  is unlikely without some significant new understanding of optimizing the ELBO using
  natural gradients.
