title: Mean Estimation in the Add-Remove Model of Differential Privacy
openreview: cwIhvoTzuK
abstract: 'Differential privacy is often studied under two different models of neighboring
  datasets: the add-remove model and the swap model. While the swap model is frequently
  used in the academic literature to simplify analysis, many practical applications
  rely on the more conservative add-remove model, where obtaining tight results can
  be difficult. Here, we study the problem of one-dimensional mean estimation under
  the add-remove model. We propose a new algorithm and show that it is min-max optimal,
  achieving the best possible constant in the leading term of the mean squared error
  for all $\epsilon$, and that this constant is the same as the optimal algorithm
  under the swap model. These results show that the add-remove and swap models give
  nearly identical errors for mean estimation, even though the add-remove model cannot
  treat the size of the dataset as public information. We also demonstrate empirically
  that our proposed algorithm yields at least a factor of two improvement in mean
  squared error over algorithms frequently used in practice. One of our main technical
  contributions is a new hourglass mechanism, which might be of independent interest
  in other scenarios.'
