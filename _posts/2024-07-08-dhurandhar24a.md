title: Trust Regions for Explanations via Black-Box Probabilistic Certification
openreview: F3RdeyiR5H
abstract: 'Given the black box nature of machine learning models, a plethora of explainability
  methods have been developed to decipher the factors behind individual decisions.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel problem of black box (probabilistic) explanation
  certification. We ask the question: Given a black box model with only query access,
  an explanation for an example and a quality metric (viz. fidelity, stability), can
  we find the largest hypercube (i.e., $\ell_{\infty}$ ball) centered at the example
  such that when the explanation is applied to all examples within the hypercube,
  (with high probability) a quality criterion is met (viz. fidelity greater than some
  value)? Being able to efficiently find such a <em>trust region</em> has multiple
  benefits: i) insight into model behavior in a <em>region</em>, with a <em>guarantee</em>;
  ii) ascertained <em>stability</em> of the explanation; iii) <em>explanation reuse</em>,
  which can save time, energy and money by not having to find explanations for every
  example; and iv) a possible <em>meta-metric</em> to compare explanation methods.
  Our contributions include formalizing this problem, proposing solutions, providing
  theoretical guarantees for these solutions that are computable, and experimentally
  showing their efficacy on synthetic and real data.'
