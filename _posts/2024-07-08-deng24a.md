title: Multi-group Learning for Hierarchical Groups
openreview: l4H7Hv7LhJ
abstract: The multi-group learning model formalizes the learning scenario in which
  a single predictor must generalize well on multiple, possibly overlapping subgroups
  of interest. We extend the study of multi-group learning to the natural case where
  the groups are hierarchically structured. We design an algorithm for this setting
  that outputs an interpretable and deterministic decision tree predictor with near-optimal
  sample complexity. We then conduct an empirical evaluation of our algorithm and
  find that it achieves attractive generalization properties on real datasets with
  hierarchical group structure.
