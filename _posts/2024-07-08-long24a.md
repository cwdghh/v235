title: Reparameterized Importance Sampling for Robust Variational Bayesian Neural
  Networks
openreview: da7MMwICjC
abstract: 'Mean-field variational inference (MFVI) methods provide computationally
  cheap approximations to the posterior of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) when compared
  to alternatives like MCMC. However, applying MFVI to BNNs encounters limitations
  due to the Monte Carlo sampling problem. This problem stems from two main issues.
  <em>First</em>, most samples do not accurately represent the most probable weights.
  <em>Second</em>, random sampling from variational distributions introduces high
  variance in gradient estimates, which can hinder the optimization process, leading
  to slow convergence or even failure. In this paper, we introduce a novel sampling
  method called <em>Reparameterized Importance Sampling</em> (RIS) to estimate the
  first moment in neural networks, reducing variance during feed-forward propagation.
  We begin by analyzing the generalized form of the optimal proposal distribution
  and presenting an inexpensive approximation. Next, we describe the sampling process
  from the proposal distribution as a transformation that combines exogenous randomness
  with the variational parameters. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
  of the proposed RIS method in three critical aspects: improved convergence, enhanced
  predictive performance, and successful uncertainty estimation for out-of-distribution
  data.'
