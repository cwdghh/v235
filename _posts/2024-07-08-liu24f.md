title: Enhancing Adversarial Robustness in SNNs with Sparse Gradients
openreview: QvABoVGdRp
abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted great attention for their
  energy-efficient operations and biologically inspired structures, offering potential
  advantages over Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in terms of energy efficiency
  and interpretability. Nonetheless, similar to ANNs, the robustness of SNNs remains
  a challenge, especially when facing adversarial attacks. Existing techniques, whether
  adapted from ANNs or specifically designed for SNNs, exhibit limitations in training
  SNNs or defending against strong attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach
  to enhance the robustness of SNNs through gradient sparsity regularization. We observe
  that SNNs exhibit greater resilience to random perturbations compared to adversarial
  perturbations, even at larger scales. Motivated by this, we aim to narrow the gap
  between SNNs under adversarial and random perturbations, thereby improving their
  overall robustness. To achieve this, we theoretically prove that this performance
  gap is upper bounded by the gradient sparsity of the probability associated with
  the true label concerning the input image, laying the groundwork for a practical
  strategy to train robust SNNs by regularizing the gradient sparsity. We validate
  the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on both image-based
  and event-based datasets. The results demonstrate notable improvements in the robustness
  of SNNs. Our work highlights the importance of gradient sparsity in SNNs and its
  role in enhancing robustness.
