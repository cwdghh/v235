title: 'MFTN: A Multi-scale Feature Transfer Network Based on IMatchFormer for Hyperspectral
  Image Super-Resolution'
openreview: JGL39NaARS
abstract: Hyperspectral image super-resolution (HISR) aims to fuse a low-resolution
  hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) with a high-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI)
  to obtain a high-resolution hyperspectral image (HR-HSI). Due to some existing HISR
  methods ignoring the significant feature difference between LR-HSI and HR-MSI, the
  reconstructed HR-HSI typically exhibits spectral distortion and blurring of spatial
  texture. To solve this issue, we propose a multi-scale feature transfer network
  (MFTN) for HISR. Firstly, three multi-scale feature extractors are constructed to
  extract features of different scales from the input images. Then, a multi-scale
  feature transfer module (MFTM) consisting of three improved feature matching Transformers
  (IMatchFormers) is designed to learn the detail features of different scales from
  HR-MSI by establishing the cross-model feature correlation between LR-HSI and degraded
  HR-MSI. Finally, a multiscale dynamic aggregation module (MDAM) containing three
  spectral aware aggregation modules (SAAMs) is constructed to reconstruct the final
  HR-HSI by gradually aggregating features of different scales. Extensive experimental
  results on three commonly used datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves
  better performance compared to state- of-the-art (SOTA) methods.
