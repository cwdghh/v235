title: 'High-Dimensional Kernel Methods under Covariate Shift: Data-Dependent Implicit
  Regularization'
openreview: bBzlapzeR1
abstract: 'This paper studies kernel ridge regression in high dimensions under covariate
  shifts and analyzes the role of importance re-weighting. We first derive the asymptotic
  expansion of high dimensional kernels under covariate shifts. By a bias-variance
  decomposition, we theoretically demonstrate that the re-weighting strategy allows
  for decreasing the variance. For bias, we analyze the regularization of the arbitrary
  or well-chosen scale, showing that the bias can behave very differently under different
  regularization scales. In our analysis, the bias and variance can be characterized
  by the spectral decay of a data-dependent regularized kernel: the original kernel
  matrix associated with an additional re-weighting matrix, and thus the re-weighting
  strategy can be regarded as a data-dependent regularization for better understanding.
  Besides, our analysis provides asymptotic expansion of kernel functions/vectors
  under covariate shift, which has its own interest.'
