title: 'IW-GAE: Importance weighted group accuracy estimation for improved calibration
  and model selection in unsupervised domain adaptation'
openreview: 5WEIVj98Ju
abstract: Distribution shifts pose significant challenges for model calibration and
  model selection tasks in the unsupervised domain adaptation problemâ€”a scenario where
  the goal is to perform well in a distribution shifted domain without labels. In
  this work, we tackle difficulties coming from distribution shifts by developing
  a novel importance weighted group accuracy estimator. Specifically, we present a
  new perspective of addressing the model calibration and model selection tasks by
  estimating the group accuracy. Then, we formulate an optimization problem for finding
  an importance weight that leads to an accurate group accuracy estimation with theoretical
  analyses. Our extensive experiments show that our approach improves state-of-the-art
  performances by 22% in the model calibration task and 14% in the model selection
  task.
