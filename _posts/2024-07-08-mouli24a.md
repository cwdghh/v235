title: Using Uncertainty Quantification to Characterize and Improve Out-of-Domain
  Learning for PDEs
openreview: Y50K6DSrWo
abstract: Existing work in scientific machine learning (SciML) has shown that data-driven
  learning of solution operators can provide a fast approximate alternative to classical
  numerical partial differential equation (PDE) solvers. Of these, Neural Operators
  (NOs) have emerged as particularly promising. We observe that several uncertainty
  quantification (UQ) methods for NOs fail for test inputs that are even moderately
  out-of-domain (OOD), even when the model approximates the solution well for in-domain
  tasks. To address this limitation, we show that ensembling several NOs can identify
  high-error regions and provide good uncertainty estimates that are well-correlated
  with prediction errors. Based on this, we propose a cost-effective alternative,
  DiverseNO, that mimics the properties of the ensemble by encouraging diverse predictions
  from its multiple heads in the last feed-forward layer. We then introduce Operator-ProbConserv,
  a method that uses these well-calibrated UQ estimates within the ProbConserv framework
  to update the model. Our empirical results show that Operator-ProbConserv enhances
  OOD model performance for a variety of challenging PDE problems and satisfies physical
  constraints such as conservation laws.
