title: 'TinyTrain: Resource-Aware Task-Adaptive Sparse Training of DNNs at the Data-Scarce
  Edge'
openreview: MWZWUyfFHC
abstract: On-device training is essential for user personalisation and privacy. With
  the pervasiveness of IoT devices and microcontroller units (MCUs), this task becomes
  more challenging due to the constrained memory and compute resources, and the limited
  availability of labelled user data. Nonetheless, prior works neglect the data scarcity
  issue, require excessively long training time ($\textit{e.g.}$ a few hours), or
  induce substantial accuracy loss ($\geq$10%). In this paper, we propose TinyTrain,
  an on-device training approach that drastically reduces training time by selectively
  updating parts of the model and explicitly coping with data scarcity. TinyTrain
  introduces a task-adaptive sparse-update method that $\textit{dynamically}$ selects
  the layer/channel to update based on a multi-objective criterion that jointly captures
  user data, the memory, and the compute capabilities of the target device, leading
  to high accuracy on unseen tasks with reduced computation and memory footprint.
  TinyTrain outperforms vanilla fine-tuning of the entire network by 3.6-5.0% in accuracy,
  while reducing the backward-pass memory and computation cost by up to 1,098$\times$
  and 7.68$\times$, respectively. Targeting broadly used real-world edge devices,
  TinyTrain achieves 9.5$\times$ faster and 3.5$\times$ more energy-efficient training
  over status-quo approaches, and 2.23$\times$ smaller memory footprint than SOTA
  methods, while remaining within the 1 MB memory envelope of MCU-grade platforms.
