title: 'MF-CLR: Multi-Frequency Contrastive Learning Representation for Time Series'
openreview: ecO7WOIlMD
abstract: Learning a decent representation from unlabeled time series is a challenging
  task, especially when the time series data is derived from diverse channels at different
  sampling rates. Our motivation stems from the financial domain, where sparsely labeled
  covariates are commonly collected at different frequencies, <em>e.g.</em>, daily
  stock market index, monthly unemployment rate and quarterly net revenue of a certain
  listed corporation. This paper presents <b>M</b>ulti-<b>F</b>requency <b>C</b>ontrastive
  <b>L</b>earning <b>R</b>epresentation (MF-CLR), aimed at learning a good representation
  of multi-frequency time series in a self-supervised paradigm by leveraging the ability
  of contrastive learning. MF-CLR introduces a hierarchical mechanism that spans across
  different frequencies along the feature dimension. Within each contrastive block,
  two groups of subseries with adjacent frequencies are embedded based on our proposed
  cross-frequency consistency. To validate the effectiveness of MF-CLR, we conduct
  extensive experiments on five downstream tasks, including long-term and short-term
  forecasting, classification, anomaly detection and imputation. Experimental evidence
  shows that MF-CLR delivers a leading performance in all the downstream tasks and
  keeps consistent performance across different target dataset scales in the transfer
  learning scenario.
