title: Non-confusing Generation of Customized Concepts in Diffusion Models
openreview: XoencoHWy7
abstract: 'We tackle the common challenge of inter-concept visual confusion in compositional
  concept generation using text-guided diffusion models (TGDMs). It becomes even more
  pronounced in the generation of customized concepts, due to the scarcity of user-provided
  concept visual examples. By revisiting the two major stages leading to the success
  of TGDMs—1) contrastive image-language pre-training (CLIP) for text encoder that
  encodes visual semantics, and 2) training TGDM that decodes the textual embeddings
  into pixels—we point that existing customized generation methods only focus on fine-tuning
  the second stage while overlooking the first one. To this end, we propose a simple
  yet effective solution called CLIF: contrastive image-language fine-tuning. Specifically,
  given a few samples of customized concepts, we obtain non-confusing textual embeddings
  of a concept by fine-tuning CLIP via contrasting a concept and the over-segmented
  visual regions of other concepts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
  of CLIF in preventing the confusion of multi-customized concept generation. Project
