title: 'MathScale: Scaling Instruction Tuning for Mathematical Reasoning'
openreview: Kjww7ZN47M
abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
  problem-solving. However, their proficiency in solving mathematical problems remains
  inadequate. We propose MathScale, a simple and scalable method to create high-quality
  mathematical reasoning data using frontier LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5). Inspired by the
  cognitive mechanism in human mathematical learning, it first extracts topics and
  knowledge points from seed math questions and then build a concept graph, which
  is subsequently used to generate new math questions. MathScale exhibits effective
  scalability along the size axis of the math dataset that we generate. As a result,
  we create a mathematical reasoning dataset (MathScaleQA) containing two million
  math question-answer pairs. To evaluate mathematical reasoning abilities of LLMs
  comprehensively, we construct MWPBench, a benchmark of Math Word Problems, which
  is a collection of 9 datasets (including GSM8K and MATH) covering K-12, college,
  and competition level math problems. We apply MathScaleQA to fine-tune open-source
  LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-2 and Mistral), resulting in significantly improved capabilities
  in mathematical reasoning. Evaluated on MWPBench, MathScale-7B achieves state-of-the-art
  performance across all datasets, surpassing its best peers of equivalent size by
  42.8% in micro average accuracy and 43.6% in macro average accuracy, respectively.
