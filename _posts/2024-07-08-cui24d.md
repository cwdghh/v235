title: Asymptotics of feature learning in two-layer networks after one gradient-step
openreview: EdRb84fiJY
abstract: In this manuscript, we investigate the problem of how two-layer neural networks
  learn features from data, and improve over the kernel regime, after being trained
  with a single gradient descent step. Leveraging the insight from (Ba et al., 2022),
  we model the trained network by a spiked Random Features (sRF) model. Further building
  on recent progress on Gaussian universality (Dandi et al., 2023), we provide an
  exact asymptotic description of the generalization error of the sRF in the high-dimensional
  limit where the number of samples, the width, and the input dimension grow at a
  proportional rate. The resulting characterization for sRFs also captures closely
  the learning curves of the original network model. This enables us to understand
  how adapting to the data is crucial for the network to efficiently learn non-linear
  functions in the direction of the gradient - where at initialization it can only
  express linear functions in this regime.
