title: 'SparseTSF: Modeling Long-term Time Series Forecasting with *1k* Parameters'
openreview: 54NSHO0lFe
abstract: 'This paper introduces SparseTSF, a novel, extremely lightweight model for
  Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF), designed to address the challenges of
  modeling complex temporal dependencies over extended horizons with minimal computational
  resources. At the heart of SparseTSF lies the Cross-Period Sparse Forecasting technique,
  which simplifies the forecasting task by decoupling the periodicity and trend in
  time series data. This technique involves downsampling the original sequences to
  focus on cross-period trend prediction, effectively extracting periodic features
  while minimizing the modelâ€™s complexity and parameter count. Based on this technique,
  the SparseTSF model uses fewer than <em>1k</em> parameters to achieve competitive
  or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, SparseTSF
  showcases remarkable generalization capabilities, making it well-suited for scenarios
  with limited computational resources, small samples, or low-quality data. The code
  is publicly available at this repository: https://github.com/lss-1138/SparseTSF.'
