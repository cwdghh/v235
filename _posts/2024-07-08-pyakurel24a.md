title: Hierarchical Novelty Detection via Fine-Grained Evidence Allocation
openreview: KfN76nAcOO
abstract: By leveraging a hierarchical structure of known classes, Hierarchical Novelty
  Detection (HND) offers fine-grained detection results that pair detected novel samples
  with their closest (known) parent class in the hierarchy. Prior knowledge on the
  parent class provides valuable insights to better understand these novel samples.
  However, traditional novelty detection methods try to separate novel samples from
  all known classes using uncertainty or distance based metrics so they are incapable
  of locating the closest known parent class. Since the novel class is also part of
  the hierarchy, the model can more easily get confused between samples from known
  classes and those from novel ones. To achieve effective HND, we propose to augment
  the known (leaf-level) classes with a set of novel classes, each of which is associated
  with one parent (i.e., non-leaf) class in the original hierarchy. Such a structure
  allows us to perform novel fine-grained evidence allocation to differentiate known
  and novel classes guided by a uniquely designed loss function. Our thorough theoretical
  analysis shows that fine-grained evidence allocation creates an evidence margin
  to more precisely separate known and novel classes. Extensive experiments conducted
  on real-world hierarchical datasets demonstrate the proposed model outperforms the
  strongest baselines and achieves the best HND performance.
