title: Learning Causal Relations from Subsampled Time Series with Two Time-Slices
openreview: 60F0fVbknK
abstract: This paper studies the causal relations from subsampled time series, in
  which measurements are sparse and sampled at a coarser timescale than the causal
  timescale of the underlying system. In such data, because there are numerous missing
  time-slices (i.e., cross-sections at each time point) between two consecutive measurements,
  conventional causal discovery methods designed for standard time series data would
  produce significant errors. To learn causal relations from subsampled time series,
  a typical solution is to conduct different interventions and then make a comparison.
  However, full interventions are often expensive, unethical, or even infeasible,
  particularly in fields such as health and social science. In this paper, we first
  explore how readily available two-time-slices data can replace intervention data
  to improve causal ordering, and propose a novel Descendant Hierarchical Topology
  algorithm with Conditional Independence Test (DHT-CIT) to learn causal relations
  from subsampled time series using only two time-slices. Specifically, we develop
  a conditional independence criterion that can be applied iteratively to test each
  node from time series and identify all of its descendant nodes. Empirical results
  on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our DHT-CIT
  algorithm.
