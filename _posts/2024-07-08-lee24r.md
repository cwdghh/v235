title: Why Do Animals Need Shaping? A Theory of Task Composition and Curriculum Learning
openreview: S0DPCE7tt4
abstract: Diverse studies in systems neuroscience begin with extended periods of curriculum
  training known as ‘shaping’ procedures. These involve progressively studying component
  parts of more complex tasks, and can make the difference between learning a task
  quickly, slowly or not at all. Despite the importance of shaping to the acquisition
  of complex tasks, there is as yet no theory that can help guide the design of shaping
  procedures, or more fundamentally, provide insight into its key role in learning.
  Modern deep reinforcement learning systems might implicitly learn compositional
  primitives within their multilayer policy networks. Inspired by these models, we
  propose and analyse a model of deep policy gradient learning of simple compositional
  reinforcement learning tasks. Using the tools of statistical physics, we solve for
  exact learning dynamics and characterise different learning strategies including
  primitives pre-training, in which task primitives are studied individually before
  learning compositional tasks. We find a complex interplay between task complexity
  and the efficacy of shaping strategies. Overall, our theory provides an analytical
  understanding of the benefits of shaping in a class of compositional tasks and a
  quantitative account of how training protocols can disclose useful task primitives,
  ultimately yielding faster and more robust learning.
