title: PAC-Bayesian Error Bound, via Rényi Divergence, for a Class of Linear Time-Invariant
  State-Space Models
openreview: a1Olc2QhPv
abstract: In this paper we derive a PAC-Bayesian error bound for a class of stochastic
  dynamical systems with inputs, namely, for linear time-invariant stochastic state-space
  models (stochastic LTI systems for short). This class of systems is widely used
  in control engineering and econometrics, in particular, they represent a special
  case of recurrent neural networks. In this paper we 1) formalize the learning problem
  for stochastic LTI systems with inputs, 2) derive a PAC-Bayesian error bound for
  such systems, and 3) discuss various consequences of this error bound.
