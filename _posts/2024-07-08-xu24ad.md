title: Language Agents with Reinforcement Learning for Strategic Play in the Werewolf
  Game
openreview: usUPvQH3XK
abstract: Agents built with large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential
  across a wide range of domains. However, in complex decision-making tasks, pure
  LLM-based agents tend to exhibit intrinsic bias in their choice of actions, which
  is inherited from the modelâ€™s training data and results in suboptimal performance.
  To develop <em>strategic language agents</em>, i.e., agents that generate flexible
  language actions and possess strong decision-making abilities, we propose a novel
  framework that powers LLM-based agents with reinforcement learning (RL). We consider
  Werewolf, a popular social deduction game, as a challenging testbed that emphasizes
  versatile communication and strategic gameplay. To mitigate the intrinsic bias in
  language actions, our agents use an LLM to perform deductive reasoning and generate
  a diverse set of action candidates. Then an RL policy trained to optimize the decision-making
  ability chooses an action from the candidates to play in the game. Extensive experiments
  show that our agents overcome the intrinsic bias and outperform existing LLM-based
  agents in the Werewolf game. We also conduct human-agent experiments and find that
  our agents achieve human-level performance and demonstrate strong strategic play.
