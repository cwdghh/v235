title: Stability-Informed Initialization of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations
openreview: uiqbnV4msl
abstract: This paper addresses the training of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations
  (neural ODEs), and in particular explores the interplay between numerical integration
  techniques, stability regions, step size, and initialization techniques. It is shown
  how the choice of integration technique implicitly regularizes the learned model,
  and how the solverâ€™s corresponding stability region affects training and prediction
  performance. From this analysis, a stability-informed parameter initialization technique
  is introduced. The effectiveness of the initialization method is displayed across
  several learning benchmarks and industrial applications.
