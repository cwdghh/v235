title: Visual Representation Learning with Stochastic Frame Prediction
openreview: rI6lxIX0uX
abstract: 'Self-supervised learning of image representations by predicting future
  frames is a promising direction but still remains a challenge. This is because of
  the under-determined nature of frame prediction; multiple potential futures can
  arise from a single current frame. To tackle this challenge, in this paper, we revisit
  the idea of stochastic video generation that learns to capture uncertainty in frame
  prediction and explore its effectiveness for representation learning. Specifically,
  we design a framework that trains a stochastic frame prediction model to learn temporal
  information between frames. Moreover, to learn dense information within each frame,
  we introduce an auxiliary masked image modeling objective along with a shared decoder
  architecture. We find this architecture allows for combining both objectives in
  a synergistic and compute-efficient manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
  our framework on a variety of tasks from video label propagation and vision-based
  robot learning domains, such as video segmentation, pose tracking, vision-based
  robotic locomotion, and manipulation tasks. Code is available on the project webpage:
