title: Learning Scale-Aware Spatio-temporal Implicit Representation for Event-based
  Motion Deblurring
openreview: udFZhUgtkI
abstract: Existing event-based motion deblurring methods mostly focus on restoring
  images with the same spatial and temporal scales as events. However, the unknown
  scales of images and events in the real world pose great challenges and have rarely
  been explored. To address this gap, we propose a novel Scale-Aware Spatio-temporal
  Network (SASNet) to flexibly restore blurred images with event streams at arbitrary
  scales. The core idea is to implicitly aggregate both spatial and temporal correspondence
  features of images and events to generalize at continuous scales. To restore highly
  blurred local areas, we develop a Spatial Implicit Representation Module (SIRM)
  to aggregate spatial correlation at any resolution through event encoding sampling.
  To tackle global motion blur, a Temporal Implicit Representation Module (TIRM) is
  presented to learn temporal correlation via temporal shift operations with long-term
  aggregation. Additionally, we build a High-resolution Hybrid Deblur (H2D) dataset
  using a new-generation hybrid event-based sensor, which comprises images with naturally
  spatially aligned and temporally synchronized events at various scales. Experiments
  demonstrate that our SASNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic
  GoPro and real H2D datasets, especially in high-speed motion scenarios. Code and
  dataset are available at https://github.com/aipixel/SASNet.
