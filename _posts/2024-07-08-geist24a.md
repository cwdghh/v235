title: Learning with 3D rotations, a hitchhiker’s guide to SO(3)
openreview: L0VoOdjCUb
abstract: Many settings in machine learning require the selection of a rotation representation.
  However, choosing a suitable representation from the many available options is challenging.
  This paper acts as a survey and guide through rotation representations. We walk
  through their properties that harm or benefit deep learning with gradient-based
  optimization. By consolidating insights from rotation-based learning, we provide
  a comprehensive overview of learning functions with rotation representations. We
  provide guidance on selecting representations based on whether rotations are in
  the model’s input or output and whether the data primarily comprises small angles.
