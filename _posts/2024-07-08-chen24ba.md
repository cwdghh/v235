title: 'FedMBridge: Bridgeable Multimodal Federated Learning'
openreview: jrHUbftLd6
abstract: Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) addresses the setup of multiple clients
  with diversified modality types (e.g. image, text, video, and audio) working together
  to improve their local personal models in a data-privacy manner. Prior MFL works
  rely on restrictive compositional neural architecture designs to ensure inter-client
  information sharing via blockwise model aggregation, limiting their applicability
  in the real-world <b>Architecture-personalized MFL (AMFL)</b> scenarios, where clients
  may have distinguished multimodal interaction strategies and there is no restriction
  on local architecture design. The key challenge in AMFL is how to automatically
  and efficiently tackle the two heterogeneity patterns–statistical and architecture
  heterogeneity–while maximizing the beneficial information sharing among clients.
  To solve this challenge, we propose <b>FedMBridge</b>, which leverages a topology-aware
  hypernetwork to act as a bridge that can automatically balance and digest the two
  heterogeneity patterns in a communication-efficient manner. Our experiments on four
  AMFL simulations demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed approach.
