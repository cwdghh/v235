title: Graph Neural PDE Solvers with Conservation and Similarity-Equivariance
openreview: WajJf47TUi
abstract: Utilizing machine learning to address partial differential equations (PDEs)
  presents significant challenges due to the diversity of spatial domains and their
  corresponding state configurations, which complicates the task of encompassing all
  potential scenarios through data-driven methodologies alone. Moreover, there are
  legitimate concerns regarding the generalization and reliability of such approaches,
  as they often overlook inherent physical constraints. In response to these challenges,
  this study introduces a novel machine-learning architecture that is highly generalizable
  and adheres to conservation laws and physical symmetries, thereby ensuring greater
  reliability. The foundation of this architecture is graph neural networks (GNNs),
  which are adept at accommodating a variety of shapes and forms. Additionally, we
  explore the parallels between GNNs and traditional numerical solvers, facilitating
  a seamless integration of conservative principles and symmetries into machine learning
  models. Our findings from experiments demonstrate that the modelâ€™s inclusion of
  physical laws significantly enhances its generalizability, i.e., no significant
  accuracy degradation for unseen spatial domains while other models degrade. The
