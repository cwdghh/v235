title: Selective Mixup Helps with Distribution Shifts, But Not (Only) because of Mixup
openreview: ksph9pkEDc
abstract: Mixup is a highly successful technique to improve generalization by augmenting
  training data with combinations of random pairs. Selective mixup is a family of
  methods that apply mixup to specific pairs e.g. combining examples across classes
  or domains. Despite remarkable performance on benchmarks with distribution shifts,
  these methods are still poorly understood. We find that an overlooked aspect of
  selective mixup explains some of its success in a completely new light. The non-random
  selection of pairs affects the training distribution and improves generalization
  by means completely unrelated to the mixing. For example in binary classification,
  mixup across classes implicitly resamples the data to uniform class distribution
  - a classical solution to label shift. We verify empirically that this resampling
  explains some of the improvements reported in prior work. Theoretically, the effect
  relies on a “regression toward the mean”, an accidental property we find in several
  datasets. Outcomes. We now better understand why selective mixup works. This lets
  us predict a yet-unknown failure mode and conditions where the method is detrimental.
  We also use the equivalence with resampling to design better variants that combine
  mixing and resampling effects.
