title: 'A3S: A General Active Clustering Method with Pairwise Constraints'
openreview: c18noxRh3X
abstract: Active clustering aims to boost the clustering performance by integrating
  human-annotated pairwise constraints through strategic querying. Conventional approaches
  with semi-supervised clustering schemes encounter high query costs when applied
  to large datasets with numerous classes. To address these limitations, we propose
  a novel Adaptive Active Aggregation and Splitting (A3S) framework, falling within
  the cluster-adjustment scheme in active clustering. A3S features strategic active
  clustering adjustment on the initial cluster result, which is obtained by an adaptive
  clustering algorithm. In particular, our cluster adjustment is inspired by the quantitative
  analysis of Normalized mutual information gain under the information theory framework
  and can provably improve the clustering quality. The proposed A3S framework significantly
  elevates the performance and scalability of active clustering. In extensive experiments
  across diverse real-world datasets, A3S achieves desired results with significantly
  fewer human queries compared with existing methods.
