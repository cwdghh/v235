title: No-Regret Reinforcement Learning in Smooth MDPs
openreview: GGnYDXZC1B
abstract: Obtaining no-regret guarantees for reinforcement learning (RL) in the case
  of problems with continuous state and/or action spaces is still one of the major
  open challenges in the field. Recently, a variety of solutions have been proposed,
  but besides very specific settings, the general problem remains unsolved. In this
  paper, we introduce a novel structural assumption on the Markov decision processes
  (MDPs), namely $\nu-$smoothness, that generalizes most of the settings proposed
  so far (e.g., linear MDPs and Lipschitz MDPs). To face this challenging scenario,
  we propose two algorithms for regret minimization in $\nu-$smooth MDPs. Both algorithms
  build upon the idea of constructing an MDP representation through an orthogonal
  feature map based on Legendre polynomials. The first algorithm, Legendre-Eleanor,
  archives the no-regret property under weaker assumptions but is computationally
  inefficient, whereas the second one, Legendre-LSVI, runs in polynomial time, although
  for a smaller class of problems. After analyzing their regret properties, we compare
  our results with state-of-the-art ones from RL theory, showing that our algorithms
  achieve the best guarantees.
