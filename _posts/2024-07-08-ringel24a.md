title: Early Time Classification with Accumulated Accuracy Gap Control
openreview: 0b7txvPYlr
abstract: Early time classification algorithms aim to label a stream of features without
  processing the full input stream, while maintaining accuracy comparable to that
  achieved by applying the classifier to the entire input. In this paper, we introduce
  a statistical framework that can be applied to any sequential classifier, formulating
  a calibrated stopping rule. This data-driven rule attains finite-sample, distribution-free
  control of the accuracy gap between full and early-time classification. We start
  by presenting a novel method that builds on the Learn-then-Test calibration framework
  to control this gap marginally, on average over i.i.d. instances. As this algorithm
  tends to yield an excessively high accuracy gap for early halt times, our main contribution
  is the proposal of a framework that controls a stronger notion of error, where the
  accuracy gap is controlled conditionally on the accumulated halt times. Numerical
  experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, applicability, and usefulness of our
  method. We show that our proposed early stopping mechanism reduces up to 94% of
  timesteps used for classification while achieving rigorous accuracy gap control.
