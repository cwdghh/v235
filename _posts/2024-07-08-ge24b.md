title: Safe and Robust Subgame Exploitation in Imperfect Information Games
openreview: JV84NVo1em
abstract: Opponent exploitation is an important task for players to exploit the weaknesses
  of others in games. Existing approaches mainly focus on balancing between exploitation
  and exploitability but are often vulnerable to modeling errors and deceptive adversaries.
  To address this problem, our paper offers a novel perspective on the safety of opponent
  exploitation, named Adaptation Safety. This concept leverages the insight that strategies,
  even those not explicitly aimed at opponent exploitation, may inherently be exploitable
  due to computational complexities, rendering traditional safety overly rigorous.
  In contrast, adaptation safety requires that the strategy should not be more exploitable
  than it would be in scenarios where opponent exploitation is not considered. Building
  on such adaptation safety, we further propose an Opponent eXploitation Search (OX-Search)
  framework by incorporating real-time search techniques for efficient online opponent
  exploitation. Moreover, we provide theoretical analyses to show the adaptation safety
  and robust exploitation of OX-Search, even with inaccurate opponent models. Empirical
  evaluations in popular poker games demonstrate OX-Searchâ€™s superiority in both exploitability
  and exploitation compared to previous methods.
