title: Improved Communication-Privacy Trade-offs in $L_2$ Mean Estimation under Streaming
  Differential Privacy
openreview: x1G7ieRgRd
abstract: 'We study $L_2$ mean estimation under central differential privacy and communication
  constraints, and address two key challenges: firstly, existing mean estimation schemes
  that simultaneously handle both constraints are usually optimized for $L_\infty$
  geometry and rely on random rotation or Kashinâ€™s representation to adapt to $L_2$
  geometry, resulting in suboptimal leading constants in mean square errors (MSEs);
  secondly, schemes achieving order-optimal communication-privacy trade-offs do not
  extend seamlessly to streaming differential privacy (DP) settings (e.g., tree aggregation
  or matrix factorization), rendering them incompatible with DP-FTRL type optimizers.
  In this work, we tackle these issues by introducing a novel privacy accounting method
  for the sparsified Gaussian mechanism that incorporates the randomness inherent
  in sparsification into the DP noise. Unlike previous approaches, our accounting
  algorithm directly operates in $L_2$ geometry, yielding MSEs that fast converge
  to those of the uncompressed Gaussian mechanism. Additionally, we extend the sparsification
  scheme to the matrix factorization framework under streaming DP and provide a precise
  accountant tailored for DP-FTRL type optimizers. Empirically, our method demonstrates
  at least a 100x improvement of compression for DP-SGD across various FL tasks.'
