title: Probabilistic Inference in Language Models via Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo
openreview: frA0NNBS1n
abstract: Numerous capability and safety techniques of Large Language Models (LLMs),
  including RLHF, automated red-teaming, prompt engineering, and infilling, can be
  cast as sampling from an unnormalized target distribution defined by a given reward
  or potential function over the full sequence. In this work, we leverage the rich
  toolkit of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) for these probabilistic inference problems.
  In particular, we use learned twist functions to estimate the expected future value
  of the potential at each timestep, which enables us to focus inference-time computation
  on promising partial sequences. We propose a novel contrastive method for learning
  the twist functions, and establish connections with the rich literature of soft
  reinforcement learning. As a complementary application of our twisted SMC framework,
  we present methods for evaluating the accuracy of language model inference techniques
  using novel bidirectional SMC bounds on the log partition function. These bounds
  can be used to estimate the KL divergence between the inference and target distributions
  in both directions. We apply our inference evaluation techniques to show that twisted
  SMC is effective for sampling undesirable outputs from a pretrained model (a useful
  component of harmlessness training and automated red-teaming), generating reviews
  with varied sentiment, and performing infilling tasks.
