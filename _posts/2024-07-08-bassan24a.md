title: 'Local vs. Global Interpretability: A Computational Complexity Perspective'
openreview: veEjiN2w9F
abstract: 'The local and global interpretability of various ML models has been studied
  extensively in recent years. However, despite significant progress in the field,
  many known results remain informal or lack sufficient mathematical rigor. We propose
  a framework for bridging this gap, by using computational complexity theory to assess
  local and global perspectives of interpreting ML models. We begin by proposing proofs
  for two novel insights that are essential for our analysis: (1) a duality between
  local and global forms of explanations; and (2) the inherent uniqueness of certain
  global explanation forms. We then use these insights to evaluate the complexity
  of computing explanations, across three model types representing the extremes of
  the interpretability spectrum: (1) linear models; (2) decision trees; and (3) neural
  networks. Our findings offer insights into both the local and global interpretability
  of these models. For instance, under standard complexity assumptions such as P !=
  NP, we prove that selecting <em>global</em> sufficient subsets in linear models
  is computationally harder than selecting <em>local</em> subsets. Interestingly,
  with neural networks and decision trees, the opposite is true: it is harder to carry
  out this task locally than globally. We believe that our findings demonstrate how
  examining explainability through a computational complexity lens can help us develop
  a more rigorous grasp of the inherent interpretability of ML models.'
