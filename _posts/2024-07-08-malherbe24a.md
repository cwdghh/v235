title: Measures of diversity and space-filling designs for categorical data
openreview: YoUb2vW9WP
abstract: Selecting a small subset of items that represent the diversity of a larger
  population lies at the heart of many data analysis and machine learning applications.
  However, when it comes to items described by discrete features, the lack of natural
  ordering and the combinatorial nature of the search space pose significant challenges
  to the current selection techniques and make existing methods ill-suited. In this
  paper, we propose to make a step in that direction by proposing novel methods to
  select subsets of diverse categorical data based on the advances in combinatorial
  optimization. First, we start to cast the subset selection problem through the lens
  of the optimization of three diversity metrics. We then provide novel bounds for
  this problem and present exact solvers that unfortunately come with a high computational
  cost. To overcome this bottleneck, we go on and show how to employ tools from linear
  programming and submodular optimization by introducing two computationally plausible
  methods that still present approximation guarantees about the diversity metrics.
  Finally, a numerical assessment is provided to illustrate the potential of the designs
  with respect to state-of-the-art methods.
