title: Efficient Value Iteration for s-rectangular Robust Markov Decision Processes
openreview: J4LTDgwAZq
abstract: We focus on s-rectangular robust Markov decision processes (MDPs), which
  capture interconnected uncertainties across different actions within each state.
  This framework is more general compared to sa-rectangular robust MDPs, where uncertainties
  in each action are independent. However, the introduced interdependence significantly
  amplifies the complexity of the problem. Existing methods either have slow performance
  guarantees or are inapplicable to even moderately large state spaces. In this work,
  we derive optimal robust Bellman operators in explicit forms. This leads to robust
  value iteration methods with significantly faster time complexities than existing
  approaches, which can be used in large state spaces. Further, our findings reveal
  that the optimal policies demonstrate a novel threshold behavior, selectively favoring
  a limited set of actions based on their respective advantage functions. Additionally,
  our study uncovers a noteworthy connection between the robustness of a policy and
  the variance in its value function, highlighting that policies with lower variance
  exhibit greater resilience.
