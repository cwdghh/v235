title: Differentially Private Representation Learning via Image Captioning
openreview: Nw7yOe8nBi
abstract: Differentially private (DP) machine learning is considered the gold-standard
  solution for training a model from sensitive data while still preserving privacy.
  However, a major barrier to achieving this ideal is its sub-optimal privacy-accuracy
  trade-off, which is particularly visible in DP representation learning. Specifically,
  it has been shown that under modest privacy budgets, most models learn representations
  that are not significantly better than hand-crafted features. In this work, we show
  that effective DP representation learning can be done via image captioning and scaling
  up to internet-scale multimodal datasets. Through a series of engineering tricks,
  we successfully train a DP image captioner (DP-Cap) on a 233M subset of LAION-2B
  from scratch using a reasonable amount of computation, and obtaining unprecedented
  high-quality image features that can be used in a variety of downstream vision and
  vision-language tasks. For example, under a privacy budget of $\varepsilon=8$ for
  the LAION dataset, a linear classifier trained on top of learned DP-Cap features
  attains $65.8%$ accuracy on ImageNet-1K, considerably improving the previous SOTA
  of $56.5%$. Our work challenges the prevailing sentiment that high-utility DP representation
  learning cannot be achieved by training from scratch.
