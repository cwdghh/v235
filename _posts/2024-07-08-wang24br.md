title: Benchmarking Deletion Metrics with the Principled Explanations
openreview: SKPhvzxO1g
abstract: 'Insertion/deletion metrics and their variants have been extensively applied
  to evaluate attribution-based explanation methods. Such metrics measure the significance
  of features by observing changes in model predictions as features are incrementally
  inserted or deleted. Given the direct connection between the attribution values
  and model predictions that insertion/deletion metrics enable, they are commonly
  used as the decisive metrics for novel attribution methods. Such influential metrics
  for explanation methods should be handled with great scrutiny. However, contemporary
  research on insertion/deletion metrics falls short of a comprehensive analysis.
  To address this, we propose the TRAjectory importanCE (TRACE) framework, which achieves
  the best scores of the insertion/deletion metric. Our contribution includes two
  aspects: 1) TRACE stands as the principled explanation for explaining the influence
  of feature deletion on model predictions. We demonstrate that TRACE is guaranteed
  to achieve almost optimal results both theoretically and empirically. 2) Using TRACE,
  we benchmark insertion/deletion metrics across all possible settings and study critical
  problems such as the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue, and provide practical guidance
  on applying these metrics in practice.'
