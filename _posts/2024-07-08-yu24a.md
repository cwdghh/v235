title: Efficient Algorithms for Empirical Group Distributionally Robust Optimization
  and Beyond
openreview: pOJbk4Nzmi
abstract: In this paper, we investigate the empirical counterpart of Group Distributionally
  Robust Optimization (GDRO), which aims to minimize the maximal empirical risk across
  $m$ distinct groups. We formulate empirical GDRO as a <em>two-level</em> finite-sum
  convex-concave minimax optimization problem and develop an algorithm called ALEG
  to benefit from its special structure. ALEG is a double-looped stochastic primal-dual
  algorithm that incorporates variance reduction techniques into a modified mirror
  prox routine. To exploit the two-level finite-sum structure, we propose a simple
  group sampling strategy to construct the stochastic gradient with a smaller Lipschitz
  constant and then perform variance reduction for all groups. Theoretical analysis
  shows that ALEG achieves $\varepsilon$-accuracy within a computation complexity
  of $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{m\sqrt{\bar{n}\ln{m}}}{\varepsilon}\right)$, where $\bar
  n$ is the average number of samples among $m$ groups. Notably, our approach outperforms
  the state-of-the-art method by a factor of $\sqrt{m}$. Based on ALEG, we further
  develop a two-stage optimization algorithm called ALEM to deal with the empirical
  Minimax Excess Risk Optimization (MERO) problem. The computation complexity of ALEM
  nearly matches that of ALEG, surpassing the rates of existing methods.
