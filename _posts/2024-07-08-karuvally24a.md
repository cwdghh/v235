title: Hidden Traveling Waves bind Working Memory Variables in Recurrent Neural Networks
openreview: NCjlFw1Ab0
abstract: 'Traveling waves are a fundamental phenomenon in the brain, playing a crucial
  role in short-term information storage. In this study, we leverage the concept of
  traveling wave dynamics within a neural lattice to formulate a theoretical model
  of neural working memory in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), study its properties,
  and its real world implications in AI. The proposed model diverges from traditional
  approaches, which assume information storage in static, register-like locations
  updated by interference. Instead, the model stores data as waves that is updated
  by the wave’s boundary conditions. We rigorously examine the model’s capabilities
  in representing and learning state histories, which are vital for learning history-dependent
  dynamical systems. The findings reveal that the model reliably stores external information
  and enhances the learning process by addressing the diminishing gradient problem
  of RNNs. To understand the model’s real-world applicability, we explore two cases:
  linear boundary condition and non-linear, self-attention-driven boundary condition.
  The experiments reveal that the linear scenario is effectively <em>learned</em>
  by RNNs through backpropagation when modeling history-dependent dynamical systems.
  Conversely, the non-linear scenario parallels an attention-only transformer. Collectively,
  our findings suggest the broader relevance of traveling waves in AI and its potential
  in advancing neural network architectures.'
