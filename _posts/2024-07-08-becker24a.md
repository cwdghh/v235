title: Standardized Interpretable Fairness Measures for Continuous Risk Scores
openreview: CvRu2inbGV
abstract: We propose a standardized version of fairness measures for continuous scores
  with a reasonable interpretation based on the Wasserstein distance. Our measures
  are easily computable and well suited for quantifying and interpreting the strength
  of group disparities as well as for comparing biases across different models, datasets,
  or time points. We derive a link between the different families of existing fairness
  measures for scores and show that the proposed standardized fairness measures outperform
  ROC-based fairness measures because they are more explicit and can quantify significant
  biases that ROC-based fairness measures miss.
