title: 'VoroNav: Voronoi-based Zero-shot Object Navigation with Large Language Model'
openreview: Va7mhTVy5s
abstract: 'In the realm of household robotics, the Zero-Shot Object Navigation (ZSON)
  task empowers agents to adeptly traverse unfamiliar environments and locate objects
  from novel categories without prior explicit training. This paper introduces VoroNav,
  a novel semantic exploration framework that proposes the Reduced Voronoi Graph to
  extract exploratory paths and planning nodes from a semantic map constructed in
  real time. By harnessing topological and semantic information, VoroNav designs text-based
  descriptions of paths and images that are readily interpretable by a large language
  model (LLM). In particular, our approach presents a synergy of path and farsight
  descriptions to represent the environmental context, enabling LLM to apply commonsense
  reasoning to ascertain waypoints for navigation. Extensive evaluation on HM3D and
  HSSD validates VoroNav surpasses existing benchmarks in both success rate and exploration
  efficiency (absolute improvement: +2.8% Success and +3.7% SPL on HM3D, +2.6% Success
  and +3.8% SPL on HSSD). Additionally introduced metrics that evaluate obstacle avoidance
  proficiency and perceptual efficiency further corroborate the enhancements achieved
  by our method in ZSON planning. Project page: https://voro-nav.github.io'
