title: Graph External Attention Enhanced Transformer
openreview: 0rV7VIrcjX
abstract: 'The Transformer architecture has recently gained considerable attention
  in the field of graph representation learning, as it naturally overcomes several
  limitations of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with customized attention mechanisms
  or positional and structural encodings. Despite making some progress, existing works
  tend to overlook external information of graphs, specifically the correlation between
  graphs. Intuitively, graphs with similar structures should have similar representations.
  Therefore, we propose Graph External Attention (GEA) â€” a novel attention mechanism
  that leverages multiple external node/edge key-value units to capture inter-graph
  correlations implicitly. On this basis, we design an effective architecture called
  Graph External Attention Enhanced Transformer (GEAET), which integrates local structure
  and global interaction information for more comprehensive graph representations.
  Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GEAET achieves state-of-the-art
  empirical performance. The source code is available for reproducibility at: https://github.com/icm1018/GEAET.'
