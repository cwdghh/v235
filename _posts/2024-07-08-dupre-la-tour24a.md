title: 'Making Old Things New: A Unified Algorithm for Differentially Private Clustering'
openreview: 3ajK5xplDL
abstract: 'As a staple of data analysis and unsupervised learning, the problem of
  private clustering has been widely studied, under various privacy models. Centralized
  differential privacy is the first of them, and the problem has also been studied
  for the local and the shuffle variation. In each case, the goal is to design an
  algorithm that computes privately a clustering, with the smallest possible error.
  The study of each variation gave rise to new algorithm: the landscape of private
  clustering algorithm is therefore quite intricate. In this paper, we show that a
  20 year-old algorithm can be slightly modified to work for any of those models.
  This provides a unified picture: while matching almost all previously known results,
  it allows us to improve some of them, and extend to a new privacy model, the continual
  observation setting, where the input is changing over time and the algorithm must
  output a new solution at each time step.'
