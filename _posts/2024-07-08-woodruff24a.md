title: Coresets for Multiple $\ell_p$ Regression
openreview: 4UWjqrMmFp
abstract: A <em>coreset</em> of a dataset with $n$ examples and $d$ features is a
  weighted subset of examples that is sufficient for solving downstream data analytic
  tasks. Nearly optimal constructions of coresets for least squares and $\ell_p$ linear
  regression with a single response are known in prior work. However, for multiple
  $\ell_p$ regression where there can be $m$ responses, there are no known constructions
  with size sublinear in $m$. In this work, we construct coresets of size $\tilde
  O(\varepsilon^{-2}d)$ for $p<2$ and $\tilde O(\varepsilon^{-p}d^{p/2})$ for $p>2$
  independently of $m$ (i.e., dimension-free) that approximate the multiple $\ell_p$
  regression objective at every point in the domain up to $(1\pm\varepsilon)$ relative
  error. If we only need to preserve the minimizer subject to a subspace constraint,
  we improve these bounds by an $\varepsilon$ factor for all $p>1$. All of our bounds
  are nearly tight. We give two application of our results. First, we settle the number
  of uniform samples needed to approximate $\ell_p$ Euclidean power means up to a
  $(1+\varepsilon)$ factor, showing that $\tilde\Theta(\varepsilon^{-2})$ samples
  for $p = 1$, $\tilde\Theta(\varepsilon^{-1})$ samples for $1 < p < 2$, and $\tilde\Theta(\varepsilon^{1-p})$
  samples for $p>2$ is tight, answering a question of Cohen-Addad, Saulpic, and Schwiegelshohn.
  Second, we show that for $1<p<2$, every matrix has a subset of $\tilde O(\varepsilon^{-1}k)$
  rows which spans a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximately optimal $k$-dimensional subspace
  for $\ell_p$ subspace approximation, which is also nearly optimal.
