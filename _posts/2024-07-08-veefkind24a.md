title: A Probabilistic Approach to Learning the Degree of Equivariance in Steerable
  CNNs
openreview: 49vHLSxjzy
abstract: Steerable convolutional neural networks (SCNNs) enhance task performance
  by modelling geometric symmetries through equivariance constraints on weights. Yet,
  unknown or varying symmetries can lead to overconstrained weights and decreased
  performance. To address this, this paper introduces a probabilistic method to learn
  the degree of equivariance in SCNNs. We parameterise the degree of equivariance
  as a likelihood distribution over the transformation group using Fourier coefficients,
  offering the option to model layer-wise and shared equivariance. These likelihood
  distributions are regularised to ensure an interpretable degree of equivariance
  across the network. Advantages include the applicability to many types of equivariant
  networks through the flexible framework of SCNNs and the ability to learn equivariance
  with respect to any subgroup of any compact group without requiring additional layers.
  Our experiments reveal competitive performance on datasets with mixed symmetries,
  with learnt likelihood distributions that are representative of the underlying degree
  of equivariance.
