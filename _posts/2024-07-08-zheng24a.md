title: How Does Goal Relabeling Improve Sample Efficiency?
openreview: 99UFZV2VpU
abstract: Hindsight experience replay and goal relabeling are successful in reinforcement
  learning (RL) since they enable agents to learn from failures. Despite their successes,
  we lack a theoretical understanding, such as (i) why hindsight experience replay
  improves sample efficiency and (ii) how to design a relabeling method that achieves
  sample efficiency. To this end, we construct an example to show the information-theoretical
  improvement in sample efficiency achieved by goal relabeling. Our example reveals
  that goal relabeling can enhance sample efficiency and exploit the rich information
  in observations through better hypothesis elimination. Based on these insights,
  we develop an RL algorithm called GOALIVE. To analyze the sample complexity of GOALIVE,
  we introduce a complexity measure, the goal-conditioned Bellman-Eluder (GOAL-BE)
  dimension, which characterizes the sample complexity of goal-conditioned RL problems.
  Compared to the Bellman-Eluder dimension, the goal-conditioned version offers an
  exponential improvement in the best case. To the best of our knowledge, our work
  provides the first characterization of the theoretical improvement in sample efficiency
  achieved by goal relabeling.
