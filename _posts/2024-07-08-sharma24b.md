title: 'Diffuse, Sample, Project: Plug-And-Play Controllable Graph Generation'
openreview: ia0Z8d1DbY
abstract: 'Diffusion models lend transformative capabilities to the graph generation
  task, yet controlling the properties of the generated graphs remains challenging.
  Recent approaches augment support for controlling soft, differentiable properties
  but they fail to handle user-specified hard constraints that are non-differentiable.
  This often results in vague control, unsuitable for applications like drug discovery
  that demand satisfaction of precise constraints, e.g., the maximum number of bonds.
  To address this, we formalize the problem of controlled graph generation and introduce
  PRODIGY (PROjected DIffusion for controlled Graph Generation), an innovative plug-and-play
  approach enabling the generation of graphs with precise control, from any pre-trained
  diffusion model. PRODIGY employs a novel operator to project the samples at each
  diffusion step onto the specified constrained space. For a large class of practical
  constraints and a variety of graphs, our extensive experiments demonstrate that
  PRODIGY empowers state-of-the-art continuous and discrete diffusion models to produce
  graphs meeting specific, hard constraints. Our approach achieves up to 100% constraint
  satisfaction for non-attributed and molecular graphs, under a variety of constraints,
  marking a significant step forward in precise, interpretable graph generation. Code
