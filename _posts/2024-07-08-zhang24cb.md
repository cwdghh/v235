title: 'MLIP: Efficient Multi-Perspective Language-Image Pretraining with Exhaustive
  Data Utilization'
openreview: q6fXuPLpao
abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has achieved remarkable success,
  leading to rapid advancements in multimodal studies. However, CLIP faces a notable
  challenge in terms of <em>inefficient data utilization</em>. It relies on a single
  contrastive supervision for each image-text pair during representation learning,
  disregarding a substantial amount of valuable information that could offer richer
  supervision. Additionally, the retention of non-informative tokens leads to increased
  computational demands and time costs, particularly in CLIP’s ViT image encoder.
  To address these issues, we propose <b>M</b>ulti-Perspective <b>L</b>anguage-<b>I</b>mage
  <b>P</b>retraining (<b>MLIP</b>). In MLIP, we leverage the frequency transform’s
  sensitivity to both high and low-frequency variations, which complements the spatial
  domain’s sensitivity limited to low-frequency variations only. By incorporating
  frequency transforms and token-level alignment, we expand CILP’s single supervision
  into multi-domain and multi-level supervision, enabling a more thorough exploration
  of informative image features. Additionally, we introduce a token merging method
  guided by comprehensive semantics from the frequency and spatial domains. This allows
  us to merge tokens to multi-granularity tokens with a controllable compression rate
  to accelerate CLIP. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our design.
