title: 'Universality of Linear Recurrences Followed by Non-linear Projections: Finite-Width
  Guarantees and Benefits of Complex Eigenvalues'
openreview: 47ahBl70xb
abstract: 'Deep neural networks based on linear RNNs interleaved with position-wise
  MLPs are gaining traction as competitive approaches for sequence modeling. Examples
  of such architectures include state-space models (SSMs) like S4, LRU, and Mamba:
  recently proposed models that achieve promising performance on text, genetics, and
  other data that require long-range reasoning. Despite experimental evidence highlighting
  these architecturesâ€™ effectiveness and computational efficiency, their expressive
  power remains relatively unexplored, especially in connection to specific choices
  crucial in practice - e.g., carefully designed initialization distribution and potential
  use of complex numbers. In this paper, we show that combining MLPs with both real
  or complex linear diagonal recurrences leads to arbitrarily precise approximation
  of regular causal sequence-to-sequence maps. At the heart of our proof, we rely
  on a separation of concerns: the linear RNN provides a lossless encoding of the
  input sequence, and the MLP performs non-linear processing on this encoding. While
  we show that real diagonal linear recurrences are enough to achieve universality
  in this architecture, we prove that employing complex eigenvalues near unit disk
  - i.e., empirically the most successful strategy in S4 - greatly helps the RNN in
  storing information. We connect this finding with the vanishing gradient issue and
  provide experiments supporting our claims.'
