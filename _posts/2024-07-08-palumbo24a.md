title: 'Two Heads are Actually Better than One: Towards Better Adversarial Robustness
  via Transduction and Rejection'
openreview: vn92qYjL1F
abstract: Both transduction and rejection have emerged as important techniques for
  defending against adversarial perturbations. A recent work by Goldwasser et. al
  showed that rejection combined with transduction can give <em>provable</em> guarantees
  (for certain problems) that cannot be achieved otherwise. Nevertheless, under recent
  strong adversarial attacks (GMSA), Goldwasser et al.’s work was shown to have low
  performance in a practical deep-learning setting. In this paper, we take a step
  towards realizing the promise of transduction+rejection in more realistic scenarios.
  Our key observation is that a novel application of a reduction technique by Tramèr,
  which was until now only used to demonstrate the vulnerability of certain defenses,
  can be used to actually construct effective defenses. Theoretically, we show that
  a careful application of this technique in the transductive setting can give significantly
  improved sample-complexity for robust generalization. Our theory guides us to design
  a new transductive algorithm for learning a selective model; extensive experiments
  using state of the art attacks (AutoAttack, GMSA) show that our approach provides
  significantly better robust accuracy (81.6% on CIFAR-10 and 57.9% on CIFAR-100 under
  $l_\infty$ with budget 8/255) than existing techniques. The implementation is available
  at https://github.com/nilspalumbo/transduction-rejection.
