title: Preference Optimization for Molecule Synthesis with Conditional Residual Energy-based
  Models
openreview: oLfq1KKneW
abstract: Molecule synthesis through machine learning is one of the fundamental problems
  in drug discovery. Current data-driven strategies employ one-step retrosynthesis
  models and search algorithms to predict synthetic routes in a top-bottom manner.
  Despite their effective performance, these strategies face limitations in the molecule
  synthetic route generation due to a greedy selection of the next molecule set without
  any lookahead. Furthermore, existing strategies cannot control the generation of
  synthetic routes based on possible criteria such as material costs, yields, and
  step count. In this work, we propose a general and principled framework via conditional
  residual energy-based models (EBMs), that focus on the quality of the entire synthetic
  route based on the specific criteria. By incorporating an additional energy-based
  function into our probabilistic model, our proposed algorithm can enhance the quality
  of the most probable synthetic routes (with higher probabilities) generated by various
  strategies in a plug-and-play fashion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
  framework can consistently boost performance across various strategies and outperforms
  previous state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy by a margin of 2.5%. Code is available
