title: Learning Linear Block Error Correction Codes
openreview: Kf9CqdI8Rb
abstract: Error correction codes are a crucial part of the physical communication
  layer, ensuring the reliable transfer of data over noisy channels. The design of
  optimal linear block codes capable of being efficiently decoded is of major concern,
  especially for short block lengths. While neural decoders have recently demonstrated
  their advantage over classical decoding techniques, the neural design of the codes
  remains a challenge. In this work, we propose for the first time a unified encoder-decoder
  training of binary linear block codes. To this end, we adapt the coding setting
  to support efficient and differentiable training of the code for end-to-end optimization
  over the order two Galois field. We also propose a novel Transformer model in which
  the self-attention masking is performed in a differentiable fashion for the efficient
  backpropagation of the code gradient. Our results show that (i) the proposed decoder
  outperforms existing neural decoding on conventional codes, (ii) the suggested framework
  generates codes that outperform the analogous conventional codes, and (iii) the
  codes we developed not only excel with our decoder but also show enhanced performance
  with traditional decoding techniques.
