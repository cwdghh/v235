title: Learning Iterative Reasoning through Energy Diffusion
openreview: CduFAALvGe
abstract: 'We introduce iterative reasoning through energy diffusion (IRED), a novel
  framework for learning to reason for a variety of tasks by formulating reasoning
  and decision-making problems with energy-based optimization. IRED learns energy
  functions to represent the constraints between input conditions and desired outputs.
  After training, IRED adapts the number of optimization steps during inference based
  on problem difficulty, enabling it to solve problems outside its training distribution
  — such as more complex Sudoku puzzles, matrix completion with large value magnitudes,
  and path finding in larger graphs. Key to our method’s success is two novel techniques:
  learning a sequence of annealed energy landscapes for easier inference and a combination
  of score function and energy landscape supervision for faster and more stable training.
  Our experiments show that IRED outperforms existing methods in continuous-space
  reasoning, discrete-space reasoning, and planning tasks, particularly in more challenging
  scenarios.'
