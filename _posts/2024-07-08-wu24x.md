title: Policy Learning for Balancing Short-Term and Long-Term Rewards
openreview: 7Qf1uHTahP
abstract: Empirical researchers and decision-makers spanning various domains frequently
  seek profound insights into the long-term impacts of interventions. While the significance
  of long-term outcomes is undeniable, an overemphasis on them may inadvertently overshadow
  short-term gains. Motivated by this, this paper formalizes a new framework for learning
  the optimal policy that effectively balances both long-term and short-term rewards,
  where some long-term outcomes are allowed to be missing. In particular, we first
  present the identifiability of both rewards under mild assumptions. Next, we deduce
  the semiparametric efficiency bounds, along with the consistency and asymptotic
  normality of their estimators. We also reveal that short-term outcomes, if associated,
  contribute to improving the estimator of the long-term reward. Based on the proposed
  estimators, we develop a principled policy learning approach and further derive
  the convergence rates of regret and estimation errors associated with the learned
  policy. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the
  proposed method, demonstrating its practical applicability.
