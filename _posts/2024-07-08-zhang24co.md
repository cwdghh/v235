title: Transferable Facial Privacy Protection against Blind Face Restoration via Domain-Consistent
  Adversarial Obfuscation
openreview: st2BTty53v
abstract: 'With the rise of social media and the proliferation of facial recognition
  surveillance, concerns surrounding privacy have escalated significantly. While numerous
  studies have concentrated on safeguarding users against unauthorized face recognition,
  a new and often overlooked issue has emerged due to advances in facial restoration
  techniques: traditional methods of facial obfuscation may no longer provide a secure
  shield, as they can potentially expose anonymous information to human perception.
  Our empirical study shows that blind face restoration (BFR) models can restore obfuscated
  faces with high probability by simply retraining them on obfuscated (e.g., pixelated)
  faces. To address it, we propose a transferable adversarial obfuscation method for
  privacy protection against BFR models. Specifically, we observed a common characteristic
  among BFR models, namely, their capability to approximate an inverse mapping of
  a transformation from a high-quality image domain to a low-quality image domain.
  Leveraging this shared model attribute, we have developed a domain-consistent adversarial
  method for generating obfuscated images. In essence, our method is designed to minimize
  overfitting to surrogate models during the perturbation generation process, thereby
  enhancing the generalization of adversarial obfuscated facial images. Extensive
  experiments on various BFR models demonstrate the effectiveness and transferability
  of the proposed method.'
