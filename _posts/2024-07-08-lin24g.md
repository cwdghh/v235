title: Learning to Model the World With Language
openreview: 7dP6Yq9Uwv
abstract: 'To interact with humans and act in the world, agents need to understand
  the range of language that people use and relate it to the visual world. While current
  agents can learn to execute simple language instructions, we aim to build agents
  that leverage diverse language—language like "this button turns on the TV" or "I
  put the bowls away"—that conveys general knowledge, describes the state of the world,
  provides interactive feedback, and more. Our key idea is that <em>agents should
  interpret such diverse language as a signal that helps them predict the future</em>:
  what they will observe, how the world will behave, and which situations will be
  rewarded. This perspective unifies language understanding with future prediction
  as a powerful self-supervised learning objective. We instantiate this in Dynalang,
  an agent that learns a multimodal world model to predict future text and image representations,
  and learns to act from imagined model rollouts. While current methods that learn
  language-conditioned policies degrade in performance with more diverse types of
  language, we show that Dynalang learns to leverage environment descriptions, game
  rules, and instructions to excel on tasks ranging from game-playing to navigating
  photorealistic home scans. Finally, we show that our method enables additional capabilities
  due to learning a generative model: Dynalang can be pretrained on text-only data,
  enabling learning from offline datasets, and generate language grounded in an environment.'
