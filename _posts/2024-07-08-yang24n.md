title: Bounded and Uniform Energy-based Out-of-distribution Detection for Graphs
openreview: mjh7AOWozN
abstract: 'Given the critical role of graphs in real-world applications and their
  high-security requirements, improving the ability of graph neural networks (GNNs)
  to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) data is an urgent research problem. The recent
  work GNNSAFE proposes a framework based on the aggregation of negative energy scores
  that significantly improves the performance of GNNs to detect node-level OOD data.
  However, our study finds that score aggregation among nodes is susceptible to extreme
  values due to the unboundedness of the negative energy scores and logit shifts,
  which severely limits the accuracy of GNNs in detecting node-level OOD data. In
  this paper, we propose NODESAFE: reducing the generation of extreme scores of nodes
  by adding two optimization terms that make the negative energy scores bounded and
  mitigate the logit shift. Experimental results show that our approach dramatically
  improves the ability of GNNs to detect OOD data at the node level, e.g., in detecting
  OOD data induced by Structure Manipulation, the metric of FPR95 (lower is better)
  in scenarios without (with) OOD data exposure are reduced from the current SOTA
  by 28.4% ( 22.7% ). The code is available via https://github.com/ShenzhiYang2000/NODESAFE-Bounded-and-Uniform-Energy-based-Out-of-distribution-Detection-for-Graphs.'
