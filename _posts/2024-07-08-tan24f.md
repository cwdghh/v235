title: 'OTMatch: Improving Semi-Supervised Learning with Optimal Transport'
openreview: ShkKSDrfG6
abstract: Semi-supervised learning has made remarkable strides by effectively utilizing
  a limited amount of labeled data while capitalizing on the abundant information
  present in unlabeled data. However, current algorithms often prioritize aligning
  image predictions with specific classes generated through self-training techniques,
  thereby neglecting the inherent relationships that exist within these classes. In
  this paper, we present a new approach called OTMatch, which leverages semantic relationships
  among classes by employing an optimal transport loss function to match distributions.
  We conduct experiments on many standard vision and language datasets. The empirical
  results show improvements in our method above baseline, this demonstrates the effectiveness
  and superiority of our approach in harnessing semantic relationships to enhance
  learning performance in a semi-supervised setting.
