title: Agnostic Learning of Mixed Linear Regressions with EM and AM Algorithms
openreview: eo88noTbb5
abstract: Mixed linear regression is a well-studied problem in parametric statistics
  and machine learning. Given a set of samples, tuples of covariates and labels, the
  task of mixed linear regression is to find a small list of linear relationships
  that best fit the samples. Usually it is assumed that the label is generated stochastically
  by randomly selecting one of two or more linear functions, applying this chosen
  function to the covariates, and potentially introducing noise to the result. In
  that situation, the objective is to estimate the ground-truth linear functions up
  to some parameter error. The popular expectation maximization (EM) and alternating
  minimization (AM) algorithms have been previously analyzed for this. In this paper,
  we consider the more general problem of agnostic learning of mixed linear regression
  from samples, without such generative models. In particular, we show that the AM
  and EM algorithms, under standard conditions of separability and good initialization,
  lead to agnostic learning in mixed linear regression by converging to the population
  loss minimizers, for suitably defined loss functions. In some sense, this shows
  the strength of AM and EM algorithms that converges to “optimal solutions” even
  in the absence of realizable generative models.
