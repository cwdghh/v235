title: Fourier Controller Networks for Real-Time Decision-Making in Embodied Learning
openreview: nDps3Q8j2l
abstract: Transformer has shown promise in reinforcement learning to model time-varying
  features for obtaining generalized low-level robot policies on diverse robotics
  datasets in embodied learning. However, it still suffers from the issues of low
  data efficiency and high inference latency. In this paper, we propose to investigate
  the task from a new perspective of the frequency domain. We first observe that the
  energy density in the frequency domain of a robot’s trajectory is mainly concentrated
  in the low-frequency part. Then, we present the Fourier Controller Network (FCNet),
  a new network that uses Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to extract and encode
  time-varying features through frequency domain interpolation. In order to do real-time
  decision-making, we further adopt FFT and Sliding DFT methods in the model architecture
  to achieve parallel training and efficient recurrent inference. Extensive results
  in both simulated (e.g., D4RL) and real-world environments (e.g., robot locomotion)
  demonstrate FCNet’s substantial efficiency and effectiveness over existing methods
  such as Transformer, e.g., FCNet outperforms Transformer on multi-environmental
  robotics datasets of all types of sizes (from 1.9M to 120M). The project page and
  code can be found https://thkkk.github.io/fcnet.
