title: Rich-Observation Reinforcement Learning with Continuous Latent Dynamics
openreview: Gq1ajaKhBC
abstract: Sample-efficiency and reliability remain major bottlenecks toward wide adoption
  of reinforcement learning algorithms in continuous settings with high-dimensional
  perceptual inputs. Toward addressing these challenges, we introduce a new theoretical
  framework, <b>RichCLD</b> (“Rich-Observation RL with Continuous Latent Dynamics”),
  in which the agent performs control based on high-dimensional observations, but
  the environment is governed by low-dimensional latent states and Lipschitz continuous
  dynamics. Our main contribution is a new algorithm for this setting that is provably
  statistically and computationally efficient. The core of our algorithm is a new
  representation learning objective; we show that prior representation learning schemes
  tailored to discrete dynamics do not naturally extend to the continuous setting.
  Our new objective is amenable to practical implementation, and empirically, we find
  that it compares favorably to prior schemes in a standard evaluation protocol. We
  further provide several insights into the statistical complexity of the <b>RichCLD</b>
  framework, in particular proving that certain notions of Lipschitzness that admit
  sample-efficient learning in the absence of rich observations are insufficient in
  the rich-observation setting.
