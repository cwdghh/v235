title: Statistically Optimal Generative Modeling with Maximum Deviation from the Empirical
  Distribution
openreview: 3ash2ksk1r
abstract: This paper explores the problem of generative modeling, aiming to simulate
  diverse examples from an unknown distribution based on observed examples. While
  recent studies have focused on quantifying the statistical precision of popular
  algorithms, there is a lack of mathematical evaluation regarding the non-replication
  of observed examples and the creativity of the generative model. We present theoretical
  insights into this aspect, demonstrating that the Wasserstein GAN, constrained to
  left-invertible push-forward maps, generates distributions that not only avoid replication
  but also significantly deviate from the empirical distribution. Importantly, we
  show that left-invertibility achieves this without compromising the statistical
  optimality of the resulting generator. Our most important contribution provides
  a finite-sample lower bound on the Wasserstein-1 distance between the generative
  distribution and the empirical one. We also establish a finite-sample upper bound
  on the distance between the generative distribution and the true data-generating
  one. Both bounds are explicit and show the impact of key parameters such as sample
  size, dimensions of the ambient and latent spaces, noise level, and smoothness measured
  by the Lipschitz constant.
