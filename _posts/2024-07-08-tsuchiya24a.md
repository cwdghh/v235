title: 'Exploration by Optimization with Hybrid Regularizers: Logarithmic Regret with
  Adversarial Robustness in Partial Monitoring'
openreview: dplgaRn4Ae
abstract: Partial monitoring is a generic framework of online decision-making problems
  with limited feedback. To make decisions from such limited feedback, it is necessary
  to find an appropriate distribution for exploration. Recently, a powerful approach
  for this purpose, exploration by optimization (ExO), was proposed, which achieves
  optimal bounds in adversarial environments with follow-the-regularized-leader for
  a wide range of online decision-making problems. However, a naive application of
  ExO in stochastic environments significantly degrades regret bounds. To resolve
  this issue in locally observable games, we first establish a new framework and analysis
  for ExO with a hybrid regularizer. This development allows us to significantly improve
  existing regret bounds of best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithms, which achieves
  nearly optimal bounds both in stochastic and adversarial environments. In particular,
  we derive a stochastic regret bound of $O(\sum_{a \neq a^*} k^2 m^2 \log T / \Delta_a)$,
  where $k$, $m$, and $T$ are the numbers of actions, observations and rounds, $a^*$
  is an optimal action, and $\Delta_a$ is the suboptimality gap for action $a$. This
  bound is roughly $\Theta(k^2 \log T)$ times smaller than existing BOBW bounds. In
  addition, for globally observable games, we provide a new BOBW algorithm with the
  first $O(\log T)$ stochastic bound.
