title: Resisting Stochastic Risks in Diffusion Planners with the Trajectory Aggregation
  Tree
openreview: NbYAmsFJrc
abstract: Diffusion planners have shown promise in handling long-horizon and sparse-reward
  tasks due to the non-autoregressive plan generation. However, their inherent stochastic
  risk of generating infeasible trajectories presents significant challenges to their
  reliability and stability. We introduce a novel approach, the Trajectory Aggregation
  Tree (TAT), to address this issue in diffusion planners. Compared to prior methods
  that rely solely on raw trajectory predictions, TAT aggregates information from
  both historical and current trajectories, forming a dynamic tree-like structure.
  Each trajectory is conceptualized as a branch and individual states as nodes. As
  the structure evolves with the integration of new trajectories, unreliable states
  are marginalized, and the most impactful nodes are prioritized for decision-making.
  TAT can be deployed without modifying the original training and sampling pipelines
  of diffusion planners, making it a training-free, ready-to-deploy solution. We provide
  both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to support TATâ€™s effectiveness.
  Our results highlight its remarkable ability to resist the risk from unreliable
  trajectories, guarantee the performance boosting of diffusion planners in 100% of
  tasks, and exhibit an appreciable tolerance margin for sample quality, thereby enabling
  planning with a more than $3\times$ acceleration.
