title: Principled Preferential Bayesian Optimization
openreview: YqMOM5W9GF
abstract: We study the problem of preferential Bayesian optimization (BO), where we
  aim to optimize a black-box function with only preference feedback over a pair of
  candidate solutions. Inspired by the likelihood ratio idea, we construct a confidence
  set of the black-box function using only the preference feedback. An optimistic
  algorithm with an efficient computational method is then developed to solve the
  problem, which enjoys an information-theoretic bound on the total cumulative regret,
  a first-of-its-kind for preferential BO. This bound further allows us to design
  a scheme to report an estimated best solution, with a guaranteed convergence rate.
  Experimental results on sampled instances from Gaussian processes, standard test
  functions, and a thermal comfort optimization problem all show that our method stably
  achieves better or competitive performance as compared to the existing state-of-the-art
  heuristics, which, however, do not have theoretical guarantees on regret bounds
  or convergence.
