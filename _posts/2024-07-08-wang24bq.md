title: 'AD3: Implicit Action is the Key for World Models to Distinguish the Diverse
  Visual Distractors'
openreview: ZwrfsrCduj
abstract: Model-based methods have significantly contributed to distinguishing task-irrelevant
  distractors for visual control. However, prior research has primarily focused on
  heterogeneous distractors like noisy background videos, leaving homogeneous distractors
  that closely resemble controllable agents largely unexplored, which poses significant
  challenges to existing methods. To tackle this problem, we propose Implicit Action
  Generator (IAG) to learn the implicit actions of visual distractors, and present
  a new algorithm named implicit Action-informed Diverse visual Distractors Distinguisher
  (AD3), that leverages the action inferred by IAG to train separated world models.
  Implicit actions effectively capture the behavior of background distractors, aiding
  in distinguishing the task-irrelevant components, and the agent can optimize the
  policy within the task-relevant state space. Our method achieves superior performance
  on various visual control tasks featuring both heterogeneous and homogeneous distractors.
  The indispensable role of implicit actions learned by IAG is also empirically validated.
