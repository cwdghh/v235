title: Learning High-Order Relationships of Brain Regions
openreview: WC14xZIaC2
abstract: Discovering reliable and informative relationships among brain regions from
  functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals is essential in phenotypic
  predictions in neuroscience. Most of the current methods fail to accurately characterize
  those interactions because they only focus on pairwise connections and overlook
  the high-order relationships of brain regions. We propose that these high-order
  relationships should be <em>maximally informative and minimally redundant</em> (MIMR).
  However, identifying such high-order relationships is challenging and under-explored
  due to the exponential search space and the absence of a tractable objective. In
  response to this gap, we propose a novel method named HyBRiD, which aims to extract
  MIMR high-order relationships from fMRI data. HyBRiD employs a Constructor to identify
  hyperedge structures, and a Weighter to compute a weight for each hyperedge, which
  avoids searching in exponential space. HyBRiD achieves the MIMR objective through
  an innovative information bottleneck framework named multi-head drop-bottleneck
  with theoretical guarantees. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our model. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art predictive model by an
  average of 11.2%, regarding the quality of hyperedges measured by CPM, a standard
  protocol for studying brain connections.
