title: 'ALERT-Transformer: Bridging Asynchronous and Synchronous Machine Learning
  for Real-Time Event-based Spatio-Temporal Data'
openreview: 8ZDFn7BDaH
abstract: 'We seek to enable classic processing of continuous ultra-sparse spatiotemporal
  data generated by event-based sensors with dense machine learning models. We propose
  a novel hybrid pipeline composed of asynchronous sensing and synchronous processing
  that combines several ideas: (1) an embedding based on PointNet models – the ALERT
  module – that can continuously integrate new and dismiss old events thanks to a
  leakage mechanism, (2) a flexible readout of the embedded data that allows to feed
  any downstream model with always up-to-date features at any sampling rate, (3) exploiting
  the input sparsity in a patch-based approach inspired by Vision Transformer to optimize
  the efficiency of the method. These embeddings are then processed by a transformer
  model trained for object and gesture recognition. Using this approach, we achieve
  performances at the state-of-the-art with a lower latency than competitors. We also
  demonstrate that our asynchronous model can operate at any desired sampling rate.'
