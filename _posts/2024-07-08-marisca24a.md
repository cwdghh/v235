title: Graph-based Forecasting with Missing Data through Spatiotemporal Downsampling
openreview: uYIFQOtb58
abstract: Given a set of synchronous time series, each associated with a sensor-point
  in space and characterized by inter-series relationships, the problem of spatiotemporal
  forecasting consists of predicting future observations for each point. Spatiotemporal
  graph neural networks achieve striking results by representing the relationships
  across time series as a graph. Nonetheless, most existing methods rely on the often
  unrealistic assumption that inputs are always available and fail to capture hidden
  spatiotemporal dynamics when part of the data is missing. In this work, we tackle
  this problem through hierarchical spatiotemporal downsampling. The input time series
  are progressively coarsened over time and space, obtaining a pool of representations
  that capture heterogeneous temporal and spatial dynamics. Conditioned on observations
  and missing data patterns, such representations are combined by an interpretable
  attention mechanism to generate the forecasts. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art
  methods on synthetic and real-world benchmarks under different missing data distributions,
  particularly in the presence of contiguous blocks of missing values.
