title: 'Switched Flow Matching: Eliminating Singularities via Switching ODEs'
openreview: 2ulUrcOZ64
abstract: Continuous-time generative models, such as Flow Matching (FM), construct
  probability paths to transport between one distribution and another through the
  simulation-free learning of the neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). During
  inference, however, the learned model often requires multiple neural network evaluations
  to accurately integrate the flow, resulting in a slow sampling speed. We attribute
  the reason to the inherent (joint) heterogeneity of source and/or target distributions,
  namely the singularity problem, which poses challenges for training the neural ODEs
  effectively. To address this issue, we propose a more general framework, termed
  Switched FM (SFM), that eliminates singularities via switching ODEs, as opposed
  to using a uniform ODE in FM. Importantly, we theoretically show that FM cannot
  transport between two simple distributions due to the existence and uniqueness of
  initial value problems of ODEs, while these limitations can be well tackled by SFM.
  From an orthogonal perspective, our framework can seamlessly integrate with the
  existing advanced techniques, such as minibatch optimal transport, to further enhance
  the straightness of the flow, yielding a more efficient sampling process with reduced
  costs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the newly proposed SFM through several
  numerical examples.
