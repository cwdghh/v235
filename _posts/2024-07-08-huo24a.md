title: Token-Specific Watermarking with Enhanced Detectability and Semantic Coherence
  for Large Language Models
openreview: AqBz54aFyj
abstract: Large language models generate high-quality responses with potential misinformation,
  underscoring the need for regulation by distinguishing AI-generated and human-written
  texts. Watermarking is pivotal in this context, which involves embedding hidden
  markers in texts during the LLM inference phase, which is imperceptible to humans.
  Achieving both the detectability of inserted watermarks and the semantic quality
  of generated texts is challenging. While current watermarking algorithms have made
  promising progress in this direction, there remains significant scope for improvement.
  To address these challenges, we introduce a novel multi-objective optimization (MOO)
  approach for watermarking that utilizes lightweight networks to generate token-specific
  watermarking logits and splitting ratios. By leveraging MOO to optimize for both
  detection and semantic objective functions, our method simultaneously achieves detectability
  and semantic integrity. Experimental results show that our method outperforms current
  watermarking techniques in enhancing the detectability of texts generated by LLMs
  while maintaining their semantic coherence. Our code is available at https://github.com/mignonjia/TS_watermark.
