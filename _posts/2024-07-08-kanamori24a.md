title: Learning Decision Trees and Forests with Algorithmic Recourse
openreview: blGpu9aGs6
abstract: This paper proposes a new algorithm for learning accurate tree-based models
  while ensuring the existence of recourse actions. Algorithmic Recourse (AR) aims
  to provide a recourse action for altering the undesired prediction result given
  by a model. Typical AR methods provide a reasonable action by solving an optimization
  task of minimizing the required effort among executable actions. In practice, however,
  such actions do not always exist for models optimized only for predictive performance.
  To alleviate this issue, we formulate the task of learning an accurate classification
  tree under the constraint of ensuring the existence of reasonable actions for as
  many instances as possible. Then, we propose an efficient top-down greedy algorithm
  by leveraging the adversarial training techniques. We also show that our proposed
  algorithm can be applied to the random forest, which is known as a popular framework
  for learning tree ensembles. Experimental results demonstrated that our method successfully
  provided reasonable actions to more instances than the baselines without significantly
  degrading accuracy and computational efficiency.
