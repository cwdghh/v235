title: Symbolic Music Generation with Non-Differentiable Rule Guided Diffusion
openreview: g8AigOTNXL
abstract: We study the problem of symbolic music generation (e.g., generating piano
  rolls), with a technical focus on non-differentiable rule guidance. Musical rules
  are often expressed in symbolic form on note characteristics, such as note density
  or chord progression, many of which are non-differentiable which pose a challenge
  when using them for guided diffusion. We propose Stochastic Control Guidance (SCG),
  a novel guidance method that only requires forward evaluation of rule functions
  that can work with pre-trained diffusion models in a plug-and-play way, thus achieving
  training-free guidance for non-differentiable rules for the first time. Additionally,
  we introduce a latent diffusion architecture for symbolic music generation with
  high time resolution, which can be composed with SCG in a plug-and-play fashion.
  Compared to standard strong baselines in symbolic music generation, this framework
  demonstrates marked advancements in music quality and rule-based controllability,
  outperforming current state-of-the-art generators in a variety of settings. For
  detailed demonstrations, code and model checkpoints, please visit our project website.
