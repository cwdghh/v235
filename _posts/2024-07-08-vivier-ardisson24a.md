title: 'CF-OPT: Counterfactual Explanations for Structured Prediction'
openreview: xSkIxKdO08
abstract: 'Optimization layers in deep neural networks have enjoyed a growing popularity
  in structured learning, improving the state of the art on a variety of applications.
  Yet, these pipelines lack interpretability since they are made of two opaque layers:
  a highly non-linear prediction model, such as a deep neural network, and an optimization
  layer, which is typically a complex black-box solver. Our goal is to improve the
  transparency of such methods by providing counterfactual explanations. We build
  upon variational autoencoders a principled way of obtaining counterfactuals: working
  in the latent space leads to a natural notion of plausibility of explanations. We
  finally introduce a variant of the classic loss for VAE training that improves their
  performance in our specific structured context. These provide the foundations of
  CF-OPT, a first-order optimization algorithm that can find counterfactual explanations
  for a broad class of structured learning architectures. Our numerical results show
  that both close and plausible explanations can be obtained for problems from the
  recent literature.'
