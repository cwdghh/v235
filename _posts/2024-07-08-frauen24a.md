title: Fair Off-Policy Learning from Observational Data
openreview: poEPRuNvM3
abstract: 'Algorithmic decision-making in practice must be fair for legal, ethical,
  and societal reasons. To achieve this, prior research has contributed various approaches
  that ensure fairness in machine learning predictions, while comparatively little
  effort has focused on fairness in decision-making, specifically off-policy learning.
  In this paper, we propose a novel framework for fair off-policy learning: we learn
  decision rules from observational data under different notions of fairness, where
  we explicitly assume that observational data were collected under a different –
  potentially discriminatory – behavioral policy. Importantly, our framework applies
  to different fairness notions for off-policy learning, where fairness is formalized
  based on actions or policy values. As our main contribution, we propose a neural
  network-based framework to learn optimal policies under different fairness notions.
  We further provide theoretical guarantees in the form of generalization bounds for
  the finite-sample version of our framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
  our framework through extensive numerical experiments using both simulated and real-world
  data. Altogether, our work enables algorithmic decision-making in a wide array of
  practical applications where fairness must be ensured.'
