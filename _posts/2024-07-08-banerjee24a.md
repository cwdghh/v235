title: Relational DNN Verification With Cross Executional Bound Refinement
openreview: HOG80Yk4Gw
abstract: We focus on verifying relational properties defined over deep neural networks
  (DNNs) such as robustness against universal adversarial perturbations (UAP), certified
  worst-case hamming distance for binary string classifications, etc. Precise verification
  of these properties requires reasoning about multiple executions of the same DNN.
  However, most of the existing works in DNN verification only handle properties defined
  over single executions and as a result, are imprecise for relational properties.
  Though few recent works for relational DNN verification, capture linear dependencies
  between the inputs of multiple executions, they do not leverage dependencies between
  the outputs of hidden layers producing imprecise results. We develop a scalable
  relational verifier RACoon that utilizes cross-execution dependencies at all layers
  of the DNN gaining substantial precision over SOTA baselines on a wide range of
  datasets, networks, and relational properties.
