title: 'BOtied: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization with tied multivariate ranks'
openreview: cj5HbaX14p
abstract: Many scientific and industrial applications require the joint optimization
  of multiple, potentially competing objectives. Multi-objective Bayesian optimization
  (MOBO) is a sample-efficient framework for identifying Pareto-optimal solutions.
  At the heart of MOBO is the acquisition function, which determines the next candidate
  to evaluate by navigating the best compromises among the objectives. Acquisition
  functions that rely on integrating over the objective space scale poorly to a large
  number of objectives. In this paper, we show a natural connection between the non-dominated
  solutions and the highest multivariate rank, which coincides with the extreme level
  line of the joint cumulative distribution function (CDF). Motivated by this link,
  we propose the CDF indicator, a Pareto-compliant metric for evaluating the quality
  of approximate Pareto sets, that can complement the popular hypervolume indicator.
  We then introduce an acquisition function based on the CDF indicator, called BOtied.
  BOtied can be implemented efficiently with copulas, a statistical tool for modeling
  complex, high-dimensional distributions. Our experiments on a variety of synthetic
  and real-world experiments demonstrate that BOtied outperforms state-of-the-art
  MOBO algorithms while being computationally efficient for many objectives.
