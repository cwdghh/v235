title: Learning the Target Network in Function Space
openreview: jP1zeEqHli
abstract: We focus on the task of learning the value function in the reinforcement
  learning (RL) setting. This task is often solved by updating a pair of online and
  target networks while ensuring that the parameters of these two networks are equivalent.
  We propose Lookahead-Replicate (LR), a new value-function approximation algorithm
  that is agnostic to this parameter-space equivalence. Instead, the LR algorithm
  is designed to maintain an equivalence between the two networks in the function
  space. This value-based equivalence is obtained by employing a new target-network
  update. We show that LR leads to a convergent behavior in learning the value function.
  We also present empirical results demonstrating that LR-based target-network updates
  significantly improve deep RL on the Atari benchmark.
