title: Robust Optimization in Protein Fitness Landscapes Using Reinforcement Learning
  in Latent Space
openreview: 0zbxwvJqwf
abstract: Proteins are complex molecules responsible for different functions in nature.
  Enhancing the functionality of proteins and cellular fitness can significantly impact
  various industries. However, protein optimization using computational methods remains
  challenging, especially when starting from low-fitness sequences. We propose LatProtRL,
  an optimization method to efficiently traverse a latent space learned by an encoder-decoder
  leveraging a large protein language model. To escape local optima, our optimization
  is modeled as a Markov decision process using reinforcement learning acting directly
  in latent space. We evaluate our approach on two important fitness optimization
  tasks, demonstrating its ability to achieve comparable or superior fitness over
  baseline methods. Our findings and in vitro evaluation show that the generated sequences
  can reach high-fitness regions, suggesting a substantial potential of LatProtRL
  in lab-in-the-loop scenarios.
