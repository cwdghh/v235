title: 'PAGER: Accurate Failure Characterization in Deep Regression Models'
openreview: 5353dJE9Ek
abstract: Safe deployment of AI models requires proactive detection of failures to
  prevent costly errors. To this end, we study the important problem of detecting
  failures in deep regression models. Existing approaches rely on epistemic uncertainty
  estimates or inconsistency w.r.t the training data to identify failure. Interestingly,
  we find that while uncertainties are necessary they are insufficient to accurately
  characterize failure in practice. Hence, we introduce PAGER (Principled Analysis
  of Generalization Errors in Regressors), a framework to systematically detect and
  characterize failures in deep regressors. Built upon the principle of anchored training
  in deep models, PAGER unifies both epistemic uncertainty and complementary manifold
  non-conformity scores to accurately organize samples into different risk regimes.
