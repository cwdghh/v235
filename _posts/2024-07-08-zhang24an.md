title: 'MagicLens: Self-Supervised Image Retrieval with Open-Ended Instructions'
openreview: Zc22RDtsvP
abstract: 'Image retrieval, i.e., finding desired images given a reference image,
  inherently encompasses rich, multi-faceted search intents that are difficult to
  capture solely using image-based measures. Recent works leverage text instructions
  to allow users to more freely express their search intents. However, they primarily
  focus on image pairs that are visually similar and/or can be characterized by a
  small set of pre-defined relations. The core thesis of this paper is that text instructions
  can enable retrieving images with richer relations beyond visual similarity. To
  show this, we introduce MagicLens, a series of self-supervised image retrieval models
  that support open-ended instructions. MagicLens is built on a key novel insight:
  image pairs that naturally occur on the same web pages contain a wide range of implicit
  relations (e.g., inside view of), and we can bring those implicit relations explicit
  by synthesizing instructions via foundation models. Trained on 36.7M (query image,
  instruction, target image) triplets with rich semantic relations mined from the
  web, MagicLens achieves results comparable with or better than prior best on eight
  benchmarks of various image retrieval tasks, while maintaining high parameter efficiency
  with a significantly smaller model size. Additional human analyses on a 1.4M-image
  unseen corpus further demonstrate the diversity of search intents supported by MagicLens.
  Code and models are publicly available at the https://open-vision-language.github.io/MagicLens/.'
