title: Recurrent Distance Filtering for Graph Representation Learning
openreview: 5kGfm3Pa41
abstract: 'Graph neural networks based on iterative one-hop message passing have been
  shown to struggle in harnessing the information from distant nodes effectively.
  Conversely, graph transformers allow each node to attend to all other nodes directly,
  but lack graph inductive bias and have to rely on ad-hoc positional encoding. In
  this paper, we propose a new architecture to reconcile these challenges. Our approach
  stems from the recent breakthroughs in long-range modeling provided by deep state-space
  models: for a given target node, our model aggregates other nodes by their shortest
  distances to the target and uses a linear RNN to encode the sequence of hop representations.
  The linear RNN is parameterized in a particular diagonal form for stable long-range
  signal propagation and is theoretically expressive enough to encode the neighborhood
  hierarchy. With no need for positional encoding, we empirically show that the performance
  of our model is comparable to or better than that of state-of-the-art graph transformers
  on various benchmarks, with a significantly reduced computational cost. Our code
  is open-source at https://github.com/skeletondyh/GRED.'
