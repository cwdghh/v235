title: Conformalized Adaptive Forecasting of Heterogeneous Trajectories
openreview: nbpwNmXTTw
abstract: This paper presents a new conformal method for generating <em>simultaneous</em>
  forecasting bands guaranteed to cover the <em>entire path</em> of a new random trajectory
  with sufficiently high probability. Prompted by the need for dependable uncertainty
  estimates in motion planning applications where the behavior of diverse objects
  may be more or less unpredictable, we blend different techniques from online conformal
  prediction of single and multiple time series, as well as ideas for addressing heteroscedasticity
  in regression. This solution is both principled, providing precise finite-sample
  guarantees, and effective, often leading to more informative predictions than prior
  methods.
