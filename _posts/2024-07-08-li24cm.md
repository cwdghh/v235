title: Predicting and Interpreting Energy Barriers of Metallic Glasses with Graph
  Neural Networks
openreview: 7rTbqkKvA6
abstract: Metallic Glasses (MGs) are widely used materials that are stronger than
  steel while being shapeable as plastic. While understanding the structure-property
  relationship of MGs remains a challenge in materials science, studying their energy
  barriers (EBs) as an intermediary step shows promise. In this work, we utilize Graph
  Neural Networks (GNNs) to model MGs and study EBs. We contribute a new dataset for
  EB prediction and a novel Symmetrized GNN (SymGNN) model that is E(3)-invariant
  in expectation. SymGNN handles invariance by aggregating over orthogonal transformations
  of the graph structure. When applied to EB prediction, SymGNN are more accurate
  than molecular dynamics (MD) local-sampling methods and other machine-learning models.
  Compared to precise MD simulations, SymGNN reduces the inference time on new MGs
  from roughly <b>41 days</b> to <b>less than one second</b>. We apply explanation
  algorithms to reveal the relationship between structures and EBs. The structures
  that we identify through explanations match the medium-range order (MRO) hypothesis
  and possess unique topological properties. Our work enables effective prediction
  and interpretation of MG EBs, bolstering material science research.
