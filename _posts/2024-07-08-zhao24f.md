title: 'VideoPrism: A Foundational Visual Encoder for Video Understanding'
openreview: oBP8vXFJNQ
abstract: We introduce VideoPrism, a general-purpose video encoder that tackles diverse
  video understanding tasks with a single frozen model. We pretrain VideoPrism on
  a heterogeneous corpus containing 36M high-quality video-caption pairs and 582M
  video clips with noisy parallel text (e.g., ASR transcripts). The pretraining approach
  improves upon masked autoencoding by global-local distillation of semantic video
  embeddings and a token shuffling scheme, enabling VideoPrism to focus primarily
  on the video modality while leveraging the invaluable text associated with videos.
  We extensively test VideoPrism on four broad groups of video understanding tasks,
  from web video question answering to CV for science, achieving state-of-the-art
  performance on 31 out of 33 video understanding benchmarks.
