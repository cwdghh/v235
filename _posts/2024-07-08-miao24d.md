title: 'DFlow: A Generative Model Combining Denoising AutoEncoder and Normalizing
  Flow for High Fidelity Waveform Generation'
openreview: AFAX28TdO4
abstract: In this work, we present DFlow, a novel generative framework that combines
  Normalizing Flow (NF) with a Denoising AutoEncoder (DAE), for high-fidelity waveform
  generation. With a tactfully designed structure, DFlow seamlessly integrates the
  capabilities of both NF and DAE, resulting in a significantly improved performance
  compared to the standard NF models. Experimental results showcase DFlowâ€™s superiority,
  achieving the highest MOS score among the existing methods on commonly used datasets
  and the fastest synthesis speed among all likelihood models. We further demonstrate
  the generalization ability of DFlow by generating high-quality out-of-distribution
  audio samples, such as singing and music audio. Additionally, we extend the model
  capacity of DFlow by scaling up both the model size and training set size. Our large-scale
  universal vocoder, DFlow-XL, achieves highly competitive performance against the
  best universal vocoder, BigVGAN.
