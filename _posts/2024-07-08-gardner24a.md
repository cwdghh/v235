title: 'LLark: A Multimodal Instruction-Following Language Model for Music'
openreview: HvwOtYzHBX
abstract: Music has a unique and complex structure which is challenging for both expert
  humans and existing AI systems to understand, and presents unique challenges relative
  to other forms of audio. We present LLark, an instruction-tuned multimodal model
  for <em>music</em> understanding. We detail our process for dataset creation, which
  involves augmenting the annotations of diverse open-source music datasets and converting
  them to a unified instruction-tuning format. We propose a multimodal architecture
  for LLark, integrating a pretrained generative model for music with a pretrained
  language model. In evaluations on three types of tasks (music understanding, captioning,
  reasoning), we show that LLark matches or outperforms existing baselines in music
  understanding, and that humans show a high degree of agreement with its responses
  in captioning and reasoning tasks. LLark is trained entirely from open-source music
  data and models, and we make our training code available along with the release
  of this paper. Additional results and audio examples are at https://bit.ly/llark,
  and our source code is available at https://github.com/spotify-research/llark.
