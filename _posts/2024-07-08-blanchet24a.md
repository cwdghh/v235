title: Stability Evaluation through Distributional Perturbation Analysis
openreview: XPP6K57bop
abstract: The performance of learning models often deteriorates when deployed in out-of-sample
  environments. To ensure reliable deployment, we propose a stability evaluation criterion
  based on distributional perturbations. Conceptually, our stability evaluation criterion
  is defined as the minimal perturbation required on our observed dataset to induce
  a prescribed deterioration in risk evaluation. In this paper, we utilize the optimal
  transport (OT) discrepancy with moment constraints on the (sample, density) space
  to quantify this perturbation. Therefore, our stability evaluation criterion can
  address both data corruptions and sub-population shifts—the two most common types
  of distribution shifts in real-world scenarios. To further realize practical benefits,
  we present a series of tractable convex formulations and computational methods tailored
  to different classes of loss functions. The key technical tool to achieve this is
  the strong duality theorem provided in this paper. Empirically, we validate the
  practical utility of our stability evaluation criterion across a host of real-world
  applications. These empirical studies showcase the criterion’s ability not only
  to compare the stability of different learning models and features but also to provide
  valuable guidelines and strategies to further improve models.
