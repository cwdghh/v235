title: 'Position: Levels of AGI for Operationalizing Progress on the Path to AGI'
openreview: 0ofzEysK2D
abstract: We propose a framework for classifying the capabilities and behavior of
  Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) models and their precursors. This framework
  introduces levels of AGI performance, generality, and autonomy, providing a common
  language to compare models, assess risks, and measure progress along the path to
  AGI. To develop our framework, we analyze existing definitions of AGI, and distill
  six principles that a useful ontology for AGI should satisfy. With these principles
  in mind, we propose “Levels of AGI” based on depth (performance) and breadth (generality)
  of capabilities, and reflect on how current systems fit into this ontology. We discuss
  the challenging requirements for future benchmarks that quantify the behavior and
  capabilities of AGI models against these levels. Finally, we discuss how these levels
  of AGI interact with deployment considerations such as autonomy and risk, and emphasize
  the importance of carefully selecting Human-AI Interaction paradigms for responsible
  and safe deployment of highly capable AI systems.
