title: Enhancing Value Function Estimation through First-Order State-Action Dynamics
  in Offline Reinforcement Learning
openreview: nSGnx8lNJ6
abstract: In offline reinforcement learning (RL), updating the value function with
  the discrete-time Bellman Equation often encounters challenges due to the limited
  scope of available data. This limitation stems from the Bellman Equation, which
  cannot accurately predict the value of unvisited states. To address this issue,
  we have introduced an innovative solution that bridges the continuous- and discrete-time
  RL methods, capitalizing on their advantages. Our method uses a discrete-time RL
  algorithm to derive the value function from a dataset while ensuring that the functionâ€™s
  first derivative aligns with the local characteristics of states and actions, as
  defined by the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in continuous RL. We provide practical
  algorithms for both deterministic policy gradient methods and stochastic policy
  gradient methods. Experiments on the D4RL dataset show that incorporating the first-order
  information significantly improves policy performance for offline RL problems.
