title: Learning to Predict Mutational Effects of Protein-Protein Interactions by Microenvironment-aware
  Hierarchical Prompt Learning
openreview: g89jAdrnAF
abstract: 'Protein-protein bindings play a key role in a variety of fundamental biological
  processes, and thus predicting the effects of amino acid mutations on protein-protein
  binding is crucial. To tackle the scarcity of annotated mutation data, pre-training
  with massive unlabeled data has emerged as a promising solution. However, this process
  faces a series of challenges: (1) complex higher-order dependencies among multiple
  (more than paired) structural scales have not yet been fully captured; (2) it is
  rarely explored how mutations alter the local conformation of the surrounding microenvironment;
  (3) pre-training is costly, both in data size and computational burden. In this
  paper, we first construct a hierarchical prompt codebook to record common microenvironmental
  patterns at different structural scales independently. Then, we develop a novel
  codebook pre-training task, namely masked microenvironment modeling, to model the
  joint distribution of each mutation with their residue types, angular statistics,
  and local conformational changes in the microenvironment. With the constructed prompt
  codebook, we encode the microenvironment around each mutation into multiple hierarchical
  prompts and combine them to flexibly provide information to wild-type and mutated
  protein complexes about their microenvironmental differences. Such a hierarchical
  prompt learning framework has demonstrated superior performance and training efficiency
  over state-of-the-art pre-training-based methods in mutation effect prediction and
  a case study of optimizing human antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.'
