title: 'Towards an Understanding of Stepwise Inference in Transformers: A Synthetic
  Graph Navigation Model'
openreview: 8VEGkphQaK
abstract: 'Stepwise inference protocols, such as scratchpads and chain-of-thought,
  help language models solve complex problems by decomposing them into a sequence
  of simpler subproblems. To unravel the underlying mechanisms of stepwise inference
  we propose to study autoregressive Transformer models on a synthetic task that embodies
  the multi-step nature of problems where stepwise inference is generally most useful.
  Specifically, we define a graph navigation problem wherein a model is tasked with
  traversing a path from a start to a goal node on the graph. We find we can empirically
  reproduce and analyze several phenomena observed at scale: (i) the stepwise inference
  reasoning gap, the cause of which we find in the structure of the training data;
  (ii) a diversity-accuracy trade-off in model generations as sampling temperature
  varies; (iii) a simplicity bias in the modelâ€™s output; and (iv) compositional generalization
  and a primacy bias with in-context exemplars. Overall, our work introduces a grounded,
  synthetic framework for studying stepwise inference and offers mechanistic hypotheses
  that can lay the foundation for a deeper understanding of this phenomenon.'
