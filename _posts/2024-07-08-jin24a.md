title: 'Homomorphism Counts for Graph Neural Networks: All About That Basis'
openreview: zRrzSLwNHQ
abstract: A large body of work has investigated the properties of graph neural networks
  and identified several limitations, particularly pertaining to their expressive
  power. Their inability to count certain <em>patterns</em> (e.g., cycles) in a graph
  lies at the heart of such limitations, since many functions to be learned rely on
  the ability of counting such patterns. Two prominent paradigms aim to address this
  limitation by enriching the graph features with <em>subgraph</em> or <em>homomorphism</em>
  pattern counts. In this work, we show that both of these approaches are sub-optimal
  in a certain sense and argue for a more <em>fine-grained</em> approach, which incorporates
  the homomorphism counts of <em>all</em> structures in the “basis” of the target
  pattern. This yields strictly more expressive architectures without incurring any
  additional overhead in terms of computational complexity compared to existing approaches.
  We prove a series of theoretical results on node-level and graph-level <em>motif
  parameters</em> and empirically validate them on standard benchmark datasets.
