title: 'Confronting Reward Overoptimization for Diffusion Models: A Perspective of
  Inductive and Primacy Biases'
openreview: v2o9rRJcEv
abstract: Bridging the gap between diffusion models and human preferences is crucial
  for their integration into practical generative workflows. While optimizing downstream
  reward models has emerged as a promising alignment strategy, concerns arise regarding
  the risk of excessive optimization with learned reward models, which potentially
  compromises ground-truth performance. In this work, we confront the reward overoptimization
  problem in diffusion model alignment through the lenses of both inductive and primacy
  biases. We first identify a mismatch between current methods and the temporal inductive
  bias inherent in the multi-step denoising process of diffusion models, as a potential
  source of reward overoptimization. Then, we surprisingly discover that dormant neurons
  in our critic model act as a regularization against reward overoptimization while
  active neurons reflect primacy bias. Motivated by these observations, we propose
  Temporal Diffusion Policy Optimization with critic active neuron Reset (TDPO-R),
  a policy gradient algorithm that exploits the temporal inductive bias of diffusion
  models and mitigates the primacy bias stemming from active neurons. Empirical results
  demonstrate the superior efficacy of our methods in mitigating reward overoptimization.
