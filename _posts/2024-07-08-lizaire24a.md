title: A Tensor Decomposition Perspective on Second-order RNNs
openreview: EsSSDjwFra
abstract: Second-order Recurrent Neural Networks (2RNNs) extend RNNs by leveraging
  second-order interactions for sequence modelling. These models are provably more
  expressive than their first-order counterparts and have connections to well-studied
  models from formal language theory. However, their large parameter tensor makes
  computations intractable. To circumvent this issue, one approach known as MIRNN
  consists in limiting the type of interactions used by the model. Another is to leverage
  tensor decomposition to diminish the parameter count. In this work, we study the
  model resulting from parameterizing 2RNNs using the CP decomposition, which we call
  CPRNN. Intuitively, the rank of the decomposition should reduce expressivity. We
  analyze how rank and hidden size affect model capacity and show the relationships
  between RNNs, 2RNNs, MIRNNs, and CPRNNs based on these parameters. We support these
  results empirically with experiments on the Penn Treebank dataset which demonstrate
  that, with a fixed parameter budget, CPRNNs outperforms RNNs, 2RNNs, and MIRNNs
  with the right choice of rank and hidden size.
