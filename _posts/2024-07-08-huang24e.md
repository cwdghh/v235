title: Near-Linear Time Approximation Algorithms for k-means with Outliers
openreview: EHjm3sXPFy
abstract: The k-means with outliers problem is one of the most extensively studied
  clustering problems in the field of machine learning, where the goal is to discard
  up to z outliers and identify a minimum k-means clustering on the remaining data
  points. Most previous results for this problem have running time dependent on the
  aspect ratio Δ (the ratio between the maximum and the minimum pairwise distances)
  to achieve fast approximations. To address the issue of aspect ratio dependency
  on the running time, we propose sampling-based algorithms with almost linear running
  time in the data size, where a crucial component of our approach is an algorithm
  called Fast-Sampling. Fast-Sampling algorithm can find inliers that well approximate
  the optimal clustering centers without relying on a guess for the optimal clustering
  costs, where a 4-approximate solution can be obtained in time $O(\frac{ndk\log\log
  n}{\epsilon^2})$ with O(k/ϵ) centers opened and (1+ϵ)z outliers discarded. To reduce
  the number of centers opened, we propose a center reduction algorithm, where an
  O(1/ϵ)-approximate solution can be obtained in time $O(\frac{ndk\log \log n}{\epsilon^2}
  + dpoly(k, \frac{1}{\epsilon})\log(n\Delta))$ with (1+ϵ)z outliers discarded and
  exactly k centers opened. Empirical experiments suggest that our proposed sampling-based
  algorithms outperform state-of-the-art algorithms for the k-means with outliers
  problem.
