title: Uncertainty-Aware Reward-Free Exploration with General Function Approximation
openreview: BvBdYSIkpb
abstract: Mastering multiple tasks through exploration and learning in an environment
  poses a significant challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Unsupervised RL has
  been introduced to address this challenge by training policies with intrinsic rewards
  rather than extrinsic rewards. However, current intrinsic reward designs and unsupervised
  RL algorithms often overlook the heterogeneous nature of collected samples, thereby
  diminishing their sample efficiency. To overcome this limitation, in this paper,
  we proposed a reward-free RL algorithm called GFA-RFE. The key idea behind our algorithm
  is an uncertainty-aware intrinsic reward for exploring the environment and an uncertainty-weighted
  learning process to handle heterogeneous uncertainty in different samples. Theoretically,
  we show that in order to find an $\epsilon$-optimal policy, GFA-RFE needs to collect
  $\tilde{O} (H^2 \log N_{\mathcal{F}} (\epsilon) \text{dim} (\mathcal{F}) / \epsilon^2
  )$ number of episodes, where $\mathcal{F}$ is the value function class with covering
  number $N_{\mathcal{F}} (\epsilon)$ and generalized eluder dimension $\text{dim}
  (\mathcal{F})$. Such a result outperforms all existing reward-free RL algorithms.
  We further implement and evaluate GFA-RFE across various domains and tasks in the
  DeepMind Control Suite. Experiment results show that GFA-RFE outperforms or is comparable
  to the performance of state-of-the-art unsupervised RL algorithms.
