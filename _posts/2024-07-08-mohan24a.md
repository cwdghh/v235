title: 'OAK: Enriching Document Representations using Auxiliary Knowledge for Extreme
  Classification'
openreview: Cbacx90Wkt
abstract: The objective in eXtreme Classification (XC) is to find relevant labels
  for a document from an exceptionally large label space. Most XC application scenarios
  have rich auxiliary data associated with the input documents, e.g., frequently clicked
  webpages for search queries in sponsored search. Unfortunately, most of the existing
  XC methods do not use any auxiliary data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
  Online Auxiliary Knowledge (OAK), which harnesses auxiliary information linked to
  the document to improve XC accuracy. OAK stores information learnt from the auxiliary
  data in a knowledge bank and during a forward pass, retrieves relevant auxiliary
  knowledge embeddings for a given document. An enriched embedding is obtained by
  fusing these auxiliary knowledge embeddings with the documentâ€™s embedding, thereby
  enabling much more precise candidate label selection and final classification. OAK
  training involves three stages. (1) Training a linker module to link documents to
  relevant auxiliary data points. (2) Learning an embedding for documents enriched
  using linked auxiliary information. (3) Using the enriched document embeddings to
  learn the final classifiers. OAK outperforms current state-of-the-art XC methods
  by up to $\sim 5 %$ on academic datasets, and by $\sim 3 %$ on an auxiliary data-augmented
  variant of LF-ORCAS-800K dataset in Precision@1. OAK also demonstrates statistically
  significant improvements in sponsored search metrics when deployed on a large scale
  search engine.
