title: Detecting Influence Structures in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
openreview: lm04PyXoEl
abstract: We consider the problem of quantifying the amount of influence one agent
  can exert on another in the setting of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).
  As a step towards a unified approach to express agents’ interdependencies, we introduce
  the total and state influence measurement functions. Both of these are valid for
  all common MARL systems, such as the discounted reward setting. Additionally, we
  propose novel quantities, called the total impact measurement (TIM) and state impact
  measurement (SIM), that characterize one agent’s influence on another by the maximum
  impact it can have on the other agents’ expected returns and represent instances
  of impact measurement functions in the average reward setting. Furthermore, we provide
  approximation algorithms for TIM and SIM with simultaneously learning approximations
  of agents’ expected returns, error bounds, stability analyses under changes of the
  policies, and convergence guarantees. The approximation algorithm relies only on
  observing other agents’ actions and is, other than that, fully decentralized. Through
  empirical studies, we validate our approach’s effectiveness in identifying intricate
  influence structures in complex interactions. Our work appears to be the first study
  of determining influence structures in the multi-agent average reward setting with
  convergence guarantees.
