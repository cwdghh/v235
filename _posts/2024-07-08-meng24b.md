  and Verification'
openreview: sZla6SnooP
abstract: Solving nonlinear optimal control problems is a challenging task, particularly
  for high-dimensional problems. We propose algorithms for model-based policy iterations
  to solve nonlinear optimal control problems with convergence guarantees. The main
  component of our approach is an iterative procedure that utilizes neural approximations
  to solve linear partial differential equations (PDEs), ensuring convergence. We
  present two variants of the algorithms. The first variant formulates the optimization
  problem as a linear least square problem, drawing inspiration from extreme learning
  machine (ELM) for solving PDEs. This variant efficiently handles low-dimensional
  problems with high accuracy. The second variant is based on a physics-informed neural
  network (PINN) for solving PDEs and has the potential to address high-dimensional
  problems. We demonstrate that both algorithms outperform traditional approaches,
  such as Galerkin methods, by a significant margin. We provide a theoretical analysis
  of both algorithms in terms of convergence of neural approximations towards the
  true optimal solutions in a general setting. Furthermore, we employ formal verification
  techniques to demonstrate the verifiable stability of the resulting controllers.
