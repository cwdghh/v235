title: Improving Diffusion Models for Inverse Problems Using Optimal Posterior Covariance
openreview: DrE7jVF4VW
abstract: Recent diffusion models provide a promising zero-shot solution to noisy
  linear inverse problems without retraining for specific inverse problems. In this
  paper, we reveal that recent methods can be uniformly interpreted as employing a
  Gaussian approximation with hand-crafted isotropic covariance for the intractable
  denoising posterior to approximate the conditional posterior mean. Inspired by this
  finding, we propose to improve recent methods by using more principled covariance
  determined by maximum likelihood estimation. To achieve posterior covariance optimization
  without retraining, we provide general plug-and-play solutions based on two approaches
  specifically designed for leveraging pre-trained models with and without reverse
  covariance. We further propose a scalable method for learning posterior covariance
  prediction based on representation with orthonormal basis. Experimental results
  demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly enhance reconstruction performance
  without requiring hyperparameter tuning.
