title: Time-Series Forecasting for Out-of-Distribution Generalization Using Invariant
  Learning
openreview: SMUXPVKUBg
abstract: Time-series forecasting (TSF) finds broad applications in real-world scenarios.
  Due to the dynamic nature of time-series data, it is crucial for TSF models to preserve
  out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization abilities, as training and test sets represent
  historical and future data respectively. In this paper, we aim to alleviate the
  inherent OOD problem in TSF via invariant learning. We identify fundamental challenges
  of invariant learning for TSF. First, the target variables in TSF may not be sufficiently
  determined by the input due to unobserved core variables in TSF, breaking the fundamental
  assumption of invariant learning. Second, time-series datasets lack adequate environment
  labels, while existing environmental inference methods are not suitable for TSF.
  To address these challenges, we propose FOIL, a model-agnostic framework that endows
  time-series forecasting for out-of-distribution generalization via invariant learning.
  Specifically, FOIL employs a novel surrogate loss to mitigate the impact of unobserved
  variables. Further, FOIL implements joint optimization by alternately inferring
  environments effectively with a multi-head network while preserving the temporal
  adjacency structure and learning invariant representations across inferred environments
  for OOD generalized TSF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed FOIL
  significantly and consistently improves the performance of various TSF models, achieving
  gains of up to 85%.
