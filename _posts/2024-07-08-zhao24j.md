title: 'Spider: A Unified Framework for Context-dependent Concept Segmentation'
openreview: mWV8NeU79e
abstract: Different from the context-independent (CI) concepts such as human, car,
  and airplane, context-dependent (CD) concepts require higher visual understanding
  ability, such as camouflaged object and medical lesion. Despite the rapid advance
  of many CD understanding tasks in respective branches, the isolated evolution leads
  to their limited cross-domain generalisation and repetitive technique innovation.
  Since there is a strong coupling relationship between foreground and background
  context in CD tasks, existing methods require to train separate models in their
  focused domains. This restricts their real-world CD concept understanding towards
  artificial general intelligence (AGI). We propose a unified model with a single
  set of parameters, Spider, which only needs to be trained once. With the help of
  the proposed concept filter driven by the image-mask group prompt, Spider is able
  to understand and distinguish diverse strong context-dependent concepts to accurately
  capture the Prompterâ€™s intention. Without bells and whistles, Spider significantly
  outperforms the state-of-the-art specialized models in 8 different context-dependent
  segmentation tasks, including 4 natural scenes (salient, camouflaged, and transparent
  objects and shadow) and 4 medical lesions (COVID-19, polyp, breast, and skin lesion
  with color colonoscopy, CT, ultrasound, and dermoscopy modalities). Besides, Spider
  shows obvious advantages in continuous learning. It can easily complete the training
  of new tasks by fine-tuning parameters less than 1% and bring a tolerable performance
  degradation of less than 5% for all old tasks. The source code will be publicly
  available at https://github.com/Xiaoqi-Zhao-DLUT/Spider-UniCDSeg.
