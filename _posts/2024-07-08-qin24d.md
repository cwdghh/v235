title: Feasible Reachable Policy Iteration
openreview: ks8qSwkkuZ
abstract: 'The goal-reaching tasks with safety constraints are common control problems
  in real world, such as intelligent driving and robot manipulation. The difficulty
  of this kind of problem comes from the exploration termination caused by safety
  constraints and the sparse rewards caused by goals. The existing safe RL avoids
  unsafe exploration by restricting the search space to a feasible region, the essence
  of which is the pruning of the search space. However, there are still many ineffective
  explorations in the feasible region because of the ignorance of the goals. Our approach
  considers both safety and goals; the policy space pruning is achieved by a function
  called feasible reachable function, which describes whether there is a policy to
  make the agent safely reach the goals in the finite time domain. This function naturally
  satisfies the self-consistent condition and the risky Bellman equation, which can
  be solved by the fixed point iteration method. On this basis, we propose feasible
  reachable policy iteration (FRPI), which is divided into three steps: policy evaluation,
  region expansion, and policy improvement. In the region expansion step, by using
  the information of agent to reach the goals, the convergence of the feasible region
  is accelerated, and simultaneously a smaller feasible reachable region is identified.
  The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed FR function in
  both improving the convergence speed of better or comparable performance without
  sacrificing safety and identifying a smaller policy space with higher sample efficiency.'
