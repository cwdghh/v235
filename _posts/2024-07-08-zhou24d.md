title: 'MD tree: a model-diagnostic tree grown on loss landscape'
openreview: teHPKqjX8q
abstract: 'This paper considers ”model diagnosis”, which we formulate as a classification
  problem. Given a pre-trained neural network (NN), the goal is to predict the source
  of failure from a set of failure modes (such as a wrong hyperparameter, inadequate
  model size, and insufficient data) without knowing the training configuration of
  the pre-trained NN. The conventional diagnosis approach uses training and validation
  errors to determine whether the model is underfitting or overfitting. However, we
  show that rich information about NN performance is encoded in the optimization loss
  landscape, which provides more actionable insights than validation-based measurements.
  Therefore, we propose a diagnosis method called MD tree based on loss landscape
  metrics and experimentally demonstrate its advantage over classical validation-based
  approaches. We verify the effectiveness of MD tree in multiple practical scenarios:
  (1) use several models trained on one dataset to diagnose a model trained on another
  dataset, essentially a few-shot dataset transfer problem; (2) use small models (or
  models trained with small data) to diagnose big models (or models trained with big
  data), essentially a scale transfer problem. In a dataset transfer task, MD tree
  achieves an accuracy of 87.7%, outperforming validation-based approaches by 14.88%.
