title: 'ATraDiff: Accelerating Online Reinforcement Learning with Imaginary Trajectories'
openreview: kIh7GJmRfD
abstract: Training autonomous agents with sparse rewards is a long-standing problem
  in online reinforcement learning (RL), due to low data efficiency. Prior work overcomes
  this challenge by extracting useful knowledge from offline data, often accomplished
  through the learning of action distribution from offline data and utilizing the
  learned distribution to facilitate online RL. However, since the offline data are
  given and fixed, the extracted knowledge is inherently limited, making it difficult
  to generalize to new tasks. We propose a novel approach that leverages offline data
  to learn a generative diffusion model, coined as Adaptive Trajectory Diffuser (ATraDiff).
  This model generates synthetic trajectories, serving as a form of data augmentation
  and consequently enhancing the performance of online RL methods. The key strength
  of our diffuser lies in its adaptability, allowing it to effectively handle varying
  trajectory lengths and mitigate distribution shifts between online and offline data.
  Because of its simplicity, ATraDiff seamlessly integrates with a wide spectrum of
  RL methods. Empirical evaluation shows that ATraDiff consistently achieves state-of-the-art
  performance across a variety of environments, with particularly pronounced improvements
  in complicated settings. Our code and demo video are available at https://atradiff.github.io.
