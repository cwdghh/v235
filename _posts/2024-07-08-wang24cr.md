title: 'Boximator: Generating Rich and Controllable Motions for Video Synthesis'
openreview: 7wgXuNOF0V
abstract: 'Generating rich and controllable motion is a pivotal challenge in video
  synthesis. We propose <em>Boximator</em>, a new approach for fine-grained motion
  control. Boximator introduces two constraint types: <em>hard box</em> and <em>soft
  box</em>. Users select objects in the conditional frame using hard boxes and then
  use either type of boxes to roughly or rigorously define the object’s position,
  shape, or motion path in future frames. Boximator functions as a plug-in for existing
  video diffusion models. Its training process preserves the base model’s knowledge
  by freezing the original weights and training only the control module. To address
  training challenges, we introduce a novel <em>self-tracking</em> technique that
  greatly simplifies the learning of box-object correlations. Empirically, Boximator
  achieves state-of-the-art video quality (FVD) scores, improving on two base models,
  and further enhanced after incorporating box constraints. Its robust motion controllability
  is validated by drastic increases in the bounding box alignment metric. Human evaluation
  also shows that users favor Boximator generation results over the base model.'
