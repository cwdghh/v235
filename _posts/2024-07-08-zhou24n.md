title: 'RAUCA: A Novel Physical Adversarial Attack on Vehicle Detectors via Robust
  and Accurate Camouflage Generation'
openreview: pBTLGM9uWx
abstract: Adversarial camouflage is a widely used physical attack against vehicle
  detectors for its superiority in multi-view attack performance. One promising approach
  involves using differentiable neural renderers to facilitate adversarial camouflage
  optimization through gradient back-propagation. However, existing methods often
  struggle to capture environmental characteristics during the rendering process or
  produce adversarial textures that can precisely map to the target vehicle, resulting
  in suboptimal attack performance. Moreover, these approaches neglect diverse weather
  conditions, reducing the efficacy of generated camouflage across varying weather
  scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we propose a robust and accurate camouflage
  generation method, namely RAUCA. The core of RAUCA is a novel neural rendering component,
  Neural Renderer Plus (NRP), which can accurately project vehicle textures and render
  images with environmental characteristics such as lighting and weather. In addition,
  we integrate a multi-weather dataset for camouflage generation, leveraging the NRP
  to enhance the attack robustness. Experimental results on six popular object detectors
  show that RAUCA consistently outperforms existing methods in both simulation and
  real-world settings.
