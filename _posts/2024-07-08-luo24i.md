title: Cluster-Aware Similarity Diffusion for Instance Retrieval
openreview: qMG3OK7Xcg
abstract: Diffusion-based re-ranking is a common method used for retrieving instances
  by performing similarity propagation in a nearest neighbor graph. However, existing
  techniques that construct the affinity graph based on pairwise instances can lead
  to the propagation of misinformation from outliers and other manifolds, resulting
  in inaccurate results. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel Cluster-Aware
  Similarity (CAS) diffusion for instance retrieval. The primary concept of CAS is
  to conduct similarity diffusion within local clusters, which can reduce the influence
  from other manifolds explicitly. To obtain a symmetrical and smooth similarity matrix,
  our Bidirectional Similarity Diffusion strategy introduces an inverse constraint
  term to the optimization objective of local cluster diffusion. Additionally, we
  have optimized a Neighbor-guided Similarity Smoothing approach to ensure similarity
  consistency among the local neighbors of each instance. Evaluations in instance
  retrieval and object re-identification validate the effectiveness of the proposed
  CAS, our code is publicly available.
