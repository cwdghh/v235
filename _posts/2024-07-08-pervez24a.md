title: Mechanistic Neural Networks for Scientific Machine Learning
openreview: pLtuwhoQh7
abstract: This paper presents <em>Mechanistic Neural Networks</em>, a neural network
  design for machine learning applications in the sciences. It incorporates a new
  <em>Mechanistic Block</em> in standard architectures to explicitly learn governing
  differential equations as representations, revealing the underlying dynamics of
  data and enhancing interpretability and efficiency in data modeling. Central to
  our approach is a novel <em>Relaxed Linear Programming Solver</em> (NeuRLP) inspired
  by a technique that reduces solving linear ODEs to solving linear programs. This
  integrates well with neural networks and surpasses the limitations of traditional
  ODE solvers enabling scalable GPU parallel processing. Overall, Mechanistic Neural
  Networks demonstrate their versatility for scientific machine learning applications,
  adeptly managing tasks from equation discovery to dynamic systems modeling. We prove
  their comprehensive capabilities in analyzing and interpreting complex scientific
  data across various applications, showing significant performance against specialized
  state-of-the-art methods. Source code is available at https://github.com/alpz/mech-nn.
