title: Convergence of Online Learning Algorithm for a Mixture of Multiple Linear Regressions
openreview: ULKvSqmSgA
abstract: This paper considers the parameter learning and data clustering problem
  for MLR with multiple sub-models and arbitrary mixing weights. To deal with the
  data streaming case, we propose an online learning algorithm to estimate the unknown
  parameters. By utilizing Ljungâ€™s ODE method, we establish the almost sure convergence
  results of this MLR problem without the traditional i.i.d. assumption on the input
  data for the first time. Based on the convergence property and using the classical
  stochastic Lyapunov function method, we also obtain the convergence rate analysis
  of the proposed algorithm for the first time. In addition, the data clustering can
  asymptotically achieve the same performance as the case with known parameters. Future
  work will consider how to relax the asymptotically stationary and ergodic assumption
  on the input data, and how to design algorithms with global convergence performance
  for the MLR problem.
