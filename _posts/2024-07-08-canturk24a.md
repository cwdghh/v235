title: Graph Positional and Structural Encoder
openreview: UTSCK582Yo
abstract: 'Positional and structural encodings (PSE) enable better identifiability
  of nodes within a graph, rendering them essential tools for empowering modern GNNs,
  and in particular graph Transformers. However, designing PSEs that work optimally
  for all graph prediction tasks is a challenging and unsolved problem. Here, we present
  the Graph Positional and Structural Encoder (GPSE), the first-ever graph encoder
  designed to capture rich PSE representations for augmenting any GNN. GPSE learns
  an efficient common latent representation for multiple PSEs, and is highly transferable:
  The encoder trained on a particular graph dataset can be used effectively on datasets
  drawn from markedly different distributions and modalities. We show that across
  a wide range of benchmarks, GPSE-enhanced models can significantly outperform those
  that employ explicitly computed PSEs, and at least match their performance in others.
  Our results pave the way for the development of foundational pre-trained graph encoders
  for extracting positional and structural information, and highlight their potential
  as a more powerful and efficient alternative to explicitly computed PSEs and existing
  self-supervised pre-training approaches. Our framework and pre-trained models are
  publicly available at https://github.com/G-Taxonomy-Workgroup/GPSE. For convenience,
  GPSE has also been integrated into the PyG library to facilitate downstream applications.'
