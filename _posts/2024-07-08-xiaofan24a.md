title: Intersecting-Boundary-Sensitive Fingerprinting for Tampering Detection of DNN
  Models
openreview: kZArjKc64o
abstract: Cloud-based AI services offer numerous benefits but also introduce vulnerabilities,
  allowing for tampering with deployed DNN models, ranging from injecting malicious
  behaviors to reducing computing resources. Fingerprint samples are generated to
  query models to detect such tampering. In this paper, we present Intersecting-Boundary-Sensitive
  Fingerprinting (IBSF), a novel method for black-box integrity verification of DNN
  models using only top-1 labels. Recognizing that tampering with a model alters its
  decision boundary, IBSF crafts fingerprint samples from normal samples by maximizing
  the partial Shannon entropy of a selected subset of categories to position the fingerprint
  samples near decision boundaries where the categories in the subset intersect. These
  fingerprint samples are almost indistinguishable from their source samples. We theoretically
  establish and confirm experimentally that these fingerprint samplesâ€™ expected sensitivity
  to tampering increases with the cardinality of the subset. Extensive evaluation
  demonstrates that IBSF surpasses existing state-of-the-art fingerprinting methods,
  particularly with larger subset cardinality, establishing its state-of-the-art performance
  in black-box tampering detection using only top-1 labels. The IBSF code is available
  at https://github.com/CGCL-codes/IBSF.
