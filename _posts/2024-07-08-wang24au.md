title: A Dual-module Framework for Counterfactual Estimation over Time
openreview: 126SR50BEL
abstract: Efficiently and effectively estimating counterfactuals over time is crucial
  for optimizing treatment strategies. We present the Adversarial Counterfactual Temporal
  Inference Network (ACTIN), a novel framework with dual modules to enhance counterfactual
  estimation. The balancing module employs a distribution-based adversarial method
  to learn balanced representations, extending beyond the limitations of current classification-based
  methods to mitigate confounding bias across various treatment types. The integrating
  module adopts a novel Temporal Integration Predicting (TIP) strategy, which has
  a wider receptive field of treatments and balanced representations from the beginning
  to the current time for a more profound level of analysis. TIP goes beyond the established
  Direct Predicting (DP) strategy, which only relies on current treatments and representations,
  by empowering the integrating module to effectively capture long-range dependencies
  and temporal treatment interactions. ACTIN exceeds the confines of specific base
  models, and when implemented with simple base models, consistently delivers state-of-the-art
  performance and efficiency across both synthetic and real-world datasets.
