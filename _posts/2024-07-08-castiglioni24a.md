title: Online Learning under Budget and ROI Constraints via Weak Adaptivity
openreview: shzEkKPrsn
abstract: We study online learning problems in which a decision maker has to make
  a sequence of costly decisions, with the goal of maximizing their expected reward
  while adhering to budget and return-on-investment (ROI) constraints. Existing primal-dual
  algorithms designed for constrained online learning problems under adversarial inputs
  rely on two fundamental assumptions. First, the decision maker must know beforehand
  the value of parameters related to the degree of strict feasibility of the problem
  (i.e. Slater parameters). Second, a strictly feasible solution to the offline optimization
  problem must exist at each round. Both requirements are unrealistic for practical
  applications such as bidding in online ad auctions. In this paper, we show how such
  assumptions can be circumvented by endowing standard primal-dual templates with
  <em>weakly adaptive</em> regret minimizers. This results in a “dual-balancing” framework
  which ensures that dual variables stay sufficiently small, even in the absence of
  knowledge about Slater’s parameter. We prove the first <em>best-of-both-worlds</em>
  no-regret guarantees which hold in absence of the two aforementioned assumptions,
  under stochastic and adversarial inputs. Finally, we show how to instantiate the
  framework to optimally bid in various mechanisms of practical relevance, such as
  first- and second-price auctions.
