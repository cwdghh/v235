title: Value-Evolutionary-Based Reinforcement Learning
openreview: XobPpcN4yZ
abstract: Combining Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL)
  for policy search has been proven to improve RL performance. However, previous works
  largely overlook value-based RL in favor of merging EAs with policy-based RL. This
  paper introduces Value-Evolutionary-Based Reinforcement Learning (VEB-RL) that focuses
  on the integration of EAs with value-based RL. The framework maintains a population
  of value functions instead of policies and leverages negative Temporal Difference
  error as the fitness metric for evolution. The metric is more sample-efficient for
  population evaluation than cumulative rewards and is closely associated with the
  accuracy of the value function approximation. Additionally, VEB-RL enables elites
  of the population to interact with the environment to offer high-quality samples
  for RL optimization, whereas the RL value function participates in the populationâ€™s
  evolution in each generation. Experiments on MinAtar and Atari demonstrate the superiority
  of VEB-RL in significantly improving DQN, Rainbow, and SPR. Our code is available
  on https://github.com/yeshenpy/VEB-RL.
