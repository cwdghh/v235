title: On the Universality of Volume-Preserving and Coupling-Based Normalizing Flows
openreview: uA3FRvO2DJ
abstract: We present a novel theoretical framework for understanding the expressive
  power of normalizing flows. Despite their prevalence in scientific applications,
  a comprehensive understanding of flows remains elusive due to their restricted architectures.
  Existing theorems fall short as they require the use of arbitrarily ill-conditioned
  neural networks, limiting practical applicability. We propose a distributional universality
  theorem for well-conditioned coupling-based normalizing flows such as RealNVP. In
  addition, we show that volume-preserving normalizing flows are not universal, what
  distribution they learn instead, and how to fix their expressivity. Our results
  support the general wisdom that affine and related couplings are expressive and
  in general outperform volume-preserving flows, bridging a gap between empirical
  results and theoretical understanding.
