title: 'Position: Evolving AI Collectives Enhance Human Diversity and Enable Self-Regulation'
openreview: u6PeRHEsjL
abstract: Large language model behavior is shaped by the language of those with whom
  they interact. This capacity and their increasing prevalence online portend that
  they will intentionally or unintentionally "program" one another and form emergent
  AI subjectivities, relationships, and collectives. Here, we call upon the research
  community to investigate these "societies" of interacting artificial intelligences
  to increase their rewards and reduce their risks for human society and the health
  of online environments. We use a small "community" of models and their evolving
  outputs to illustrate how such emergent, decentralized AI collectives can spontaneously
  expand the bounds of human diversity and reduce the risk of toxic, anti-social behavior
  online. Finally, we discuss opportunities for AI cross-moderation and address ethical
  issues and design challenges associated with creating and maintaining free-formed
  AI collectives.
