title: 'A Sober Look at LLMs for Material Discovery: Are They Actually Good for Bayesian
  Optimization Over Molecules?'
openreview: Pa3GyTe3kf
abstract: Automation is one of the cornerstones of contemporary material discovery.
  Bayesian optimization (BO) is an essential part of such workflows, enabling scientists
  to leverage prior domain knowledge into efficient exploration of a large molecular
  space. While such prior knowledge can take many forms, there has been significant
  fanfare around the ancillary scientific knowledge encapsulated in large language
  models (LLMs). However, existing work thus far has only explored LLMs for heuristic
  materials searches. Indeed, recent work obtains the uncertainty estimate—an integral
  part of BO—from point-estimated, <em>non-Bayesian</em> LLMs. In this work, we study
  the question of whether LLMs are actually useful to accelerate principled <em>Bayesian</em>
  optimization in the molecular space. We take a sober, dispassionate stance in answering
  this question. This is done by carefully (i) viewing LLMs as fixed feature extractors
  for standard but principled BO surrogate models and by (ii) leveraging parameter-efficient
  finetuning methods and Bayesian neural networks to obtain the posterior of the LLM
  surrogate. Our extensive experiments with real-world chemistry problems show that
  LLMs can be useful for BO over molecules, but only if they have been pretrained
  or finetuned with domain-specific data.
