title: Understanding Retrieval-Augmented Task Adaptation for Vision-Language Models
openreview: RIMRKeeVsr
abstract: Pre-trained contrastive vision-language models have demonstrated remarkable
  performance across a wide range of tasks. However, they often struggle on fine-trained
  datasets with categories not adequately represented during pre-training, which makes
  adaptation necessary. Recent works have shown promising results by utilizing samples
  from web-scale databases for retrieval-augmented adaptation, especially in low-data
  regimes. Despite the empirical success, understanding how retrieval impacts the
  adaptation of vision-language models remains an open research question. In this
  work, we adopt a reflective perspective by presenting a systematic study to understand
  the roles of key components in retrieval-augmented adaptation. We unveil new insights
  on uni-modal and cross-modal retrieval and highlight the critical role of logit
  ensemble for effective adaptation. We further present theoretical underpinnings
  that directly support our empirical observations.
