title: 'DS-Agent: Automated Data Science by Empowering Large Language Models with
  Case-Based Reasoning'
openreview: LfJgeBNCFI
abstract: In this work, we investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs)
  based agents to automate data science tasks, with the goal of comprehending task
  requirements, then building and training the best-fit machine learning models. Despite
  their widespread success, existing LLM agents are hindered by generating unreasonable
  experiment plans within this scenario. To this end, we present DS-Agent, a novel
  automatic framework that harnesses LLM agent and case-based reasoning (CBR). In
  the development stage, DS-Agent follows the CBR framework to structure an automatic
  iteration pipeline, which can flexibly capitalize on the expert knowledge from Kaggle,
  and facilitate consistent performance improvement through the feedback mechanism.
  Moreover, DS-Agent implements a low-resource deployment stage with a simplified
  CBR paradigm to adapt past successful solutions from the development stage for direct
  code generation, significantly reducing the demand on foundational capabilities
  of LLMs. Empirically, DS-Agent with GPT-4 achieves 100% success rate in the development
  stage, while attaining 36% improvement on average one pass rate across alternative
  LLMs in the deployment stage. In both stages, DS-Agent achieves the best rank in
  performance, costing $1.60 and \$0.13 per run with GPT-4, respectively. Our data
  and code are open-sourced at https://github.com/guosyjlu/DS-Agent.
