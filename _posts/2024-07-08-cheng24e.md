title: 'BadPart: Unified Black-box Adversarial Patch Attacks against Pixel-wise Regression
  Tasks'
openreview: uGoi3nY62g
abstract: Pixel-wise regression tasks (e.g., monocular depth estimation (MDE) and
  optical flow estimation (OFE)) have been widely involved in our daily life in applications
  like autonomous driving, augmented reality and video composition. Although certain
  applications are security-critical or bear societal significance, the adversarial
  robustness of such models are not sufficiently studied, especially in the black-box
  scenario. In this work, we introduce the first unified black-box adversarial patch
  attack framework against pixel-wise regression tasks, aiming to identify the vulnerabilities
  of these models under query-based black-box attacks. We propose a novel square-based
  adversarial patch optimization framework and employ probabilistic square sampling
  and score-based gradient estimation techniques to generate the patch effectively
  and efficiently, overcoming the scalability problem of previous black-box patch
  attacks. Our attack prototype, named BadPart, is evaluated on both MDE and OFE tasks,
  utilizing a total of 7 models. BadPart surpasses 3 baseline methods in terms of
  both attack performance and efficiency. We also apply BadPart on the Google online
  service for portrait depth estimation, causing 43.5% relative distance error with
  50K queries. State-of-the-art (SOTA) countermeasures cannot defend our attack effectively.
