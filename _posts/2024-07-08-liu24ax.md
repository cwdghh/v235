title: Fast Decision Boundary based Out-of-Distribution Detector
openreview: eQaOb4r6YC
abstract: 'Efficient and effective Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is essential
  for the safe deployment of AI systems. Existing feature space methods, while effective,
  often incur significant computational overhead due to their reliance on auxiliary
  models built from training features. In this paper, we propose a computationally-efficient
  OOD detector without using auxiliary models while still leveraging the rich information
  embedded in the feature space. Specifically, we detect OOD samples based on their
  feature distances to decision boundaries. To minimize computational cost, we introduce
  an efficient closed-form estimation, analytically proven to tightly lower bound
  the distance. Based on our estimation, we discover that In-Distribution (ID) features
  tend to be further from decision boundaries than OOD features. Additionally, ID
  and OOD samples are better separated when compared at equal deviation levels from
  the mean of training features. By regularizing the distances to decision boundaries
  based on feature deviation from the mean, we develop a hyperparameter-free, auxiliary
  model-free OOD detector. Our method matches or surpasses the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
  methods in extensive experiments while incurring negligible overhead in inference
  latency. Overall, our approach significantly improves the efficiency-effectiveness
  trade-off in OOD detection. Code is available at: https://github.com/litianliu/fDBD-OOD.'
