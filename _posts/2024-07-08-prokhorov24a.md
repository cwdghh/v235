title: Autoencoding Conditional Neural Processes for Representation Learning
openreview: XuQPA4D396
abstract: 'Conditional neural processes (CNPs) are a flexible and efficient family
  of models that learn to learn a stochastic process from data. They have seen particular
  application in contextual image completion - observing pixel values at some locations
  to predict a distribution over values at other unobserved locations. However, the
  choice of pixels in learning CNPs is typically either random or derived from a simple
  statistical measure (e.g. pixel variance). Here, we turn the problem on its head
  and ask: which pixels would a CNP like to observe - do they facilitate fitting better
  CNPs, and do such pixels tell us something meaningful about the underlying image?
  To this end we develop the Partial Pixel Space Variational Autoencoder (PPS-VAE),
  an amortised variational framework that casts CNP context as latent variables learnt
  simultaneously with the CNP. We evaluate PPS-VAE over a number of tasks across different
  visual data, and find that not only can it facilitate better-fit CNPs, but also
  that the spatial arrangement and values meaningfully characterise image information
  - evaluated through the lens of classification on both within and out-of-data distributions.
  Our model additionally allows for dynamic adaption of context-set size and the ability
  to scale-up to larger images, providing a promising avenue to explore learning meaningful
  and effective visual representations.'
