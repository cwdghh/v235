title: Can a Few Decide for Many? The Metric Distortion of Sortition
openreview: nsjfoziR5j
abstract: 'Recent works have studied the design of algorithms for selecting representative
  sortition panels. However, the most central question remains unaddressed: Do these
  panels reflect the entire population’s opinion? We present a positive answer by
  adopting the concept of metric distortion from computational social choice, which
  aims to quantify how much a panel’s decision aligns with the ideal decision of the
  population when preferences and agents lie on a metric space. We show that uniform
  selection needs only logarithmically many agents in terms of the number of alternatives
  to achieve almost optimal distortion. We also show that Fair Greedy Capture, a selection
  algorithm introduced recently by Ebadian and Micha (2024), matches uniform selection’s
  guarantees of almost optimal distortion and also achieves constant ex-post distortion,
  ensuring a “best of both worlds” performance.'
