title: Discrete Latent Perspective Learning for Segmentation and Detection
openreview: VWCpm39peL
abstract: 'In this paper, we address the challenge of Perspective-Invariant Learning
  in machine learning and computer vision, which involves enabling a network to understand
  images from varying perspectives to achieve consistent semantic interpretation.
  While standard approaches rely on the labor-intensive collection of multi-view images
  or limited data augmentation techniques, we propose a novel framework, Discrete
  Latent Perspective Learning (DLPL), for latent multi-perspective fusion learning
  using conventional single-view images. DLPL comprises three main modules: Perspective
  Discrete Decomposition (PDD), Perspective Homography Transformation (PHT), and Perspective
  Invariant Attention (PIA), which work together to discretize visual features, transform
  perspectives, and fuse multi-perspective semantic information, respectively. DLPL
  is a universal perspective learning framework applicable to a variety of scenarios
  and vision tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DLPL significantly enhances
  the networkâ€™s capacity to depict images across diverse scenarios (daily photos,
  UAV, auto-driving) and tasks (detection, segmentation).'
