title: "$f$-Divergence Based Classification: Beyond the Use of Cross-Entropy"
openreview: RFhkcqRmTD
abstract: 'In deep learning, classification tasks are formalized as optimization problems
  often solved via the minimization of the cross-entropy. However, recent advancements
  in the design of objective functions allow the usage of the $f$-divergence to generalize
  the formulation of the optimization problem for classification. We adopt a Bayesian
  perspective and formulate the classification task as a maximum a posteriori probability
  problem. We propose a class of objective functions based on the variational representation
  of the $f$-divergence. Furthermore, driven by the challenge of improving the state-of-the-art
  approach, we propose a bottom-up method that leads us to the formulation of an objective
  function corresponding to a novel $f$-divergence referred to as shifted log (SL).
  We theoretically analyze the objective functions proposed and numerically test them
  in three application scenarios: toy examples, image datasets, and signal detection/decoding
  problems. The analyzed scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
  and that the SL divergence achieves the highest classification accuracy in almost
  all the considered cases.'
