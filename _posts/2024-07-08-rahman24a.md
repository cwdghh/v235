title: Modular Learning of Deep Causal Generative Models for High-dimensional Causal
  Inference
openreview: bOhzU7NpTB
abstract: Sound and complete algorithms have been proposed to compute identifiable
  causal queries using the causal structure and data. However, most of these algorithms
  assume accurate estimation of the data distribution, which is impractical for high-dimensional
  variables such as images. On the other hand, modern deep generative architectures
  can be trained to sample from high-dimensional distributions. However, training
  these networks are typically very costly. Thus, it is desirable to leverage pre-trained
  models to answer causal queries using such high-dimensional data. To address this,
  we propose modular training of deep causal generative models that not only makes
  learning more efficient, but also allows us to utilize large, pre-trained conditional
  generative models. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm, Modular-DCM is the
  first algorithm that, given the causal structure, uses adversarial training to learn
  the network weights, and can make use of pre-trained models to provably sample from
  any identifiable causal query in the presence of latent confounders. With extensive
  experiments on the Colored-MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms
  the baselines. We also show our algorithmâ€™s convergence on the COVIDx dataset and
  its utility with a causal invariant prediction problem on CelebA-HQ.
