title: Exploring the Enigma of Neural Dynamics Through A Scattering-Transform Mixer
  Landscape for Riemannian Manifold
openreview: EYOo48YGhy
abstract: The human brain is a complex inter-wired system that emerges spontaneous
  functional fluctuations. In spite of tremendous success in the experimental neuroscience
  field, a system-level understanding of how brain anatomy supports various neural
  activities remains elusive. Capitalizing on the unprecedented amount of neuroimaging
  data, we present a physics-informed deep model to uncover the coupling mechanism
  between brain structure and function through the lens of data geometry that is rooted
  in the widespread wiring topology of connections between distant brain regions.
  Since deciphering the puzzle of self-organized patterns in functional fluctuations
  is the gateway to understanding the emergence of cognition and behavior, we devise
  a geometric deep model to uncover manifold mapping functions that characterize the
  intrinsic feature representations of evolving functional fluctuations on the Riemannian
  manifold. In lieu of learning unconstrained mapping functions, we introduce a set
  of graph-harmonic scattering transforms to impose the brain-wide geometry on top
  of manifold mapping functions, which allows us to cast the manifold-based deep learning
  into a reminiscent of <em>MLP-Mixer</em> architecture (in computer vision) for Riemannian
  manifold. As a proof-of-concept approach, we explore a neural-manifold perspective
  to understand the relationship between (static) brain structure and (dynamic) function,
  challenging the prevailing notion in cognitive neuroscience by proposing that neural
  activities are essentially excited by brain-wide oscillation waves living on the
  geometry of human connectomes, instead of being confined to focal areas.
