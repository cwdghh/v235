title: 'Position: Open-Endedness is Essential for Artificial Superhuman Intelligence'
openreview: Bc4vZ2CX7E
abstract: In recent years there has been a tremendous surge in the general capabilities
  of AI systems, mainly fuelled by training foundation models on internet-scale data.
  Nevertheless, the creation of open-ended, ever self-improving AI remains elusive.
  <b>In this position paper, we argue that the ingredients are now in place to achieve
  <em>open-endedness</em> in AI systems with respect to a human observer. Furthermore,
  we claim that such open-endedness is an essential property of any artificial superhuman
  intelligence (ASI).</b> We begin by providing a concrete formal definition of open-endedness
  through the lens of novelty and learnability. We then illustrate a path towards
  ASI via open-ended systems built on top of foundation models, capable of making
  novel, human-relevant discoveries. We conclude by examining the safety implications
  of generally-capable open-ended AI. We expect that open-ended foundation models
  will prove to be an increasingly fertile and safety-critical area of research in
  the near future.
