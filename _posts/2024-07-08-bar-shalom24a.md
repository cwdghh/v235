title: 'Subgraphormer: Unifying Subgraph GNNs and Graph Transformers via Graph Products'
openreview: 6djDWVTUEq
abstract: 'In the realm of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), two exciting research directions
  have recently emerged: Subgraph GNNs and Graph Transformers. In this paper, we propose
  an architecture that integrates both approaches, dubbed <em>Subgraphormer</em>,
  which combines the enhanced expressive power, message-passing mechanisms, and aggregation
  schemes from Subgraph GNNs with attention and positional encodings, arguably the
  most important components in Graph Transformers. Our method is based on an intriguing
  new connection we reveal between Subgraph GNNs and product graphs, suggesting that
  Subgraph GNNs can be formulated as Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) operating
  on a product of the graph with itself. We use this formulation to design our architecture:
  first, we devise an attention mechanism based on the connectivity of the product
  graph. Following this, we propose a novel and efficient positional encoding scheme
  for Subgraph GNNs, which we derive as a positional encoding for the product graph.
  Our experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements over both
  Subgraph GNNs and Graph Transformers on a wide range of datasets.'
