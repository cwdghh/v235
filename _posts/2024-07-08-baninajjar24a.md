title: 'VNN: Verification-Friendly Neural Networks with Hard Robustness Guarantees'
openreview: gUFufRkzjV
abstract: Machine learning techniques often lack formal correctness guarantees, evidenced
  by the widespread adversarial examples that plague most deep-learning applications.
  This lack of formal guarantees resulted in several research efforts that aim at
  verifying Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), with a particular focus on safety-critical
  applications. However, formal verification techniques still face major scalability
  and precision challenges. The over-approximation introduced during the formal verification
  process to tackle the scalability challenge often results in inconclusive analysis.
  To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework to generate Verification-Friendly
  Neural Networks (VNNs). We present a post-training optimization framework to achieve
  a balance between preserving prediction performance and verification-friendliness.
  Our proposed framework results in VNNs that are comparable to the original DNNs
  in terms of prediction performance, while amenable to formal verification techniques.
  This essentially enables us to establish robustness for more VNNs than their DNN
  counterparts, in a time-efficient manner.
