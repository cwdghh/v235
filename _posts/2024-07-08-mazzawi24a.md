title: 'Deep Fusion: Efficient Network Training via Pre-trained Initializations'
openreview: 4PuM6iGPPi
abstract: Training deep neural networks for large language models (LLMs) remains computationally
  very expensive. To mitigate this, network growing algorithms offer potential cost
  savings, but their underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this paper, we
  propose a theoretical framework using backward error analysis to illuminate the
  dynamics of mid-training network growth. Furthermore, we introduce Deep Fusion,
  an efficient network training approach that leverages pre-trained initializations
  of smaller networks, facilitating network growth from diverse sources. Our experiments
  validate the power of our theoretical framework in guiding the optimal use of Deep
  Fusion. With carefully optimized training dynamics, Deep Fusion demonstrates significant
  reductions in both training time and resource consumption. Importantly, these gains
  are achieved without sacrificing performance. We demonstrate reduced computational
  requirements, and improved generalization performance on a variety of NLP tasks
  and T5 model sizes.
