title: Bridging Data Gaps in Diffusion Models with Adversarial Noise-Based Transfer
  Learning
openreview: PpBs2iL0jv
abstract: 'Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) show significant potential in image
  generation, yet their performance hinges on having access to large datasets. Previous
  works, like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have tackled the limited data
  problem by transferring pre-trained models learned with sufficient data. However,
  those methods are hard to be utilized in DPMs since the distinct differences between
  DPM-based and GAN-based methods, showing in the unique iterative denoising process
  integral and the need for many timesteps with no-targeted noise in DPMs. In this
  paper, we propose a novel DPMs-based transfer learning method, ANT, to address the
  limited data problem. It includes two strategies: similarity-guided training, which
  boosts transfer with a classifier, and adversarial noise selection which adaptively
  chooses targeted noise based on the input image. Extensive experiments in the context
  of few-shot image generation tasks demonstrate that our method is not only efficient
  but also excels in terms of image quality and diversity when compared to existing
  GAN-based and DDPM-based methods.'
