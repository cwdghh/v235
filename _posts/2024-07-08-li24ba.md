title: Improving Prototypical Visual Explanations with Reward Reweighing, Reselection,
  and Retraining
openreview: MlzUD5CKvZ
abstract: In recent years, work has gone into developing deep interpretable methods
  for image classification that clearly attributes a modelâ€™s output to specific features
  of the data. One such of these methods is the Prototypical Part Network (ProtoPNet),
  which attempts to classify images based on meaningful parts of the input. While
  this architecture is able to produce visually interpretable classifications, it
  often learns to classify based on parts of the image that are not semantically meaningful.
  To address this problem, we propose the Reward Reweighing, Reselecting, and Retraining
  (R3) post-processing framework, which performs three additional corrective updates
  to a pretrained ProtoPNet in an offline and efficient manner. The first two steps
  involve learning a reward model based on collected human feedback and then aligning
  the prototypes with human preferences. The final step is retraining, which realigns
  the base features and the classifier layer of the original model with the updated
  prototypes. We find that our R3 framework consistently improves both the interpretability
  and the predictive accuracy of ProtoPNet and its variants.
