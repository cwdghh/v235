title: 'GeoReasoner: Geo-localization with Reasoning in Street Views using a Large
  Vision-Language Model'
openreview: WWo9G5zyh0
abstract: This work tackles the problem of geo-localization with a new paradigm using
  a large vision-language model (LVLM) augmented with human inference knowledge. A
  primary challenge here is the scarcity of data for training the LVLM - existing
  street-view datasets often contain numerous low-quality images lacking visual clues,
  and lack any reasoning inference. To address the data-quality issue, we devise a
  CLIP-based network to quantify the degree of street-view images being locatable,
  leading to the creation of a new dataset comprising highly locatable street views.
  To enhance reasoning inference, we integrate external knowledge obtained from real
  geo-localization games, tapping into valuable human inference capabilities. The
  data are utilized to train GeoReasoner, which undergoes fine-tuning through dedicated
  reasoning and location-tuning stages. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations illustrate
  that GeoReasoner outperforms counterpart LVLMs by more than 25% at country-level
  and 38% at city-level geo-localization tasks, and surpasses StreetCLIP performance
  while requiring fewer training resources. The data and code are available at https://github.com/lingli1996/GeoReasoner.
