title: 'InstructSpeech: Following Speech Editing Instructions via Large Language Models'
openreview: xlWcdtCyOC
abstract: Instruction-guided speech editing aims to follow the user’s natural language
  instruction to manipulate the semantic and acoustic attributes of a speech. In this
  work, we construct triplet paired data (instruction, input speech, output speech)
  to alleviate data scarcity and train a multi-task large language model named InstructSpeech.
  To mitigate the challenges of accurately executing user’s instructions, we 1) introduce
  the learned task embeddings with a fine-tuned Flan-T5-XL to guide the generation
  process towards the correct generative task; 2) include an extensive and diverse
  set of speech editing and processing tasks to enhance model capabilities; 3) investigate
  chain-of-thought reasoning for free-form semantic content editing; and 4) propose
  a hierarchical adapter that effectively updates a small portion of parameters for
  generalization to new tasks. To assess instruction speech editing in greater depth,
  we introduce a benchmark evaluation with contrastive instruction-speech pre-training
  (CISP) to test the speech quality and instruction-speech alignment faithfulness.
  Experimental results demonstrate that InstructSpeech achieves state-of-the-art results
  in eleven tasks, for the first time unlocking the ability to edit speech’s acoustic
  and semantic attributes following a user’s instruction. Audio samples are available
