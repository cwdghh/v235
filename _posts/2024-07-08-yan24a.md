title: Balancing Similarity and Complementarity for Federated Learning
openreview: v6tAdeCXKH
abstract: 'In mobile and IoT systems, Federated Learning (FL) is increasingly important
  for effectively using data while maintaining user privacy. One key challenge in
  FL is managing statistical heterogeneity, such as non-i.i.d. data, arising from
  numerous clients and diverse data sources. This requires strategic cooperation,
  often with clients having similar characteristics. However, we are interested in
  a fundamental question: does achieving optimal cooperation necessarily entail cooperating
  with the most similar clients? Typically, significant model performance improvements
  are often realized not by partnering with the most similar models, but through leveraging
  complementary data. Our theoretical and empirical analyses suggest that optimal
  cooperation is achieved by enhancing complementarity in feature distribution while
  restricting the disparity in the correlation between features and targets. Accordingly,
  we introduce a novel framework, FedSaC, which balances similarity and complementarity
  in FL cooperation. Our framework aims to approximate an optimal cooperation network
  for each client by optimizing a weighted sum of model similarity and feature complementarity.
  The strength of FedSaC lies in its adaptability to various levels of data heterogeneity
  and multimodal scenarios. Our comprehensive unimodal and multimodal experiments
  demonstrate that FedSaC markedly surpasses other state-of-the-art FL methods.'
