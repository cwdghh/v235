title: Certifiably Byzantine-Robust Federated Conformal Prediction
openreview: 4axAQHwBOE
abstract: Conformal prediction has shown impressive capacity in constructing statistically
  rigorous prediction sets for machine learning models with exchangeable data samples.
  The siloed datasets, coupled with the escalating privacy concerns related to local
  data sharing, have inspired recent innovations extending conformal prediction into
  federated environments with distributed data samples. However, this framework for
  distributed uncertainty quantification is susceptible to Byzantine failures. A minor
  subset of malicious clients can significantly compromise the practicality of coverage
  guarantees. To address this vulnerability, we introduce a novel framework Rob-FCP,
  which executes robust federated conformal prediction, effectively countering malicious
  clients capable of reporting arbitrary statistics with the conformal calibration
  process. We theoretically provide the conformal coverage bound of Rob-FCP in the
  Byzantine setting and show that the coverage of Rob-FCP is asymptotically close
  to the desired coverage level. We also propose a malicious client number estimator
  to tackle a more challenging setting where the number of malicious clients is unknown
  to the defender and theoretically shows its effectiveness. We empirically demonstrate
  the robustness of Rob-FCP against diverse proportions of malicious clients under
  a variety of Byzantine attacks on five standard benchmark and real-world healthcare
  datasets.
