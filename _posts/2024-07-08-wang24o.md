title: An Efficient Maximal Ancestral Graph Listing Algorithm
openreview: MZkqjV4FRT
abstract: Maximal ancestral graph (MAG) is a prevalent graphical model to characterize
  causal relations in the presence of <em>latent variables</em> including latent confounders
  and selection variables. Given observational data, only a Markov equivalence class
  (MEC) of MAGs is identifiable if without some additional assumptions. Due to this
  fact, MAG listing, listing all the MAGs in the MEC, is usually demanded in many
  downstream tasks. To the best of our knowledge, there are no relevant methods for
  MAG listing other than brute force in the literature. In this paper, we propose
  the first brute-force-free MAG listing method, by determining the local structures
  of each vertex recursively. We provide the graphical characterization for each valid
  local transformation of a vertex, and present sound and complete rules to incorporate
  the valid local transformation in the presence of latent confounders and selection
  variables. Based on these components, our method can efficiently output all the
  MAGs in the MEC with no redundance, that is, every intermediate graph in the recursive
  process is necessary for the MAG listing task. The empirical analysis demonstrates
  the superiority of our proposed method on efficiency and effectiveness.
