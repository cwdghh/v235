title: Dissecting Multimodality in VideoQA Transformer Models by Impairing Modality
  Fusion
openreview: Wj5wm3Os5v
abstract: While VideoQA Transformer models demonstrate competitive performance on
  standard benchmarks, the reasons behind their success are not fully understood.
  Do these models capture the rich multimodal structures and dynamics from video and
  text jointly? Or are they achieving high scores by exploiting biases and spurious
  features? Hence, to provide insights, we design <em>QUAG</em> (QUadrant AveraGe),
  a lightweight and non-parametric probe, to conduct dataset-model combined representation
  analysis by impairing modality fusion. We find that the models achieve high performance
  on many datasets without leveraging multimodal representations. To validate QUAG
  further, we design <em>QUAG-attention</em>, a less-expressive replacement of self-attention
  with restricted token interactions. Models with QUAG-attention achieve similar performance
  with significantly fewer multiplication operations without any finetuning. Our findings
  raise doubts about the current modelsâ€™ abilities to learn highly-coupled multimodal
  representations. Hence, we design the <em>CLAVI</em> (Complements in LAnguage and
  VIdeo) dataset, a stress-test dataset curated by augmenting real-world videos to
  have high modality coupling. Consistent with the findings of QUAG, we find that
  most of the models achieve near-trivial performance on CLAVI. This reasserts the
  limitations of current models for learning highly-coupled multimodal representations,
  that is not evaluated by the current datasets.
