title: 'Towards AutoAI: Optimizing a Machine Learning System with Black-box and Differentiable
  Components'
openreview: JVhUR8q27o
abstract: "<em>Machine learning</em> (ML) models in the real world typically do not
  exist in isolation. They are usually part of a complex system (e.g., healthcare
  systems, self-driving cars) containing multiple ML and <em>black-box</em> components.
  The problem of optimizing such systems, which we refer to as <em>automated AI</em>
  (AutoAI), requires us to <em>jointly</em> train all ML components together and presents
  a significant challenge because the number of system parameters is extremely high
  and the system has no analytical form. To circumvent this, we introduce a novel
  algorithm called A-BAD-BO which uses each ML componentâ€™s local loss as an auxiliary
  indicator for system performance. A-BAD-BO uses <em>Bayesian optimization</em> (BO)
  to optimize the local loss configuration of a system in a smaller dimensional space
  and exploits the differentiable structure of ML components to recover optimal system
  parameters from the optimized configuration. We show A-BAD-BO converges to optimal
  system parameters by showing that it is <em>asymptotically no regret</em>. We use
  A-BAD-BO to optimize several synthetic and real-world complex systems, including
  a prompt engineering pipeline for <em>large language models</em> containing millions
  of system parameters. Our results demonstrate that A-BAD-BO yields better system
  optimality than gradient-driven baselines and is more sample-efficient than pure
  BO algorithms."
