title: Unveiling Privacy, Memorization, and Input Curvature Links
openreview: 4dxR7awO5n
abstract: Deep Neural Nets (DNNs) have become a pervasive tool for solving many emerging
  problems. However, they tend to overfit to and memorize the training set. Memorization
  is of keen interest since it is closely related to several concepts such as generalization,
  noisy learning, and privacy. To study memorization, Feldman (2019) proposed a formal
  score, however its computational requirements limit its practical use. Recent research
  has shown empirical evidence linking input loss curvature (measured by the trace
  of the loss Hessian w.r.t inputs) and memorization. It was shown to be $\sim3$ orders
  of magnitude more efficient than calculating the memorization score. However, there
  is a lack of theoretical understanding linking memorization with input loss curvature.
  In this paper, we not only investigate this connection but also extend our analysis
  to establish theoretical links between differential privacy, memorization, and input
  loss curvature. First, we derive an upper bound on memorization characterized by
  both differential privacy and input loss curvature. Secondly, we present a novel
  insight showing that input loss curvature is upper-bounded by the differential privacy
  parameter. Our theoretical findings are further validated using deep models on CIFAR
  and ImageNet datasets, showing a strong correlation between our theoretical predictions
  and results observed in practice.
