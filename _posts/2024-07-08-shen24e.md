title: Adaptive Stabilization Based on Machine Learning for Column Generation
openreview: 7iH9RgMrzX
abstract: Column generation (CG) is a well-established method for solving large-scale
  linear programs. It involves iteratively optimizing a subproblem containing a subset
  of columns and using its dual solution to generate new columns with negative reduced
  costs. This process continues until the dual values converge to the optimal dual
  solution to the original problem. A natural phenomenon in CG is the heavy oscillation
  of the dual values during iterations, which can lead to a substantial slowdown in
  the convergence rate. <em>Stabilization</em> techniques are devised to accelerate
  the convergence of dual values by using information beyond the state of the current
  subproblem. However, there remains a significant gap in obtaining more accurate
  dual values at an earlier stage. To further narrow this gap, this paper introduces
  a novel approach consisting of 1) a <em>machine learning</em> approach for accurate
  prediction of optimal dual solutions and 2) an <em>adaptive stabilization</em> technique
  that effectively capitalizes on accurate predictions. On the graph coloring problem,
  we show that our method achieves a significantly improved convergence rate compared
  to traditional methods.
