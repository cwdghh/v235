title: Hybrid$^2$ Neural ODE Causal Modeling and an Application to Glycemic Response
openreview: GHZVjmaGQM
abstract: 'Hybrid models composing mechanistic ODE-based dynamics with flexible and
  expressive neural network components have grown rapidly in popularity, especially
  in scientific domains where such ODE-based modeling offers important interpretability
  and validated causal grounding (e.g., for counterfactual reasoning). The incorporation
  of mechanistic models also provides inductive bias in standard blackbox modeling
  approaches, critical when learning from small datasets or partially observed, complex
  systems. Unfortunately, as the hybrid models become more flexible, the causal grounding
  provided by the mechanistic model can quickly be lost. We address this problem by
  leveraging another common source of domain knowledge: <em>ranking</em> of treatment
  effects for a set of interventions, even if the precise treatment effect is unknown.
  We encode this information in a <em>causal loss</em> that we combine with the standard
  predictive loss to arrive at a <em>hybrid loss</em> that biases our learning towards
  causally valid hybrid models. We demonstrate our ability to achieve a win-win, state-of-the-art
  predictive performance <em>and</em> causal validity, in the challenging task of
  modeling glucose dynamics post-exercise in individuals with type 1 diabetes.'
