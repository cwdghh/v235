title: Generalization Bounds for Heavy-Tailed SDEs through the Fractional Fokker-Planck
  Equation
openreview: eFSppFiVYG
abstract: Understanding the generalization properties of heavy-tailed stochastic optimization
  algorithms has attracted increasing attention over the past years. While illuminating
  interesting aspects of stochastic optimizers by using heavy-tailed stochastic differential
  equations as proxies, prior works either provided expected generalization bounds,
  or introduced non-computable information theoretic terms. Addressing these drawbacks,
  in this work, we prove high-probability generalization bounds for heavy-tailed SDEs
  which do not contain any nontrivial information theoretic terms. To achieve this
  goal, we develop new proof techniques based on estimating the entropy flows associated
  with the so-called fractional Fokker-Planck equation (a partial differential equation
  that governs the evolution of the distribution of the corresponding heavy-tailed
  SDE). In addition to obtaining high-probability bounds, we show that our bounds
  have a better dependence on the dimension of parameters as compared to prior art.
  Our results further identify a phase transition phenomenon, which suggests that
  heavy tails can be either beneficial or harmful depending on the problem structure.
  We support our theory with experiments conducted in a variety of settings.
