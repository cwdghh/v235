title: Acquisition Conditioned Oracle for Nongreedy Active Feature Acquisition
openreview: kGXUL6qGso
abstract: 'We develop novel methodology for active feature acquisition (AFA), the
  study of sequentially acquiring a dynamic subset of features that minimizes acquisition
  costs whilst still yielding accurate inference. The AFA framework can be useful
  in a myriad of domains, including health care applications where the cost of acquiring
  additional features for a patient (in terms of time, money, risk, etc.) can be weighed
  against the expected improvement to diagnostic performance. Previous approaches
  for AFA have employed either: deep learning RL techniques, which have difficulty
  training policies due to a complicated state and action space; deep learning surrogate
  generative models, which require modeling complicated multidimensional conditional
  distributions; or greedy policies, which cannot account for jointly informative
  feature acquisitions. We show that we can bypass many of these challenges with a
  novel, nonparametric oracle based approach, which we coin the acquisition conditioned
  oracle (ACO). Extensive experiments show the superiority of the ACO to state-of-the-art
  AFA methods when acquiring features for both predictions and general decision-making.'
