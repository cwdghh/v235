title: 'Position: Standardization of Behavioral Use Clauses is Necessary for the Adoption
  of Responsible Licensing of AI'
openreview: 7JKVPNEBkU
abstract: Growing concerns over negligent or malicious uses of AI have increased the
  appetite for tools that help manage the risks of the technology. In 2018, licenses
  with behaviorial-use clauses (commonly referred to as Responsible AI Licenses) were
  proposed to give developers a framework for releasing AI assets while specifying
  their users to mitigate negative applications. As of the end of 2023, on the order
  of 40,000 software and model repositories have adopted responsible AI licenses licenses.
  Notable models licensed with behavioral use clauses include BLOOM (language) and
  LLaMA2 (language), Stable Diffusion (image), and GRID (robotics). This paper explores
  why and how these licenses have been adopted, and why and how they have been adapted
  to fit particular use cases. We use a mixed-methods methodology of qualitative interviews,
  clustering of license clauses, and quantitative analysis of license adoption. Based
  on this evidence we take the position that responsible AI licenses need standardization
  to avoid confusing users or diluting their impact. At the same time, customization
  of behavioral restrictions is also appropriate in some contexts (e.g., medical domains).
  We advocate for “standardized customization” that can meet users’ needs and can
  be supported via tooling.
