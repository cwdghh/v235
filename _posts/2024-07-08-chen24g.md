title: Policy-conditioned Environment Models are More Generalizable
openreview: g9mYBdooPA
abstract: In reinforcement learning, it is crucial to have an accurate environment
  dynamics model to evaluate different policies’ value in downstream tasks like offline
  policy optimization and policy evaluation. However, the learned model is known to
  be inaccurate in predictions when evaluating target policies different from data-collection
  policies. In this work, we found that utilizing policy representation for model
  learning, called policy-conditioned model (PCM) learning, is useful to mitigate
  the problem, especially when the offline dataset is collected from diversified behavior
  policies. The reason beyond that is in this case, PCM becomes a meta-dynamics model
  that is trained to be aware of and focus on the evaluation policies that on-the-fly
  adjust the model to be suitable to the evaluation policies’ state-action distribution,
  thus improving the prediction accuracy. Based on that intuition, we propose an easy-to-implement
  yet effective algorithm of PCM for accurate model learning. We also give a theoretical
  analysis and experimental evidence to demonstrate the feasibility of reducing value
  gaps by adapting the dynamics model under different policies. Experiment results
  show that PCM outperforms the existing SOTA off-policy evaluation methods in the
  DOPE benchmark by a large margin, and derives significantly better policies in offline
  policy selection and model predictive control compared with the standard model learning
  method.
