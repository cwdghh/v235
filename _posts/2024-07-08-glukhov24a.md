title: 'Position: Fundamental Limitations of LLM Censorship Necessitate New Approaches'
openreview: j5csKrtyAe
abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities in comprehending
  complex instructions. However, their blind adherence to provided instructions has
  led to concerns regarding risks of malicious use. Existing defence mechanisms, such
  as model fine-tuning or output censorship methods have proven to be fallible at
  ensuring that LLMs do not return semantically impermissible responses. We present
  fundamental limitations of verifying the semantic properties of LLM outputs and
  identifying compositional threats, illustrating inherent challenges of current approaches
  to censoring LLM outputs. Specifically, we demonstrate that semantic censorship
  can be perceived as an undecidable problem, and semantic properties of LLM outputs
  can become impossible to verify when the LLM is capable of providing "encrypted"
  outputs. We further show challenges of censorship can extend beyond just semantic
  censorship, as attackers can reconstruct impermissible outputs from a collection
  of permissible ones. Consequently, we call for a re-evaluation of the problem of
  censorship and its goals, stressing the need for new definitions and approaches
  to censorship. In addition, we provide an initial attempt toward achieving this
  goal through syntactic censorship, drawing from a security perspective to design
  censorship methods that can provide guarantees.
