title: 'Position: Mission Critical – Satellite Data is a Distinct Modality in Machine
  Learning'
openreview: PQ0ERKKYJu
abstract: Satellite data has the potential to inspire a seismic shift for machine
  learning—one in which we rethink existing practices designed for traditional data
  modalities. As machine learning for satellite data (SatML) gains traction for its
  real-world impact, our field is at a crossroads. We can either continue applying
  ill-suited approaches, or we can initiate a new research agenda that centers around
  the unique characteristics and challenges of satellite data. This position paper
  argues that satellite data constitutes a distinct modality for machine learning
  research and that we must recognize it as such to advance the quality and impact
  of SatML research across theory, methods, and deployment. We outline research directions,
  critical discussion questions and actionable suggestions to transform SatML from
  merely an intriguing application area to a dedicated research discipline that helps
  move the needle on big challenges for machine learning and society.
