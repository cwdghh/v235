title: 'From Neurons to Neutrons: A Case Study in Interpretability'
openreview: XMlUlY7ONf
abstract: 'Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) proposes a path toward fully understanding
  how neural networks make their predictions. Prior work demonstrates that even when
  trained to perform simple arithmetic, models can implement a variety of algorithms
  (sometimes concurrently) depending on initialization and hyperparameters. Does this
  mean neuron-level interpretability techniques have limited applicability? Here,
  we argue that high-dimensional neural networks can learn <em>useful</em> low-dimensional
  representations of the data they were trained on, going beyond simply making good
  predictions: Such representations can be understood with the MI lens and provide
  insights that are surprisingly faithful to human-derived domain knowledge. This
  indicates that such approaches to interpretability can be useful for deriving a
  new understanding of a problem from models trained to solve it. As a case study,
  we extract nuclear physics concepts by studying models trained to reproduce nuclear
  data.'
