title: Partially Stochastic Infinitely Deep Bayesian Neural Networks
openreview: jNab9mXEyj
abstract: In this paper, we present Partially Stochastic Infinitely Deep Bayesian
  Neural Networks, a novel family of architectures that integrates partial stochasticity
  into the framework of infinitely deep neural networks. Our new class of architectures
  is designed to improve the computational efficiency of existing architectures at
  training and inference time. To do this, we leverage the advantages of partial stochasticity
  in the infinite-depth limit which include the benefits of full stochasticity e.g.
  robustness, uncertainty quantification, and memory efficiency, whilst improving
  their limitations around computational complexity. We present a variety of architectural
  configurations, offering flexibility in network design including different methods
  for weight partition. We also provide mathematical guarantees on the expressivity
  of our models by establishing that our network family qualifies as Universal Conditional
  Distribution Approximators. Lastly, empirical evaluations across multiple tasks
  show that our proposed architectures achieve better downstream task performance
  and uncertainty quantification than their counterparts while being significantly
  more efficient. The code can be found at https://github.com/Sergio20f/part_stoch_inf_deep
