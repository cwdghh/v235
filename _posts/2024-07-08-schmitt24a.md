title: Leveraging Self-Consistency for Data-Efficient Amortized Bayesian Inference
openreview: 6wVlH96oMX
abstract: We propose a method to improve the efficiency and accuracy of amortized
  Bayesian inference by leveraging universal symmetries in the joint probabilistic
  model of parameters and data. In a nutshell, we invert Bayes’ theorem and estimate
  the marginal likelihood based on approximate representations of the joint model.
  Upon perfect approximation, the marginal likelihood is constant across all parameter
  values by definition. However, errors in approximate inference lead to undesirable
  variance in the marginal likelihood estimates across different parameter values.
  We penalize violations of this symmetry with a self-consistency loss which significantly
  improves the quality of approximate inference in low data regimes and can be used
  to augment the training of popular neural density estimators. We apply our method
  to a number of synthetic problems and realistic scientific models, discovering notable
  advantages in the context of both neural posterior and likelihood approximation.
