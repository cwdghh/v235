title: 'SceneCraft: An LLM Agent for Synthesizing 3D Scenes as Blender Code'
openreview: gAyzjHw2ml
abstract: This paper introduces SceneCraft, a Large Language Model (LLM) Agent converting
  text descriptions into Blender-executable Python scripts which render complex scenes
  with up to a hundred 3D assets. This process requires complex spatial planning and
  arrangement. We tackle these challenges through a combination of advanced abstraction,
  strategic planning, and library learning. SceneCraft first models a scene graph
  as a blueprint, detailing the spatial relationships among assets in the scene. SceneCraft
  then writes Python scripts based on this graph, translating relationships into numerical
  constraints for asset layout. Next, SceneCraft leverages the perceptual strengths
  of vision-language foundation models like GPT-V to analyze rendered images and iteratively
  refine the scene. On top of this process, SceneCraft features a library learning
  mechanism that compiles common script functions into a reusable library, facilitating
  continuous self-improvement without expensive LLM parameter tuning. Our evaluation
  demonstrates that SceneCraft surpasses existing LLM-based agents in rendering complex
  scenes, as shown by its adherence to constraints and favorable human assessments.
  We also showcase the broader application potential of SceneCraft by reconstructing
  detailed 3D scenes from the Sintel movie and guiding a video generative model with
  generated scenes as intermediary control signal.
