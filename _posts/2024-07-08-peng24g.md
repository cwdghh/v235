title: 'FedCal: Achieving Local and Global Calibration in Federated Learning via Aggregated
  Parameterized Scaler'
openreview: XecUTmB9yD
abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative machine learning across distributed
  data owners, but data heterogeneity poses a challenge for model calibration. While
  prior work focused on improving accuracy for non-iid data, calibration remains under-explored.
  This study reveals existing FL aggregation approaches lead to sub-optimal calibration,
  and theoretical analysis shows despite constraining variance in clientsâ€™ label distributions,
  global calibration error is still asymptotically lower bounded. To address this,
  we propose a novel Federated Calibration (FedCal) approach, emphasizing both local
  and global calibration. It leverages client-specific scalers for local calibration
  to effectively correct output misalignment without sacrificing prediction accuracy.
  These scalers are then aggregated via weight averaging to generate a global scaler,
  minimizing the global calibration error. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
  FedCal significantly outperforms the best-performing baseline, reducing global calibration
  error by 47.66% on average.
