title: Neural Collapse for Cross-entropy Class-Imbalanced Learning with Unconstrained
  ReLU Features Model
openreview: YBetKvUlF7
abstract: The current paradigm of training deep neural networks for classification
  tasks includes minimizing the empirical risk, pushing the training loss value towards
  zero even after the training classification error has vanished. In this terminal
  phase of training, it has been observed that the last-layer features collapse to
  their class-means and these class-means converge to the vertices of a simplex Equiangular
  Tight Frame (ETF). This phenomenon is termed as Neural Collapse ($\mathcal{NC}$).
  However, this characterization only holds in class-balanced datasets where every
  class has the same number of training samples. When the training dataset is class-imbalanced,
  some $\mathcal{NC}$ properties will no longer hold true, for example, the geometry
  of class-means will skew away from the simplex ETF. In this paper, we generalize
  $\mathcal{NC}$ to imbalanced regime for cross-entropy loss under the unconstrained
  ReLU features model. We demonstrate that while the within-class features collapse
  property still holds in this setting, the class-means will converge to a structure
  consisting of orthogonal vectors with lengths dependent on the number of training
  samples. Furthermore, we find that the classifier weights (i.e., the last-layer
  linear classifier) are aligned to the scaled and centered class-means, with scaling
  factors dependent on the number of training samples of each class. This generalizes
  $\mathcal{NC}$ in the class-balanced setting. We empirically validate our results
  through experiments on practical architectures and dataset.
