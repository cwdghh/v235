title: Mean-field Chaos Diffusion Models
openreview: lgcFX4VFrM
abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new class of score-based generative models
  (SGMs) designed to handle high-cardinality data distributions by leveraging concepts
  from mean-field theory. We present mean-field chaos diffusion models (MF-CDMs),
  which address the curse of dimensionality inherent in high-cardinality data by utilizing
  the propagation of chaos property of interacting particles. By treating high-cardinality
  data as a large stochastic system of interacting particles, we develop a novel score-matching
  method for infinite-dimensional chaotic particle systems and propose an approximation
  scheme that employs a subdivision strategy for efficient training. Our theoretical
  and empirical results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of MF-CDMs for
  managing large high-cardinality data structures, such as 3D point clouds.
