title: Counterfactual Image Editing
openreview: OXzkw7vFIO
abstract: 'Counterfactual image editing is a challenging task within generative AI.
  The current literature on the topic focuses primarily on changing individual features
  while being silent about the causal relationships between features, which are present
  in the real world. In this paper, we first formalize this task through causal language,
  modeling the causal relationships between latent generative factors and images through
  a special type of causal model called <em>augmented structural causal models (ASCMs)</em>.
  Second, we show two fundamental impossibility results: (1) counterfactual editing
  is impossible from i.i.d. image samples and their corresponding labels alone; (2)
  also, even when the causal relationships between latent generative factors and images
  are available, no guarantees regarding the output of the generative model can be
  provided. Third, we propose a relaxation over this hard problem aiming to approximate
  the non-identifiable target counterfactual distributions while still preserving
  features the users care about and that are causally consistent with the true generative
  model, which we call <b>ctf-consistent estimators</b>. Finally, we develop an efficient
  algorithm to generate counterfactual image samples leveraging neural causal models.'
