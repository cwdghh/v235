title: The Expressive Power of Path-Based Graph Neural Networks
openreview: io1XSRtcO8
abstract: We systematically investigate the expressive power of path-based graph neural
  networks. While it has been shown that path-based graph neural networks can achieve
  strong empirical results, an investigation into their expressive power is lacking.
  Therefore, we propose PATH-WL, a general class of color refinement algorithms based
  on paths and shortest path distance information. We show that PATH-WL is incomparable
  to a wide range of expressive graph neural networks, can count cycles, and achieves
  strong empirical results on the notoriously difficult family of strongly regular
  graphs. Our theoretical results indicate that PATH-WL forms a new hierarchy of highly
  expressive graph neural networks.
