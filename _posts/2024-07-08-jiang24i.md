title: Generalized Neural Collapse for a Large Number of Classes
openreview: D4B7kkB89m
abstract: Neural collapse provides an elegant mathematical characterization of learned
  last layer representations (a.k.a. features) and classifier weights in deep classification
  models. Such results not only provide insights but also motivate new techniques
  for improving practical deep models. However, most of the existing empirical and
  theoretical studies in neural collapse focus on the case that the number of classes
  is small relative to the dimension of the feature space. This paper extends neural
  collapse to cases where the number of classes are much larger than the dimension
  of feature space, which broadly occur for language models, retrieval systems, and
  face recognition applications. We show that the features and classifier exhibit
  a generalized neural collapse phenomenon, where the minimum one-vs-rest margins
  is maximized. We provide empirical study to verify the occurrence of generalized
  neural collapse in practical deep neural networks. Moreover, we provide theoretical
  study to show that the generalized neural collapse provably occurs under unconstrained
  feature model with spherical constraint, under certain technical conditions on feature
  dimension and number of classes.
