title: 'RMIB: Representation Matching Information Bottleneck for Matching Text Representations'
openreview: hsHIxrnrMx
abstract: Recent studies have shown that the domain matching of text representations
  will help improve the generalization ability of asymmetrical domains text matching
  tasks. This requires that the distribution of text representations should be as
  similar as possible, similar to matching with heterogeneous data domains, in order
  to make the data after feature extraction indistinguishable. However, how to match
  the distribution of text representations remains an open question, and the role
  of text representations distribution match is still unclear. In this work, we explicitly
  narrow the distribution of text representations by matching them with the same prior
  distribution. We theoretically prove that narrowing the distribution of text representations
  in asymmetrical domains text matching is equivalent to optimizing the information
  bottleneck (IB). Since the interaction between text representations plays an important
  role in asymmetrical domains text matching, IB does not restrict the interaction
  between text representations. Therefore, we propose the adequacy of interaction
  and the incompleteness of a single text representation on the basis of IB and obtain
  the representation matching information bottleneck (RMIB). We theoretically prove
  that the constraints on text representations in RMIB is equivalent to maximizing
  the mutual information between text representations on the premise that the task
  information is given. On four text matching models and five text matching datasets,
  we verify that RMIB can improve the performance of asymmetrical domains text matching.
