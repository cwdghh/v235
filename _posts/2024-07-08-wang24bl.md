title: Generalization Analysis of Stochastic Weight Averaging with General Sampling
openreview: XwVkqvyziD
abstract: 'Stochastic weight averaging (SWA) method has empirically proven its advantages
  compared to stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Despite it is widespread used, theoretical
  investigations have been limited, particularly in scenarios beyond the ideal setting
  of convex and sampling with replacement. However, non-convex cases and sampling
  without replacement are very practical in real-world applications. The main challenges
  under the above settings are two-folds: (i) All the historical gradient information
  introduced by SWA is considered, while the analysis of SGD using the tool of uniform
  stability requires only to bound the current gradient. (ii) The $(1+\alpha\beta)$-expansion
  property causes the boundary of each gradient step dependent on the previous step,
  making the boundary of each historical gradient in SWA nested and the theoretical
  analysis even harder. To address the theoretical challenges, we adopt mathematical
  induction to find a recursive representation that bounds the gradient at each step.
  Based on this, we establish stability bounds supporting sampling with and without
  replacement in the non-convex setting. Furthermore, the derived generalization bounds
  of SWA are sharper than SGD. At last, experimental results on several benchmarks
  verify our theoretical results.'
