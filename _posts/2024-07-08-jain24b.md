title: Learning to Reach Goals via Diffusion
openreview: 3JhmHCVPa8
abstract: We present a novel perspective on goal-conditioned reinforcement learning
  by framing it within the context of denoising diffusion models. Analogous to the
  diffusion process, where Gaussian noise is used to create random trajectories that
  walk away from the data manifold, we construct trajectories that move away from
  potential goal states. We then learn a goal-conditioned policy to reverse these
  deviations, analogous to the score function. This approach, which we call Merlin,
  can reach specified goals from arbitrary initial states without learning a separate
  value function. In contrast to recent works utilizing diffusion models in offline
  RL, Merlin stands out as the first method to perform diffusion in the state space,
  requiring only one "denoising" iteration per environment step. We experimentally
  validate our approach in various offline goal-reaching tasks, demonstrating substantial
  performance enhancements compared to state-of-the-art methods while improving computational
  efficiency over other diffusion-based RL methods by an order of magnitude. Our results
  suggest that this perspective on diffusion for RL is a simple and scalable approach
  for sequential decision making.
