title: A Global Geometric Analysis of Maximal Coding Rate Reduction
openreview: u9qmjV2khT
abstract: 'The maximal coding rate reduction (MCR$^2$) objective for learning structured
  and compact deep representations is drawing increasing attention, especially after
  its recent usage in the derivation of fully explainable and highly effective deep
  network architectures. However, it lacks a complete theoretical justification: only
  the properties of its global optima are known, and its global landscape has not
  been studied. In this work, we give a complete characterization of the properties
  of all its local and global optima as well as other types of critical points. Specifically,
  we show that each (local or global) maximizer of the MCR$^2$ problem corresponds
  to a low-dimensional, discriminative, and diverse representation, and furthermore,
  each critical point of the objective is either a local maximizer or a strict saddle
  point. Such a favorable landscape makes MCR$^2$ a natural choice of objective for
  learning diverse and discriminative representations via first-order optimization.
  To further verify our theoretical findings, we illustrate these properties with
  extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data sets.'
