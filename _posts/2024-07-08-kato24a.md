title: Active Adaptive Experimental Design for Treatment Effect Estimation with Covariate
  Choice
openreview: K6HpbvkrwO
abstract: This study designs an adaptive experiment for efficiently estimating <em>average
  treatment effects</em> (ATEs). In each round of our adaptive experiment, an experimenter
  sequentially samples an experimental unit, assigns a treatment, and observes the
  corresponding outcome immediately. At the end of the experiment, the experimenter
  estimates an ATE using the gathered samples. The objective is to estimate the ATE
  with a smaller asymptotic variance. Existing studies have designed experiments that
  adaptively optimize the propensity score (treatment-assignment probability). As
  a generalization of such an approach, we propose optimizing the covariate density
  as well as the propensity score. First, we derive the efficient covariate density
  and propensity score that minimize the semiparametric efficiency bound and find
  that optimizing both covariate density and propensity score minimizes the semiparametric
  efficiency bound more effectively than optimizing only the propensity score. Next,
  we design an adaptive experiment using the efficient covariate density and propensity
  score sequentially estimated during the experiment. Lastly, we propose an ATE estimator
  whose asymptotic variance aligns with the minimized semiparametric efficiency bound.
