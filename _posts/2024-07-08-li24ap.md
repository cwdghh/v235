title: A Neural-Guided Dynamic Symbolic Network for Exploring Mathematical Expressions
  from Data
openreview: IejxxE9DO2
abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) is a powerful technique for discovering the underlying
  mathematical expressions from observed data. Inspired by the success of deep learning,
  recent deep generative SR methods have shown promising results. However, these methods
  face difficulties in processing high-dimensional problems and learning constants
  due to the large search space, and they donâ€™t scale well to unseen problems. In
  this work, we propose DySymNet, a novel neural-guided <b>Dy</b>namic <b>Sym</b>bolic
  <b>Net</b>work for SR. Instead of searching for expressions within a large search
  space, we explore symbolic networks with various structures, guided by reinforcement
  learning, and optimize them to identify expressions that better-fitting the data.
  Based on extensive numerical experiments on low-dimensional public standard benchmarks
  and the well-known SRBench with more variables, DySymNet shows clear superiority
  over several representative baseline models. Open source code is available at https://github.com/AILWQ/DySymNet.
