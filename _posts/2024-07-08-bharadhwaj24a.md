title: 'Position: Scaling Simulation is Neither Necessary Nor Sufficient for In-the-Wild
  Robot Manipulation'
openreview: Jtjurj7oIJ
abstract: In this paper, we develop a structured critique of robotic simulations for
  real-world manipulation, by arguing that scaling simulators is neither necessary
  nor sufficient for making progress in general-purpose real-world robotic manipulation
  agents that are compliant with human preferences. With the ubiquity of robotic simulators,
  and recent efforts to scale them for diverse tasks, and at the same time the interest
  in generally capable real-world manipulation systems, we believe it is important
  to address the limitations of using simulation for real-world manipulation, so that
  as a community, we can focus our collective resources, energy, and time on approaches
  that have more principled odds of success. We further demonstrate the unique challenges
  that real-world manipulation presents, and show through examples and arguments why
  scaling simulation doesnâ€™t get us closer to solving these challenges required for
  diverse real-world deployment.
