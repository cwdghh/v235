title: Explaining Graph Neural Networks via Structure-aware Interaction Index
openreview: 2T00oYk54P
abstract: The Shapley value is a prominent tool for interpreting black-box machine
  learning models thanks to its strong theoretical foundation. However, for models
  with structured inputs, such as graph neural networks, existing Shapley-based explainability
  approaches either focus solely on node-wise importance or neglect the graph structure
  when perturbing the input instance. This paper introduces the Myerson-Taylor interaction
  index that internalizes the graph structure into attributing the node values and
  the interaction values among nodes. Unlike the Shapley-based methods, the Myerson-Taylor
  index decomposes coalitions into components satisfying a pre-chosen connectivity
  criterion. We prove that the Myerson-Taylor index is the unique one that satisfies
  a system of five natural axioms accounting for graph structure and high-order interaction
  among nodes. Leveraging these properties, we propose Myerson-Taylor Structure-Aware
  Graph Explainer (MAGE), a novel explainer that uses the second-order Myerson-Taylor
  index to identify the most important motifs influencing the model prediction, both
  positively and negatively. Extensive experiments on various graph datasets and models
  demonstrate that our method consistently provides superior subgraph explanations
  compared to state-of-the-art methods.
