title: Robust Classification via a Single Diffusion Model
openreview: xaSpuvNYwS
abstract: Diffusion models have been applied to improve adversarial robustness of
  image classifiers by purifying the adversarial noises or generating realistic data
  for adversarial training. However, diffusion-based purification can be evaded by
  stronger adaptive attacks while adversarial training does not perform well under
  unseen threats, exhibiting inevitable limitations of these methods. To better harness
  the expressive power of diffusion models, this paper proposes Robust Diffusion Classifier
  (RDC), a generative classifier that is constructed from a pre-trained diffusion
  model to be adversarially robust. RDC first maximizes the data likelihood of a given
  input and then predicts the class probabilities of the optimized input using the
  conditional likelihood estimated by the diffusion model through Bayesâ€™ theorem.
  To further reduce the computational cost, we propose a new diffusion backbone called
  multi-head diffusion and develop efficient sampling strategies. As RDC does not
  require training on particular adversarial attacks, we demonstrate that it is more
  generalizable to defend against multiple unseen threats. In particular, RDC achieves
  $75.67%$ robust accuracy against various $\ell_\infty$ norm-bounded adaptive attacks
  with $\epsilon_\infty=8/255$ on CIFAR-10, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art
  adversarial training models by $+4.77%$. The results highlight the potential of
  generative classifiers by employing pre-trained diffusion models for adversarial
  robustness compared with the commonly studied discriminative classifiers.
