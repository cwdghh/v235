title: Understanding Server-Assisted Federated Learning in the Presence of Incomplete
  Client Participation
openreview: zwUEk9WpsR
abstract: Existing works in federated learning (FL) often assume either full client
  or uniformly distributed client participation. However, in reality, some clients
  may never participate in FL training (aka incomplete client participation) due to
  various system heterogeneity factors. A popular solution is the server-assisted
  federated learning (SA-FL) framework, where the server uses an auxiliary dataset.
  Despite empirical evidence of SA-FLâ€™s effectiveness in addressing incomplete client
  participation, theoretical understanding of SA-FL is lacking. Furthermore, the effects
  of incomplete client participation in conventional FL are poorly understood. This
  motivates us to rigorously investigate SA-FL. Toward this end, we first show that
  conventional FL is <em>not</em> PAC-learnable under incomplete client participation
  in the worst case. Then, we show that the PAC-learnability of FL with incomplete
  client participation can indeed be revived by SA-FL, which theoretically justifies
  the use of SA-FL for the first time. Lastly, to provide practical guidance for SA-FL
  training under <em>incomplete client participation</em>, we propose the SAFARI (server-assisted
  federated averaging) algorithm that enjoys the same linear convergence speedup guarantees
  as classic FL with ideal client participation assumptions, offering the first SA-FL
  algorithm with convergence guarantee. Extensive experiments on different datasets
  show SAFARI significantly improves the performance under incomplete client participation.
