title: 'Incorporating Information into Shapley Values: Reweighting via a Maximum Entropy
  Approach'
openreview: DwniHlwcOB
abstract: Both the marginal contributions needed for the computation of Shapley values
  and the graph produced by Pearl-Verma theorem rely on the choice of an ordering
  of the variables. For Shapley values, the marginal contributions are averaged over
  all orderings, while in causal inference methods, the typical approach is to select
  orderings producing a graph with a minimal number of edges. We reconcile both approaches
  by reinterpreting them from a maximum entropy perspective. Namely, Shapley values
  assume no prior knowledge about the orderings and treat them as equally likely,
  while causal inference approaches apply Occam’s razor and consider only orderings
  producing the simplest explanatory graphs. We find that the blind application of
  Occam’s razor to Shapley values does not produce fully satisfactory explanations.
  Hence, we propose two variations of Shapley values based on entropy maximization
  to appropriately incorporate prior information about the model. Hence, we propose
  a variation of Shapley values based on entropy maximization to appropriately incorporate
  prior information about the model.
